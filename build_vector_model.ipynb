When discussing collective responsibility for climate change, “collective” can thus refer to the problem of climate change itself, or to the entity causing the harm and/or bearing responsibility for it. The first viewpoint focuses on how climate change is a harm that has been caused collectively.Collective action problemrefers to an aggregation of individual actions which together produce an outcome that is not intended at the level of an individual action. It cannot be solved by any one agent acting unilaterally. Instead, climate change action must be enacted and supported by numerous agents. The second way to conceptualize climate change as a question of collective responsibility focuses on the collective entities that bear responsibility for climate change. As a global problem, climate change is linked to the realm of international politics, where states, governments, and intergovernmental organizations are the main collective entities. Other important agential collectives in terms of climate responsibility are corporations, including carbon majors who have produced the bulk of emissions. Climate change has also been theorized as astructural injustice, which combines elements from both the viewpoints on what is collective about responsibility for climate change.This article is categorized under:Climate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate ChangeClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.830'}, {'id': 427, 'title': 'Erratum to “How climate change interacts with inequity to affect nutrition”', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-11', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.854'}, {'id': 428, 'title': 'Climate change on Twitter: Implications for climate governance research', 'authors': 'Lisa Dellmuth, Karina Shyrokykh', 'published': '2023-11', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': \"AbstractThere is increasing public debate about the governance of climate change and its repercussions for nature and human livelihoods.

We see significant advancement in the environmental social sciences studying these two areas. Yet, we also see the need for a better understanding of how public and private actors in the climate governance complex interact on Twitter, and how these actors shape, and are shaped by, experiences, values, and positions. This understanding will help to advance climate governance theories. This article proceeds in three steps. We first discuss previous social media research on non‐state climate action and public opinion formation related to climate change and its governance. Then we sketch avenues for future research, elaborating how Twitter data might be used to investigate how non‐state climate action and public opinion formation on social media are linked to and influence climate governance. We conclude by making the case for drawing together Twitter data and climate governance research into a more coherent research agenda.This article is categorized under:\\nPolicy and Governance > Private Governance of Climate Change\\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Communication\\nPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy\\nPolicy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance\\n\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.848'}, {'id': 429, 'title': 'Speculative Design with Generative AI: Applying Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT to imagining climate change futures', 'authors': 'RAY LC, Yuying Tang', 'published': '2023-11-28', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3632776.3632827'}, {'id': 430, 'title': 'Maximising Net Zero in Energy-Intensive Industries: An Overview of AI Applications for Greenhouse Gas Reduction', 'authors': 'Atul Saggar, Bhawna Nigam', 'published': '2023-3-13', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'The impact of global warming on the environment is a significant concern, and finding effective ways to address climate change is a priority.

Most existing climate‐migration research is heavily environment‐centric, even when acknowledging the importance of contextual or intervening factors. In contrast, the framework proposed here considers five different pathways through which climate change is affecting, or might affect, migration: short‐term shocks, long‐term climatic and related changes, environmental “pull” factors, climate adaptation and mitigation measures, and perceptions and narratives. In reviewing the existing evidence relating to each of these pathways, the paper finds among other things that short‐term shocks may simultaneously increase and reduce migration; that the evidence on long‐term trends provides a weak basis for understanding future dynamics; and that more attention needs to be paid to the other three pathways, by researchers and policymakers alike. Overall, the proposed framework and associated evidence review suggest a different and broader understanding of the migration implications of climate change from that outlined in the IPCC's most recent assessment, or in many existing reviews.This article is categorized under:\\nClimate and Development Knowledge and Action in Development\\n\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.886'}, {'id': 432, 'title': 'Simulation of Mangrove Suitable Habitat in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Area Under the Background of Climate Change', 'authors': 'Jiali Zeng, Bin Ai, Zhuokai Jian, Jun Zhao, Shaojie Sun', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4402077'}, {'id': 433, 'title': 'Digital Twin Earth for Climate Change Adapation: An AI based Federated System', 'authors': 'M.

Here, we review 103 articles covering the topic of climate change adaptation and well‐being.

We then propose an approach informed by emic values to better understand how climate change may affect well‐being in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities.

This advanced review offers a critical overview of the key themes of this literature with the primary intention of enabling historians and other scholars to recognize, specify, and acknowledge the roles of imperial and colonial processes in shaping scientific framings of climate. Following a brief overview of debates in older literature over the significance of imperialism and colonialism in climate sciences, the article investigates the wealth of recent scholarship that demonstrates specific and diverse connections between empires and climate science. Major features of this scholarship include: the role and the erasure of Indigenous and local knowledge; imperial climate infrastructures and visions; and climate data and theories in land empires as well as in informal empires and neocolonial settings.

Calamitous images of the future are not pathological or counterproductive: it is both necessary and valuable to imagine the worst‐case scenarios of climate change. Critics of climate catastrophe often group together all visions of disastrous futures under labels like doomism or pessimism. This is unhelpful and greater nuance is required. We need to distinguish between climate doomists (who see catastrophe as imminent and unavoidable) and climate risk realists (who see catastrophe as one potential future that should be avoided). We also need to split apart the different ways of envisioning climate catastrophe to understand their distinct strengths and weaknesses. We outline and compare three alternative modes of viewing the worst‐case scenarios of climate change: foresight, agitation, and fiction. The first centers on modeling catastrophic climate scenarios, the second on the use of images of climate catastrophe for political action, and the third on fictional visions of future climate disasters. These different approaches are complementary and should be better integrated to create more comprehensive models of the future. All of them would benefit from viewing the future as uncertain, reflecting on the social position of the author, and guarding against the authoritarian “stomp reflex” that can be induced by discussions of crisis and emergency.This article is categorized under:\\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change\\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Perceptions of Climate Change\\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.871'}, {'id': 443, 'title': 'Research Handbook on Climate Change Law &amp; Loss and Damage', 'authors': 'Megna Murali', 'published': '2023-2-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/scc.2023.0006'}, {'id': 444, 'title': 'Psychological Distance in Climate Change: The Role of Climate Change Denial, Contact with Nature and Political Opinion', 'authors': 'Gökhan ŞAHİN', 'published': '2023-9-30', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"This study was designed to investigate the psychological distance perception of Turkish people and the role of their political views on climate change.

Further, the performance of various climate models in monsoon degrades drastically due to the skewed nature. Under these circumstances, the performance of the climate model in the monsoon and non-monsoon periods is critical for accurate assessment. A multimodal approach has been used in the present work to quantify the uncertainty involved in the climate model using reliability ensemble averaging (REA). Based on AR6 of IPCC, the ensemble of 26 global climate models (GCMs) was used to evaluate the model performance and possible change in seasonal precipitation in four cities with distinct climate conditions, namely, Coimbatore, Rajkot, Udaipur, and Siliguri. The results show that non-monsoon and monsoon rainfall are expected to increase in all the regions. Most of the models perform poorly in simulating monsoon climate, especially in the monsoon period and are highly inconsistent spatially. The study also finds that the model performance is largely linked to the ratio of natural variability and mean.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.393'}, {'id': 468, 'title': 'Discrepancies in academic perceptions of climate change and implications for climate change education', 'authors': 'Marcellus Forh Mbah', 'published': '2024-4-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'AbstractClimate change is arguably the most severe threat faced by humanity today.

We argue that addressing the growing and compounding risks and impacts of climate change requires a fundamental rethink and transformation of cultural heritage management and policy. In this article, we propose a climate‐smart cultural heritage (CSCH) approach that captures the notion that climate adaptation can be developed and implemented within the heritage sector to simultaneously reduce the impacts of changing climate and variability on tangible and intangible cultural heritage and provide co‐benefits for climate change mitigation while also enhancing human security at different spatial scales. The CSCH is an integrated approach to implementing forward‐looking and transformative cultural heritage management and policy and is not a new set of practices to be advocated to cultural heritage stakeholders and decision‐makers. Findings also demonstrate that institutional mechanisms such as multi‐stakeholder planning, increased awareness of the economic, social, and environmental benefits of diverse cultural heritage, improved cross‐sectoral coordination and communication, strong political will for transformative approaches, and investments in CSCH are necessary for implementation of CSCH.This article is categorized under:\\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives\\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making\\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change > Assessing Climate Change in the Context of Other Issues\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.855'}, {'id': 470, 'title': 'Climate change in Western Australia and its impact on human health', 'authors': 'Natalie Teasdale, Peter K Panegyres', 'published': '2023-7', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2023.100243'}, {'id': 471, 'title': 'Innovating patient care in the era of climate change', 'authors': 'Alison Chang, Katherine Gundling', 'published': '2023-9', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2023.100250'}, {'id': 472, 'title': 'Neurology and climate change: What we know and where we are going', 'authors': 'Jonathan Doan, Andrew Dhawan', 'published': '2024-3', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2023.100284'}, {'id': 473, 'title': 'Altering Attitudes on Climate Change: Testing the Effect of Time Orientation and Motivation Framing', 'authors': 'Kylie Clark, Aubrie Adams', 'published': '2023-8-16', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.55671/2771-5582.1019'}, {'id': 474, 'title': 'Policy for material efficiency in homes and cars: Enabling new climate change mitigation strategies', 'authors': 'Reid Lifset, Edgar Hertwich, Tamar Makov', 'published': '2024-3-14', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'AbstractMaterial efficiency (ME), making products with less material or substituting with less carbon‐intensive material without a loss of functionality, can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and complement other strategies to mitigate climate change. Seven ME strategies for cars and homes in the G7 countries were recently modeled in a study by the International Resource Panel. Modeling indicates that ME strategies focusing on construction and use of homes could lower the overall cumulative emissions in the G7 between 2016 and 2060 by 8.5 Gt CO2e (20%), while ME strategies for the production and use of cars could reduce up to 12 Gt (24%). For both homes and cars, the strategy of more intensive use—where fewer or smaller products are required to provide the same basic service—showed the greatest potential. A review of existing ME policies reveals that attention to ME in climate policy has been limited. Policy toward ME has historically focused on waste management rather than GHG reduction. Ex post evaluation of policies that do exist, especially for recycling and related waste strategies, is infrequent. Framing efficient use of materials as a measure primarily intended for climate mitigation is relatively recent and uncommon. Production‐related policy opportunities have been neglected because using ME to reduce GHGs is novel in some sectors and because increased ME faces economic and social barriers. Rebound effects where reduction of the cost of housing or transportation can increase material consumption offsetting potential gains, a problem for all efficiency‐based approaches, is understudied and not currently addressed through policy.This article is categorized under:\\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Policies, Instruments, Lifestyles, Behavior\\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Decarbonizing Energy and/or Reducing Demand\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.881'}, {'id': 475, 'title': 'Greetings from the new editor!', 'authors': 'Alice C.

Their analysis suggests that these emotions can be categorised by their stimuli into those related to the classroom: activities, outcomes, relationships, topics and knowledge processes (epistemic). Most research in this area has focused on achievement emotions, with relatively limited research exploring topic emotions. This paper develops a framework for conceptualising topic emotions. It reports on a design‐based study that captured children's expressions of emotion in response to a climate change education programme using picturebooks. The data brought together emotional responses to climate change, to learning about climate change and to climate‐related picturebooks. Qualitative analysis of these responses highlights how they differ not only with regard to the emotions expressed, but also the structure of the emotional experience. Emotional responses to the broad topic of climate change were expressed as ongoing analytical judgements, where those related to learning about climate change were immersive and finite.

In this overview, I survey the main lenses through which various actors have linked climate justice and reproductive justice in the United States. First, I review the literatures: on climate justice, the perspective that those who are least responsible for the conditions causing climate change are disproportionately impacted by it; and on the reproductive justice, which focuses on rejecting reproductive oppression to achieve comprehensive reproductive autonomy for individuals and communities. Next, I analyze frameworks that seek to reframe reproductive justice through a populationist, climate‐centered lens. I contrast these framings with new approaches focused on racial health disparities and intergenerational justice. The article ends with questions about the next directions in climate justice and reproductive justice linkages: in particular, the role of eco‐anxiety in shaping reproductive futures. In so doing, I argue for approaches that challenge mainstream framings focused on population size and growth, and instead foreground the embodied reproductive outcomes of climate‐impacted communities.This article is categorized under:\\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.860'}, {'id': 489, 'title': 'Editorial Board', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1674-9278(23)00080-1'}, {'id': 490, 'title': 'How we can create the global agreement on generative AI bias: lessons from climate justice', 'authors': 'Yong Jin Park', 'published': '2023-4-28', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01679-0'}, {'id': 491, 'title': 'Climate Change Impacts on the Availability of Anti-malarial Plants in Kenya', 'authors': 'Dikko Jeff Gafna, Joy A.

The primary objective is to enhance the heat resistance capabilities of materials crucial for geothermal energy extraction, a key renewable energy source with minimal carbon footprint. Presently, Iceland leads in global geothermal energy production, emphasizing the significance of optimizing extraction methods. Previous research faced challenges due to suboptimal material selection, hindering drilling to greater depths. This study proposes a novel solution—employing innovative material coatings on drilling bits and pipes, utilizing metallic compounds with exceptional heat resistance properties. The coating strategy involves leaving pipes uncoated up to a depth where they naturally withstand heat, with subsequent application for greater depths. This approach promises cost-effective materials capable of enduring extreme conditions in geothermal drilling, fostering higher drilling depths and cost efficiency. Implementation projections suggest significant facilitation of geothermal energy extraction, particularly in abandoned wells near tectonic plate boundaries, reducing extraction costs. The study underscores the societal benefits of tapping into indigenous renewable energy sources, emphasizing the minimal carbon footprint of geothermal energy. The proposed material-coating approach aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and presents a strategic decision-making endeavor for corporations to contribute to environmental sustainability.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2523/iptc-24189-ms'}, {'id': 493, 'title': 'Erratum to \"Patients value climate change counseling provided by their pediatrician: The experience in one Wisconsin pediatric clinic\" [J.

This will happen not only as a direct consequence of climate change, but also because of policies for mitigating it—for example, through the installation of large wind and solar farms, the conservation of land in its role as carbon sink, and the extraction of materials needed for renewable energy technologies. In this article, we offer an overview of the justice‐related issues that these impacts create. The literature on climate justice and territory is vast and spans a range of disciplines, so we limit our discussion to a specific understanding of territory and a specific understanding of injustice that arises from its loss. We understand territory as a normative concept that describes a place under some agent's jurisdiction, where the agent is a politically organized collective and where the jurisdictional rights over that place secure a relevant degree of self‐determination for that collective. Accordingly, we consider that the main injustice connected to the loss of territory due to climate change is the loss or undermining of the ability to exercise the collective right to self‐determination, which requires some control over the place. This can happen if a territorial agent literally loses the ground where to stand as a direct effect of climate change, raising issues of justice in relocation; or if their place changes due to mitigation policies, affecting their use and understanding of territory, raising issues of justice in energy transition. In concluding, we point to topics for future research.This article is categorized under:\\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\\nPolicy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in Communities, Cities, and Regions\\n\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wcc.870'}, {'id': 500, 'title': 'Implications of climate change mitigation and socioeconomic development on the U.S. electric power sector', 'authors': 'Fatemeh Ganji, Lu Liu, Shanna Fellows', 'published': '2024-12', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egycc.2024.100125'}, {'id': 701, 'title': 'Transforming Healthcare: The Integration of AI and Digital Technologies', 'authors': 'Kamel N', 'published': '2024', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'This article discusses the integration of digital technologies, including AI and robotic systems, on the health profession globally, and how profession can adapt to the changing landscape of healthcare.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.53902/tnhcr.2024.04.000534'}, {'id': 702, 'title': 'Digital loneliness—changes of social recognition through AI companions', 'authors': 'Kerrin Artemis Jacobs', 'published': '2024-3-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"Inherent to the experience of loneliness is a significant change of meaningful relatedness that (usually negatively) affects a person's relationship to self and others. This paper goes beyond a purely subjective-phenomenological description of individual suffering by emphasizing loneliness as a symptomatic expression of distortions of social recognition relations. Where there is loneliness, a recognition relation has changed. Most societies face an increase in loneliness among all groups of their population, and this sheds light on the reproduction conditions of social integration and inclusion. These functions are essential lifeworldly components of social cohesion and wellbeing. This study asks whether “social” AI promotes these societal success goals of social integration of lonely people. The increasing tendency to regard AI Companions (AICs) as reproducers of adequate recognition is critically discussed with this review.

Two distinct semantic segmentation models were constructed for each group. They were manually labeled by general dentists for semantic segmentation. The inter-examiner reliability of the two examiners was also measured. Finally, the models were trained using transfer learning methodology along with computer science advanced tools, such as ensemble U-Nets with ResNet50, ResNext101, and Vgg19 as the encoders, which were all pretrained on ImageNet weights using a training dataset. Results Intersection over union (IoU) score was used to evaluate the outcomes of the deep learning model. For the adult dataset, the IoU averaged 98%, 23%, 19%, and 51% for zero, primary, moderate, and advanced carious lesions, respectively.

Powered by big data, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, they offer the potential to expand capabilities, improve productivity and provide guidance and support in various domains. Human–Artificial Intelligence (HAI) is proposed to help with the integration of human values, empathy and ethical considerations into AI in order to address the limitations of AI chatbots and enhance their effectiveness. Mental health is a critical global concern, with a substantial impact on individuals, communities and economies. Digital mental health solutions, leveraging AI and ML, have emerged to address the challenges of access, stigma and cost in mental health care. Despite their potential, ethical and legal implications surrounding these technologies remain uncertain. This narrative literature review explores the potential of AI chatbots to revolutionize digital mental health while emphasizing the need for ethical, responsible and trustworthy AI algorithms. The review is guided by three key research questions: the impact of AI chatbots on technology integration, the balance between benefits and harms, and the mitigation of bias and prejudice in AI applications. Methodologically, the review involves extensive database and search engine searches, utilizing keywords related to AI chatbots and digital mental health. Peer-reviewed journal articles and media sources were purposively selected to address the research questions, resulting in a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge on this evolving topic.

Methods This study was conducted from June to December 2021, using an anticipatory ethics approach and sociology of expectations as the theoretical frameworks. It focused mainly on three groups of stakeholders; namely, physicians (n\\u2009=\\u200912), patients (n\\u2009=\\u200915) and healthcare managers (n\\u2009=\\u200911), all of whom are directly related to the adoption of AI in medicine (n\\u2009=\\u200938). Results In this study, interviews were conducted with 40% of the patients in the sample (15/38), as well as 31% of the physicians (12/38) and 29% of health managers in the sample (11/38). The findings highlight the following: (1) the impact of AI on fundamental aspects of the patient–physician relationship and the underlying importance of a synergistic relationship between the physician and AI; (2) the potential for AI to alleviate workload and reduce administrative burden by saving time and putting the patient at the centre of the caring process and (3) the potential risk to the holistic approach by neglecting humanness in healthcare.

Some major concerns include providing inadequate or harmful support, exploiting vulnerable populations, and potentially producing discriminatory advice due to algorithmic bias. However, it is not always obvious for users to fully understand the nature of the relationship they have with chatbots. There can be significant misunderstandings about the exact purpose of the chatbot, particularly in terms of care expectations, ability to adapt to the particularities of users and responsiveness in terms of the needs and resources/treatments that can be offered. Hence, it is imperative that users are aware of the limited therapeutic relationship they can enjoy when interacting with mental health chatbots.

A lack of ethical principles for the use of AI in practice has been highlighted by several stakeholders due to the recent attention given to it. Research has shown an urgent need for more knowledge regarding the ethical implications of AI applications in healthcare. However, fundamental ethical principles may not be sufficient to describe ethical concerns associated with implementing AI applications. Objective The aim of this study is twofold, (1) to use the implementation of AI applications to predict patient mortality in emergency departments as a setting to explore healthcare professionals’ perspectives on ethical issues in relation to ethical principles and (2) to develop a model to guide ethical considerations in AI implementation in healthcare based on ethical theory. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants. The abductive approach used to analyze the empirical data consisted of four steps alternating between inductive and deductive analyses. Results Our findings provide an ethical model demonstrating the need to address six ethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, explicability, and professional governance) in relation to ethical theories defined as virtue, deontology, and consequentialism when AI applications are to be implemented in clinical practice. Conclusions Ethical aspects of AI applications are broader than the prima facie principles of medical ethics and the principle of explicability. Ethical aspects thus need to be viewed from a broader perspective to cover different situations that healthcare professionals, in general, and physicians, in particular, may face when using AI applications in clinical practice.

In the study, we trained three distinct deep learning models, and we utilized majority voting to evaluate their outcomes, aiming to yield the most reliable and precise diagnoses of hip fractures from X-ray radiographs. Methods An initial study was conducted of 10,849 AP pelvis X-rays obtained from five hospitals affiliated with Başkent University. Two expert orthopedic surgeons initially labeled 2,291 radiographs as fractures and 8,558 as non-fractures. The algorithm was trained on 6,943 (64%) radiographs, validated on 1,736 (16%) radiographs, and tested on 2,170 (20%) radiographs, ensuring an even distribution of fracture presence, age, and gender. We employed three advanced deep learning architectures, Xception (Model A), EfficientNet (Model B), and NfNet (Model C), with a final decision aggregated through a majority voting technique (Model D). Results For each model, we achieved the following metrics: For Model A: F1 Score 0.895, Accuracy 0.956, Specificity 0.973, Sensitivity 0.893. For Model B: F1 Score 0.900, Accuracy 0.960, Specificity 0.991, Sensitivity 0.845. For Model C: F1 Score 0.919, Accuracy 0.966, Specificity 0.984, Sensitivity 0.899. For Model D: F1 Score 0.929, Accuracy 0.971, Specificity 0.991, Sensitivity 0.897. We concluded that Model D (majority voting) achieved the best results in terms of the F1 score, accuracy, and specificity values. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the results obtained by aggregating the decisions of multiple models through voting, rather than relying solely on the decision of a single algorithm, are more consistent. The practical application of these algorithms will be difficult due to ethical, legal, and confidentiality issues, despite the theoretical success achieved. Developing successful algorithms and methodologies should not be viewed as the ultimate goal; it is important to understand how these algorithms will be used in real-life situations. In order to achieve more consistent results, feedback from clinical practice will be helpful.

Objective This article investigates how the PMHnet algorithm – an AI prognostication tool developed in Denmark to predict the one-year all-cause mortality risk for patients hospitalized with ischemic heart disease – was presented to cardiologists working in the hospital setting, and how they responded to this novel decision-support tool. Methods Empirically, we draw upon ethnographic fieldwork in the Danish-led international research project, PM Heart, which since 2019 has developed the PMHnet algorithm and implemented the software into the electronic health record system in hospitals in Eastern Denmark (the Capital Region and Region Zealand). Results Paying careful attention to the hopes and concerns of cardiologists who will have to embrace and adapt to algorithmic tools in their everyday work of diagnosing and treating patients, we identify three analytical themes meriting attention when AI is implemented in healthcare: 1) the re-negotiation of agency and autonomy in human-algorithm relations, 2) accountability in algorithmic prognostication and 3) the complex relationship between association and causation actualized by predictive algorithms. From these analytical themes, we elicit methodological questions to guide future ethnographic explorations of how AI and advanced algorithms are put to use in the healthcare system, with what implications, and for whom. Conclusion We conclude that local, qualitative investigations of how algorithms are used, embraced and contested in everyday clinical practice are needed in order to understand their implications – good and bad, intended and unintended – for clinicians, patients and healthcare provision.

Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of actively supporting patients in their long-term treatment. In order to effectively assist patients, it is crucial to understand their current needs by taking a look at the patients' opinions.ObjectiveThis study focuses specifically on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and aims to determine if the current patient engagement offerings from pharmaceutical companies adequately address the needs of CML patients. To achieve this, the study uses content generated by CML patients to assess the patient engagement strategies of selected pharmaceutical companies, explore the relevance of medication, their products, and services, and analyze key concerns from the perspective of the patients.MethodsTo address the research questions, various methodologies were employed. Initially, desk research was conducted to identify relevant pharmaceutical companies and internet forums related to CML. Subsequently, content generated by patients was acquired and AI-driven techniques such as topic modeling and topic evolution analyses were used to examine this user-generated content (UGC) within the identified public forums. This involved analyzing topic models and tracking topic changes over time.ResultsThe desk research revealed that pharmaceutical companies primarily offer information about the disease and available treatment options. The UGC analysis confirmed the significant role played by the industry in supporting CML patients. Key areas of interest for patients include the disease itself, potential treatment methods and associated side effects, dosage of active substances, and the possibility of switching therapies due to treatment failure or resistance. Stem cell transplantation was also discussed.ConclusionsOverall, the pharmaceutical industry adequately addresses the needs of CML patients. However, there is room for improvement in educating patients about treatment options, drugs, and their side effects. Psychological support should not be neglected. Since CML patients frequently engage with clinical trial outcomes, there is potential for increased patient involvement in such trials. Further research in this area is recommended.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1243215'}, {'id': 737, 'title': 'Improving Accessibility and Readability of Survey Reports in Digital Health Platforms using Conversational AI', 'authors': 'Pooya Moradian Zadeh, Deborah Sattler', 'published': '2023-12-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bibm58861.2023.10386018'}, {'id': 738, 'title': 'AI-ASSISTED SHORT-TERM FORECASTING OF IMPENDING ATRIAL FIBRILLATION EPISODES USING A WEARABLE ECG PATCH', 'authors': 'Soonil Kwon, Jangwon Suh, Jungmin Ko, Hyo-Jeong Ahn, So-Ryoung Lee, Wonjong Rhee, Eue-Keun Choi, Seil Oh', 'published': '2023-10', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cvdhj.2023.08.012'}, {'id': 739, 'title': 'Explainable artificial intelligence for mental health through transparency and interpretability for understandability', 'authors': 'Dan W.

In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term “explainability” in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to “ground” in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other—as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-023-00751-9'}, {'id': 740, 'title': 'The role of uncertainty and affect in decision-making on the adoption of AI-based contact-tracing technology during the COVID-19 pandemic', 'authors': 'Soo Jung Hong, Hichang Cho', 'published': '2023-1', 'citations': 4, 'abstract': \"ObjectiveThis study explores how negative affect, perceived net equity, and uncertainty influence the public's privacy decision-making regarding the adoption of contact-tracing technology based on artificial intelligence (AI) during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsFour hundred and eighteen adults in the US participated in the study via Amazon Mechanical Turk in August 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro. Indirect effects and their significance were estimated using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) with resampling set to n\\u2009=\\u20095000.ResultsPerceived net equity was positively associated with low levels of perceived uncertainty regarding a COVID-19 contact-tracing application and intention to adopt it. Low levels of perceived uncertainty were positively associated with intentions to adopt such an application, thereby suggesting that a perceived level of uncertainty mediates the association between perceived net equity and adoption intentions. Anxieties regarding AI technology and COVID-19 risks both moderate the associations among perceived net equity, perceived level of uncertainty, and intentions to adopt the contact-tracing technology.ConclusionsOur findings highlight how the differing sources of emotion influence the associations among rational judgment, perceptions, and decision-making about new contact-tracing technology.

Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment.

Accurate skin permeability prediction is crucial for successful transdermal drug delivery (TDD). In this study, we address this critical need to enhance TDD. A dataset comprising 441 records for 140 molecules with diverse LogKp values was characterized. The descriptor calculation yielded 145 relevant descriptors. Machine learning models, including MLR, RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, LGBM, and ANN, were employed for regression analysis. Notably, LGBM, XGBoost, and gradient boosting models outperformed others, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Key descriptors influencing skin permeability, such as hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and topological polar surface area, were identified and visualized. Cluster analysis applied to the FDA-approved drug dataset (2326 compounds) revealed four distinct clusters with significant differences in molecular characteristics. Predicted LogKp values for these clusters offered insights into the permeability variations among FDA-approved drugs. Furthermore, an investigation into skin permeability patterns across 83 classes of FDA-approved drugs based on the ATC code showcased significant differences, providing valuable information for drug development strategies. The study underscores the importance of accurate skin permeability prediction for TDD, emphasizing the superior performance of nonlinear machine learning models. The identified key descriptors and clusters contribute to a nuanced understanding of permeability characteristics among FDA-approved drugs.

The objective of this study was to explore NHS health practitioners' perspectives and attitudes towards the future use of AI-supported technologies in ED triage.MethodsBetween July and August 2022 a qualitative-exploratory research study was conducted to collect and capture the perceptions and attitudes of nine NHS healthcare practitioners to better understand the challenges and benefits of a DAISY deployment. The study was based on a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. The study involved qualitative data analysis of the interviewees' responses. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, and notes included into data documents. The transcripts were coded line-by-line, and data were organised into themes and sub-themes. Both inductive and deductive approaches to thematic analysis were used to analyse such data.ResultsBased on a qualitative analysis of coded interviews with the practitioners, responses were categorised into broad main thematic-types, namely: trust; current practice; social, legal, ethical, and cultural concerns; and empathetic practice. Sub-themes were identified for each main theme. Further quantitative analyses explored the vocabulary and sentiments of the participants when talking generally about NHS ED practices compared to discussing DAISY. Limitations include a small sample size and the requirement that research participants imagine a prototype AI-supported system still under development. The expectation is that such a system would work alongside the practitioner. Findings can be generalisable to other healthcare AI-supported systems and to other domains.DiscussionThis study highlights the benefits and challenges for an AI-supported triage healthcare solution. The study shows that most NHS ED practitioners interviewed were positive about such adoption. Benefits cited were a reduction in patient wait times in the ED, assistance in the streamlining of the triage process, support in calling for appropriate diagnostics and for further patient examination, and identification of those very unwell and requiring more immediate and urgent attention. Words used to describe the system were that DAISY is a “good idea”, “help”, helpful, “easier”, “value”, and “accurate”. Our study demonstrates that trust in the system is a significant driver of use and a potential barrier to adoption. Participants emphasised social, legal, ethical, and cultural considerations and barriers to DAISY adoption and the importance of empathy and non-verbal cues in patient interactions. Findings demonstrate how DAISY might support and augment human medical performance in ED care, and provide an understanding of attitudinal barriers and considerations for the development and implementation of future triage AI-supported systems.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1297073'}, {'id': 747, 'title': 'Implementing AI-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis for Radiological Detection of Tuberculosis: A Multi-Stage Health Technology Assessment', 'authors': 'David Hua, Neysa Petrina, Noel Young, Jin-Gun Cho, Simon K.

This paper aims to examine the impact of online learning on digital engagement and digital-related health symptoms among university students one year into the coronavirus pandemic. Methods: Data was collected through a self-administered online questionnaire after ethical approval. The questionnaire was adapted from the previously published Lifestyle Study in Youth Questionnaire. Through the questionnaire, the perception of students toward online learning was probed and recorded. Digital engagement and digital-related health symptoms were compared before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: The majority (97.5%) of respondents preferred face-to-face learning. The time spent on digital devices was 1.8 times higher during COVID-19 than before the COVID-19 lockdown (t-test = -18.86, p<0.0001). The total hours of sleep were reduced during COVID-19 lockdown (0.6 hours lesser) (t-test = -3.92, p<0.0001).

This study proposes a comprehensive framework, named Lung-DT, which leverages IoT sensors and AI algorithms to establish the digital representation of a patient’s respiratory health. Using the YOLOv8 neural network, the Lung-DT system accurately classifies chest X-rays into five distinct categories of lung diseases, including “normal”, “covid”, “lung_opacity”, “pneumonia”, and “tuberculosis”. The performance of the system was evaluated employing a chest X-ray dataset available in the literature, demonstrating average accuracy of 96.8%, precision of 92%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 94%. The proposed Lung-DT framework offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods. Firstly, it enables real-time monitoring of lung health through continuous data acquisition from IoT sensors, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Secondly, the AI-powered classification module provides automated and objective assessments of chest X-rays, reducing dependence on subjective human interpretation. Thirdly, the twin digital representation of the patient’s respiratory health allows for comprehensive analysis and correlation of multiple data streams, providing valuable insights as to personalized treatment plans. The integration of IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and DT technology within the Lung-DT system demonstrates a significant step towards improving thoracic healthcare. By enabling continuous monitoring, automated diagnosis, and comprehensive data analysis, the Lung-DT framework has enormous potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource allocation.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s24030958'}, {'id': 751, 'title': 'The Integration of AI in Mental Health Assessment: Leveraging Digital', 'authors': 'Maren M.

Modern historians of science Duston L. and Galison P. in their book on the history of scientific objectivity, they talk about the alternation of \"epistemic virtues\", as one of which objectivity has been established since a certain moment. At the same time, the promotion of one or another virtue regulating the scientific self, i.e. acting as a normative principle for a scientist when choosing one or another way of seeing and one or another scientific practice, depends on making decisions in difficult cases requiring the will and limitation of the self. In this sense, epistemology is combined with ethics: a scientist, guided by certain moral principles, gives preference to one or another way of behavior, choosing, for example, not a more accurate hand-drawn image, but an uncluttered photograph, perhaps fuzzy, but obtained mechanically, which means more objective and free from any admixture of subjectivity. In this regard, the epistemic status of modern AI-based technologies, which increasingly assume the functions of the scientific self, including in terms of influencing final decision-making and obtaining objective knowledge, seems interesting. For example, in the field of medicine, robotic devices already provide significant support, taking over some of the functions, for example, of a first-level doctor to collect and analyze standardized patient data and diagnostics. There is an assumption that AI will take on more and more responsibilities in the near future: data processing, development of new drugs and treatment methods, establishing remote interaction with the patient, etc. But does this mean that the scientific self can be replaced by AI-based algorithms, and another epistemic virtue will replace objectivity, finally breaking the link between ethics and epistemology – this question needs to be investigated.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.17816/dd625319'}, {'id': 759, 'title': 'The Gap Between AI and Bedside: Participatory Workshop on the Barriers to the Integration, Translation, and Adoption of Digital Health Care and AI Startup Technology Into Clinical Practice', 'authors': 'Iredia M Olaye, Azizi A Seixas', 'published': '2023-5-2', 'citations': 4, 'abstract': \"\\nBackground\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and digital health technological innovations from startup companies used in clinical practice can yield better health outcomes, reduce health care costs, and improve patients' experience.

The assemblage of this article combines freshly located research literature, directly and indirectly related to a story’s themes, and/or the personality type of protagonists. Importantly, this assemblage also utilizes text analysis software revealing the relatively invisible (e.g. (in)frequent words, parts of speech, and topics) and Large Language Model (LLM) Generative AI to enrich the interpretation. The use of all these elements helps productively exceed initial intuitions about the story, facilitating creativity. I model the approach using Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, The Black Cat, whose protagonist is a homicidal psychopath. Specifically, the assemblage here includes relevant software-based research (a corpus analysis of homicidal psychopathic language), non-software-based research (psychoanalytical literary criticism of The Black Cat using the empirically validated concept of transference), text analysis software (WMatrix and Datayze), and the LLM Generative AI, ‘ChatGPT’ (using the freely available LLM GPT-3.5). One use of this approach is as a pedagogy in Literary Studies employing text analysis software (e.g. on a digital stylistics course).

With many suffering from opioid use disorder first having encountered opioids via prescription routes, practitioners and health systems have an enduring need to identify and effectively respond to the problematic use of opioid prescription. There are strong challenges to successfully addressing this need: importantly, the patterns of prescription fulfillment that signal opioid abuse can be subtle and difficult to recognize, and overzealous enforcement can deprive those with legitimate pain management needs the appropriate care. Moreover, injudicious responses risk shifting those suffering from early-stage abuse of prescribed opioids to illicitly sourced street alternatives, whose varying dosage, availability, and the risk of adulteration can pose grave health risks.MethodsThis study employs a dynamic modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription regimes employing machine learning monitoring programs to identify the patients who are at risk of opioid abuse while being treated with prescribed opioids. To this end, an agent-based model was developed and implemented to examine the effect of reduced prescribing and prescription drug monitoring programs on overdose and escalation to street opioids among patients, and on the legitimacy of fulfillments of opioid prescriptions over a 5-year time horizon. A study released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information was used to estimate the parameter values and assist in the validation of the existing agent-based model.Results and discussionThe model estimates that lowering the prescription doses exerted the most favorable impact on the outcomes of interest over 5 years with a minimum burden on patients with a legitimate need for pharmaceutical opioids. The accurate conclusion about the impact of public health interventions requires a comprehensive set of outcomes to test their multi-dimensional effects, as utilized in this research.

This research will be used in a PAMS optimization process to improve PAMS personalization by incorporating engagement prediction and digital phenotyping. This study aims (1) to prove the feasibility of using dDPP user-collected data to build an ML model that predicts engagement and contributes to identifying digital engagement phenotypes, (2) to describe methods for developing ML models with dDPP data sets and present preliminary results, and (3) to present preliminary data on user profiling based on ML model outputs.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nUsing the gradient-boosted forest model, we predicted engagement in 4 dDPP individual activities (physical activity, lessons, social activity, and weigh-ins) and general activity (engagement in any activity) based on previous short- and long-term activity in the app. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the precision-recall curve, and the Brier score metrics determined the performance of the model. Shapley values reflected the feature importance of the models and determined what variables informed user profiling through latent profile analysis.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nWe developed 2 models using weekly and daily DPP data sets (328,821 and 704,242 records, respectively), which yielded predictive accuracies above 90%. Although both models were highly accurate, the daily model better fitted our research plan because it predicted daily changes in individual activities, which was crucial for creating the “digital phenotypes.” To better understand the variables contributing to the model predictor, we calculated the Shapley values for both models to identify the features with the highest contribution to model fit; engagement with any activity in the dDPP in the last 7 days had the most predictive power. We profiled users with latent profile analysis after 2 weeks of engagement (Bayesian information criterion=−3222.46) with the dDPP and identified 6 profiles of users, including those with high engagement, minimal engagement, and attrition.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\nPreliminary results demonstrate that applying ML methods with predicting power is an acceptable mechanism to tailor and optimize messaging interventions to support patient engagement and adherence to digital prescriptions. The results enable future optimization of our existing messaging platform and expansion of this methodology to other clinical domains.\\n\\n\\nTrial Registration\\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04773834; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04773834\\n\\n\\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\\nRR2-10.2196/26750\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/47122'}, {'id': 776, 'title': 'Large language models: a new chapter in digital health', 'authors': ' The Lancet Digital Health', 'published': '2024-1', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2589-7500(23)00254-6'}, {'id': 777, 'title': 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Digital Health and Medical Analytics', 'authors': 'Uthayasankar Sivarajah, Yichuan Wang, Hossein Olya, Sherin Mathew', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 4, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-023-10412-7'}, {'id': 778, 'title': 'Types of Digital Mindfulness: Improving Mental Health Among College Students – A Scoping Review', 'authors': 'Iyus Yosep, Suryani Suryani, Henny Mediani, Ai Mardhiyah, Kusman Ibrahim', 'published': '2024-1', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s443781'}, {'id': 779, 'title': 'Decolonising health data', 'authors': ' The Lancet Digital Health', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2589-7500(23)00132-2'}, {'id': 780, 'title': 'Music in the digital age: commodity, community, communion', 'authors': 'Ian Cross', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'AbstractDigital systems are reshaping how we engage with music as a sounding dimension of cultural life that is capable of being transformed into a commodity. At the same time, as we increasingly engage through digital media with each other and with virtual others, attributes of music that underpin our capacity to interact communicatively are disregarded or overlooked within those media. Even before the advent of technologies of music reproduction, music was susceptible to assimilation into economic acts of exchange. What is new in the digital world is the way in which modes of engagement with music are themselves being absorbed into an economy built on the datafication of virtual acts and the digital shadows of casual preferences. But music is more than just sounds that are culturally sanctioned as musical. Music is manifested as behaviours, and in interactive behaviour. Music is participatory as well as presentational, and in the participatory mode—involving collective, non-specialist, interactive real-time music-making—has significant individual and social consequences. Yet music as real-time participation is largely absent from the virtual world, with potential social costs that remain to be understood. Moreover, our everyday, face-to-face communicative—conversational—interactions are imbued with patterns between interlocutors that are musical, in that they share features with what we are happy to describe as “music”. These features are presently lacking in digital systems designed to subserve communicative functions, and this paper will consider the significant implications for our interactions with machines to which their successful incorporation into voice–user interfaces would give rise.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01670-9'}, {'id': 781, 'title': 'Diverse patients’ attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) in diagnosis', 'authors': 'Christopher Robertson, Andrew Woods, Kelly Bergstrand, Jess Findley, Cayley Balser, Marvin J.

Yet people are often reluctant to trust automated systems, and some patient populations may be particularly distrusting. We sought to determine how diverse patient populations feel about the use of AI diagnostic tools, and whether framing and informing the choice affects uptake. To construct and pretest our materials, we conducted structured interviews with a diverse set of actual patients. We then conducted a pre-registered (osf.io/9y26x), randomized, blinded survey experiment in factorial design. A survey firm provided n = 2675 responses, oversampling minoritized populations. Clinical vignettes were randomly manipulated in eight variables with two levels each: disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea), whether AI is proven more accurate than human specialists, whether the AI clinic is personalized to the patient through listening and/or tailoring, whether the AI clinic avoids racial and/or financial biases, whether the Primary Care Physician (PCP) promises to explain and incorporate the advice, and whether the PCP nudges the patient towards AI as the established, recommended, and easy choice. Our main outcome measure was selection of AI clinic or human physician specialist clinic (binary, “AI uptake”). We found that with weighting representative to the U.S. population, respondents were almost evenly split (52.9% chose human doctor and 47.1% chose AI clinic). In unweighted experimental contrasts of respondents who met pre-registered criteria for engagement, a PCP’s explanation that AI has proven superior accuracy increased uptake (OR = 1.48, CI 1.24–1.77, p < .001), as did a PCP’s nudge towards AI as the established choice (OR = 1.25, CI: 1.05–1.50, p = .013), as did reassurance that the AI clinic had trained counselors to listen to the patient’s unique perspectives (OR = 1.27, CI: 1.07–1.52, p = .008). Disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea) and other manipulations did not affect AI uptake significantly. Compared to White respondents, Black respondents selected AI less often (OR = .73, CI: .55-.96, p = .023) and Native Americans selected it more often (OR: 1.37, CI: 1.01–1.87, p = .041). Older respondents were less likely to choose AI (OR: .99, CI: .987-.999, p = .03), as were those who identified as politically conservative (OR: .65, CI: .52-.81, p < .001) or viewed religion as important (OR: .64, CI: .52-.77, p < .001). For each unit increase in education, the odds are 1.10 greater for selecting an AI provider (OR: 1.10, CI: 1.03–1.18, p = .004). While many patients appear resistant to the use of AI, accuracy information, nudges and a listening patient experience may help increase acceptance. To ensure that the benefits of AI are secured in clinical practice, future research on best methods of physician incorporation and patient decision making is required.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000237'}, {'id': 782, 'title': 'The Environmental Impacts of AI and Digital Technologies', 'authors': 'Sepehr Khajeh Naeeni, Nilofar Nouhi', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"This study aims to investigate the environmental impacts of AI and digital technologies, identify potential mitigation strategies, and assess the role of policy, regulation, and public awareness in fostering sustainable practices within this domain. Employing a qualitative research methodology, this study collected data through semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals across the technology sector, environmental research, policy-making, and academia. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview transcripts, allowing for the identification of main themes and categories related to the environmental impacts of AI and digital technologies and the exploration of potential mitigation strategies. Five main themes emerged from the analysis: Direct Environmental Impact, Mitigation Strategies, Technological Innovations, Policy and Regulation, and Public Awareness and Engagement. Each theme encompasses various categories and concepts, such as Energy Consumption, E-Waste, Renewable Energy Adoption, Sustainable Design, Energy-Efficient Hardware, Legislation and Standards, Educational Campaigns, and Digital Literacy. The findings highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of AI and digital technologies' environmental impacts, along with the crucial role of innovative mitigation strategies and comprehensive policy frameworks in addressing these challenges. The study concludes that while AI and digital technologies offer tremendous potential for advancing sustainable development, their deployment must be carefully managed to minimize negative environmental impacts. It underscores the importance of integrating sustainability considerations into the development and deployment of these technologies, alongside fostering robust policy and regulatory frameworks and enhancing public awareness and engagement to achieve a sustainable digital future.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.61838/kman.aitech.1.4.3'}, {'id': 783, 'title': 'Explainable AI (XAI) for AI-Acceptability: The Coming Age of Digital Management 5.0', 'authors': 'Samia Chehbi Gamoura', 'published': '2023-10-25', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icnsc58704.2023.10319030'}, {'id': 784, 'title': 'The clinician-AI interface: intended use and explainability in FDA-cleared AI devices for medical image interpretation', 'authors': 'Stephanie L.

An underappreciated aspect of this clinical translation is where the AI fits into the clinical workflow, and in turn, the outputs generated by the AI to facilitate clinician interaction in this workflow. For instance, in the canonical use case of AI for medical image interpretation, the AI could prioritize cases before clinician review or even autonomously interpret the images without clinician review. A related aspect is explainability – does the AI generate outputs to help explain its predictions to clinicians? While many clinical AI workflows and explainability techniques have been proposed, a summative assessment of the current scope in clinical practice is lacking. Here, we evaluate the current state of FDA-cleared AI devices for medical image interpretation assistance in terms of intended clinical use, outputs generated, and types of explainability offered. We create a curated database focused on these aspects of the clinician-AI interface, where we find a high frequency of “triage” devices, notable variability in output characteristics across products, and often limited explainability of AI predictions. Altogether, we aim to increase transparency of the current landscape of the clinician-AI interface and highlight the need to rigorously assess which strategies ultimately lead to the best clinical outcomes.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41746-024-01080-1'}, {'id': 785, 'title': 'MT46 Implementation of Cost-Consequences Analysis As an Economic Evaluation Method for Artificial Intelligent (AI) Medical and Digital Technologies. the Case of Hosmartai (HORIZON 2020 FUNDED)', 'authors': 'M.

The results from a survey support the notion that compensatory mechanisms and the need to belong play important roles in affecting usage intentions of AI-based virtual influencers. Specifically, the study finds that usage intentions are mediated and moderated by compensatory mechanisms that arise from the perception of AI-based virtual influencers’ functional benefits and existential threats to human identity. Furthermore, the need for belonging moderates the effects of the following status (following versus non-following) on perceived personalization benefits of AI-based virtual influencers and behavioral intentions to use AI-based virtual influencers.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize feedback from listening sessions conducted by the AIM-AHEAD Coordinating Center in February 2022, titled the “AIM-AHEAD Community Building Convention (ACBC).” A total of six listening sessions were held over three days. A total of 977 people registered with AIM-AHEAD to attend ACBC and 557 individuals attended the listening sessions across stakeholder groups. Facilitators led the conversation based on a series of guiding questions, and responses were captured through voice and chat via the Slido platform. A professional third-party provider transcribed the audio. Qualitative analysis included data from transcripts and chat logs. Thematic analysis was then used to identify common and unique themes across all transcripts. Six main themes arose from the sessions. Attendees felt that storytelling would be a powerful tool in communicating the impact of AI/ML in promoting health equity, trust building is vital and can be fostered through existing trusted relationships, and diverse communities should be involved every step of the way. Attendees shared a wealth of information that will guide AIM-AHEAD’s future activities. The sessions highlighted the need for researchers to translate AI/ML concepts into vignettes that are digestible to the larger public, the importance of diversity, and how open-science platforms can be used to encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration. While the sessions confirmed some of the existing barriers in applying AI/ML for health equity, they also offered new insights that were captured in the six themes.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000288'}, {'id': 789, 'title': 'Wearable health data privacy', 'authors': ' The Lancet Digital Health', 'published': '2023-4', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2589-7500(23)00055-9'}, {'id': 790, 'title': 'Mask R-CNN based multiclass segmentation model for endotracheal intubation using video laryngoscope', 'authors': 'Seung Jae Choi, Dae Kon Kim, Byeong Soo Kim, Minwoo Cho, Joo Jeong, You Hwan Jo, Kyoung Jun Song, Yu Jin Kim, Sungwan Kim', 'published': '2023-1', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': \"Objective Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is critical to secure the airway in emergent situations. Although artificial intelligence algorithms are frequently used to analyze medical images, their application to evaluating intraoral structures based on images captured during emergent ETI remains limited.

Methods From 54 VL videos, clinicians manually labeled images that include motion blur, foggy vision, blood, mucus, and vomitus. Anatomical structures of interest included the tongue, epiglottis, vocal cord, and corniculate cartilage. EfficientNet-B5 with DeepLabv3+, EffecientNet-B5 with U-Net, and Configured Mask R-Convolution Neural Network (CNN) were used; EffecientNet-B5 was pretrained on ImageNet. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to measure the segmentation performance of the model. Accuracy, recall, specificity, and F1 score were used to evaluate the model's performance in targeting the structure from the value of the intersection over union between the ground truth and prediction mask.

Particularly, the scaled adoption of virtual care catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up new frontiers in how digital tools can be incorporated into psychiatry. No area of mental health care is as ripe for digital innovation as psychogeriatrics. In this session, an international group of clinicians and researchers will demonstrate how digital health in psychogeriatrics represents multiple cutting edges of innovation.Our symposium will include 4 presentations, that represent original research from the USA, Ecuador, Norway, Kosovo and Australia. We will highlight clinical applications of these digital tools and aligned issues such as improved care access in low- and middle-income countries, the ethics of digital data collection and the potential for creating new liabilities.We will focus on four distinct technologies and applications. Dr. Ipsit Vahia will discuss passive environmental sensing supported by signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) in guiding treatment decision making, especially in dementia care. His presentation will include discussions on how AI can be incorporated into care while also preserving autonomy. Dr. Kreshnik Hoti will discuss the application of AI on voice-based signals to determine changes in pain levels and psychopathology. His presentation will include research conducted in collaboration between teams based in Australia and Kosovo and through a public-private partnership with a digital health startup. Dr. Ana Trueba will focus on digital interventions, specifically virtual reality (VR). She will present data from two studies, one from McLean hospital In the US, and the other from Ecuador that explore how VR can deliver evidence-based non-pharmacologic interventions. Dr. Bettina Husebø will present data from a project she oversees in Norway. Her talk will discuss how care in nursing homes can be improved by incorporating a range of digital approaches into nursing home care paradigms. A particular focus will be on the relationship between pain and behavior symptoms and dementia among nursing home dwelling older adults.Thus, the symposium will address diagnostics, treatment and systems level care and how New technologies are shaping the evolution of psychogeriatrics worldwide.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s104161022300203x'}, {'id': 792, 'title': 'Informing antimicrobial stewardship with explainable AI', 'authors': 'Massimo Cavallaro, Ed Moran, Benjamin Collyer, Noel D.

We considered a data set of hospital admissions linked to records of antibiotic prescriptions and susceptibilities of bacterial isolates. An appropriately trained gradient boosted decision tree algorithm, supplemented by a Shapley explanation model, predicts the likely antimicrobial drug resistance, with the odds of resistance informed by characteristics of the patient, admission data, and historical drug treatments and culture test results. Applying this AI-based system, we found that it substantially reduces the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the observed prescriptions.

The objective of this process is to facilitate comprehension of complex argumentative discourse by finding the related arguments. The APE comprises two stages: argument mining and argument matching. Researchers typically employ sequence labeling models for mining arguments and text matching models to calculate the relationships between them, thereby generating argument pairs. However, these approaches fail to capture long-distance contextual information and struggle to fully comprehend the complex structure of arguments. In our work, we propose the context-aware heterogeneous graph matching (HGMN) model for the APE task. First, we design a graph schema specifically tailored to argumentative texts, along with a heterogeneous graph attention network that effectively captures context information and structural information of arguments. Moreover, the text matching between arguments is converted into a graph matching paradigm and a multi-granularity graph matching model is proposed to handle the intricate relationships between arguments at various levels of granularity. In this way, the semantics of argument are modeled structurally and thus capture the complicated correlations between arguments. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the HGMN model, including comparisons with existing methods and the GPT series of large language models (LLM). The results demonstrate that HGMN outperforms the state-of-the-art method.\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-09250-0'}, {'id': 2370, 'title': 'When Should We Report the Traffic Jams of Today?

Our framework receives a graph as input and passes it to the GNN to be investigated, which returns suitable node embeddings. These are used to derive insights on the behavior of the GNN through the application of (Social) Network Analysis theory and techniques. The insights thus obtained are employed to define a new training loss function, which takes into account the differences between the graph received as input by the GNN and the one reconstructed from the node embeddings returned by it. This measure is finally used to improve the performance of the GNN. In addition to describe the framework in detail and compare it with related literature, we present an extensive experimental campaign that we conducted to validate the quality of the results obtained.\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-09181-w'}, {'id': 2397, 'title': 'Graph neural networks and implicit neural representation for near-optimal topology prediction over irregular design domains', 'authors': 'Minsik Seo, Seungjae Min', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106284'}, {'id': 2398, 'title': 'LollipopE: Bi-centered lollipop embedding for complex logic query on knowledge graph', 'authors': 'Shiyao Yan, Changyuan Tian, Zequn Zhang, Guangluan Xu', 'published': '2024-7', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2024.106277'}, {'id': 2399, 'title': 'A deep connectome learning network using graph convolution for connectome-disease association study', 'authors': 'Yanwu Yang, Chenfei Ye, Ting Ma', 'published': '2023-7', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.04.025'}, {'id': 2400, 'title': 'Improve Robustness of Graph Neural Networks: Multi-hop Neighbors Meet Homophily-based Truncation Defense', 'authors': 'Yujie Gu, Huiyan Sun, Yansong Wang, Haobo Shi', 'published': '2023-6-18', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ijcnn54540.2023.10191493'}, {'id': 1701, 'title': 'Adaptive selection of local and non-local attention mechanisms for speech enhancement', 'authors': 'Xinmeng Xu, Weiping Tu, Yuhong Yang', 'published': '2024-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2024.106236'}, {'id': 1702, 'title': 'Integrating Multiple Visual Attention Mechanisms in Deep Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Fernando Martinez, Yijun Zhao', 'published': '2023-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/compsac57700.2023.00180'}, {'id': 1703, 'title': 'Novel Hybrid Model Coupling WOA with BiLSTM Neural Networks and Attention Mechanisms', 'authors': 'Liuyu Wang, Huatai Pan, Zhengxian Cai', 'published': '2023-8-11', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icipca59209.2023.10258008'}, {'id': 1704, 'title': 'A study on the application of graph neural network in code clone detection', 'authors': 'Linfeng Dai', 'published': '2023-6-16', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3605801.3605834'}, {'id': 1705, 'title': 'Dual-domain strip attention for image restoration', 'authors': 'Yuning Cui, Alois Knoll', 'published': '2024-3', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.12.003'}, {'id': 1706, 'title': 'Multimodal Biometric Recognition Neural Networks with Branch Attention Mechanisms', 'authors': ' LiuJun, Chen Mingjin,  GuoYong, Huang Zengxi', 'published': '2023-8-18', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/arace60380.2023.00021'}, {'id': 1707, 'title': 'Co-attention enabled content-based image retrieval', 'authors': 'Zechao Hu, Adrian G.

However, due to the influence of environmental and human factors, energy consumption prediction is often inaccurate. Therefore, this paper presents a building energy consumption prediction model based on an attention mechanism, time convolutional neural (TCN) network fusion, and a bidirectional gated cycle unit (BIGRU). First, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE) was used to preprocess the data and extract the key features, and then a BIGRU was employed to acquire past and future data while capturing immediate connections. Then, to catch the long-term dependence, the dataset was partitioned into the TCN network, and the extended sequence was transformed into several short sequences. Consequently, the gradient explosion or vanishing problem is mitigated when the BIGRU handles lengthy sequences while reducing the spatial complexity. Second, the self-attention mechanism was introduced to enhance the model's capability to address data periodicity. The proposed model is superior to the other four models in accuracy, with an mean absolute error of 0.023, an mean-square error of 0.029, and an coefficient of determination of 0.979. Experimental results indicate that T-SNE can significantly improve the model performance, and the accuracy of predictions can be improved by the attention mechanism and the TCN network.</p>\\n\\n\\t

'abstract': 'In the field of behavioral detection, deep learning has been extensively utilized. For example, deep learning models have been utilized to detect and classify malware. Deep learning, however, has vulnerabilities that can be exploited with crafted inputs, resulting in malicious files being misclassified. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) may be compromised by malicious files, which can have catastrophic consequences. This paper presents a method for classifying Windows portable executables (PEs) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To generate malware executable adversarial examples of PE, we conduct two white-box attacks, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) and Carlini and Wagner attack (C&W). An adversarial payload was injected into the DOS header, and a section was added to the file to preserve the PE functionality. The attacks successfully evaded the CNN model with a 91% evasion rate, whereas the RNN model evaded attacks at an 84.6% rate. Two defense mechanisms based on distillation and training techniques are examined in this study for overcoming adversarial example challenges. Distillation and training against JSMA resulted in the highest reductions in the evasion rates of 48.1% and 41.49%, respectively. Distillation and training against C&W resulted in the highest decrease in evasion rates, at 48.1% and 49.9%, respectively.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14041673'}, {'id': 1774, 'title': 'Sparse Attention-based Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting', 'authors': 'Zubo Hu, Huiyuan Jiang', 'published': '2023-4-21', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icsp58490.2023.10248483'}, {'id': 1775, 'title': 'Speech Emotion Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism', 'authors': 'Konstantinos Mountzouris, Isidoros Perikos, Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis', 'published': '2023-10-23', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an interesting and difficult problem to handle.

However, real-world networks often violate such assumptions, having diverse attributes and structural properties. Node mapping across such structurally heterogeneous networks remains a challenge. Although capturing the nodes’ entire neighborhood (in low-dimensional embeddings) may help deal with these characteristic differences, the issue of over-smoothing in the representations that come from higherorder learning still remains a major problem. To address the above concerns, we propose SAlign: a supervised graph neural attention framework for aligning structurally heterogeneous networks that learns the correlation of structural properties of mapping nodes using a set of labeled (mapped) anchor nodes. SAlign incorporates nodes’ graphlet information with a novel structure-aware cross-network attention mechanism that transfers the required higher-order structure information across networks. The information exchanged across networks helps in enhancing the expressivity of the graph neural network, thereby handling any potential over-smoothing problem. Extensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that SAlign consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art network alignment methods by at least 1.3-8% in terms of accuracy score.

To leverage the temporal potential of SNNs, we propose a self-attention-based temporal-channel joint attention SNN (STCA-SNN) with end-to-end training, which infers attention weights along both temporal and channel dimensions concurrently. It models global temporal and channel information correlations with self-attention, enabling the network to learn ‘what’ and ‘when’ to attend simultaneously.

Spectral reflectance values of tomato leaves were captured at wavelengths between 400 and 1100 nm, collected from several treatments after application of normal nitrogen and on the first, second, and third days after application of excess nitrogen. A new method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with an attention mechanism was proposed to perform the estimation of nitrogen overdose in tomato leaves. To verify the effectiveness of this method, the proposed attention mechanism-based CNN classifier was compared with an alternative CNN having the same architecture without integrating the attention mechanism, and with other CNN models, AlexNet and VGGNet. Experimental results showed that the CNN with an attention mechanism outperformed the alternative CNN, achieving a correct classification rate (CCR) of 97.33% for the treatment, compared with a CCR of 94.94% for the CNN alone.

We verify that AttnBM has a tractable likelihood function and gradient for certain special cases and is easy to train. Moreover, we reveal the hidden connections between AttnBM and some single-layer models, namely the gaussian–Bernoulli restricted BM and the denoising autoencoder with softmax units coming from denoising score matching.

Autonomous navigation requires the ability to recognize and avoid obstacles, which can be achieved using visual, non-visual, or hybrid techniques. These methods use computer vision and machine learning algorithms and are implemented on a computer system, which may or may not be embedded in the vehicle.

However, the system requires a camera, a gimbal system and a separate image-processing device, which increases the weight and power consumption of the UAV, resulting in a shorter flight time. In addition, a large amount of computation and slow reaction speed can cause the camera to miss a proper landing moment. To solve these problems, in this study, the moving direction and relative distance between an object and the automatic landing system were measured using a receive signal strength indicator of the radio-frequency (RF) signal. To improve the movement direction and relative distance estimation accuracy, the noise in the RF signal was minimised using a low pass filter and moving average filter. Based on the filtered RF signal, the acceleration of the multicopter to reach the object was estimated by adopting the proportional navigation algorithm.

However, existing road infrastructure confronts challenges due to prolonged use and insufficient maintenance. Previous research on autonomous vehicle navigation has focused on determining the trajectory with the shortest distance, while neglecting road construction information, leading to potential time and energy inefficiencies in real‐world scenarios involving infrastructure development. To address this issue, a digital twin‐embedded multi‐objective autonomous vehicle navigation is proposed under the condition of infrastructure construction. The authors propose an image processing algorithm that leverages captured images of the road construction environment to enable road extraction and modelling of the autonomous vehicle workspace. Additionally, a wavelet neural network is developed to predict real‐time traffic flow, considering its inherent characteristics. Moreover, a multi‐objective brainstorm optimisation (BSO)‐based method for path planning is introduced, which optimises total time‐cost and energy consumption objective functions. To ensure optimal trajectory planning during infrastructure construction, the algorithm incorporates a real‐time updated digital twin throughout autonomous vehicle operations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are validated through simulation and comparative studies conducted in diverse scenarios involving road construction. The results highlight the improved performance and reliability of the autonomous vehicle system when equipped with the authors’ approach, demonstrating its potential for enhancing efficiency and minimising disruptions caused by road infrastructure development.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/csy2.12110'}, {'id': 2128, 'title': 'Exploration of robust and intelligent navigation algorithms to ensure off-road autonomous vehicle mobility', 'authors': 'Paramsothy Jayakumar, Christopher Goodin, Jordan Ewing, Seth Tau, Kumar B.

However, the self-localization uncertainty of an AUV with an acoustic receiver can potentially be reduced by leveraging passive acoustic ranging techniques. In particular, in shallow water, the range between an acoustic source and a passive receiver can be estimated using the waveguide invariant. In this work, we develop a sequential Bayes navigation filter that fuses passive recordings of an acoustic source with the measurements of an inertial sensor. The acoustic source can either be cooperative or a source of opportunity, e.g., a container ship. Using particle-based processing, our filter can either estimate the waveguide invariant or the AUV position by making use of a detailed nonlinear statistical model of the received signal. If the position of the AUV is accurately known, e.g., in the beginning of the AUV’s mission, the waveguide invariant can be estimated. Alternatively, assuming that accurate waveguide invariant information is available, range information can be obtained and used to improve the estimate of the AUV’s position.

Our approach introduces a polynomial curve to describe the lateral and longitudinal trajectories in the Frenet frame, known as the ‘motion primitives’, whose combination ensures that the planning area is properly covered. In addition, we can select a feasible, optimal and collision-free trajectory from such a set of motion primitives that is generated by considering the vehicle dynamics and comfort.

Current route-planning methods mainly focus on the road level and applying them directly to search for lane-level routes results in a reduction in search efficiency. In addition, previously developed lane-level methods lack consideration for vehicle characteristics and adaptability to multiple road network structures. To solve this issue, this study proposes an accelerated and refined lane-level route-planning algorithm based on a new lane-level road network model. First, five sub-layers are designed to refine the internal structure of the divided road and intersection areas so that the model can express multiple variations in road network structures. Then, a multi-level route-planning algorithm is designed for sequential planning at the road level, lane group level, lane section level, and lane level to reduce the search space and significantly improve routing efficiency. Last, an optimal lane determination algorithm considering traffic rules, vehicle characteristics, and optimization objectives is developed at the lane level to find the optimal lanes on roads with different configurations, including those with a constant or variable number of lanes while satisfying traffic rules and vehicle characteristics. Tests were performed on simulated road networks and a real road network. The results demonstrate the algorithm’s better adaptability to changing road network structures and vehicle characteristics compared with past hierarchical route planning, and its higher efficiency compared with direct route planning, past hierarchical route planning, and the Apollo route-planning method, which can better support autonomous vehicle navigation.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/wevj14040098'}, {'id': 2155, 'title': 'Camera Calibration Method for Autonomous Navigation based on Space Non-cooperative Target Features', 'authors': 'Bowen Hou, Han Yuan, Xuanying Zhou, Runran Deng, E Wei, Ping Liu', 'published': '2023-6-23', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isas59543.2023.10164618'}, {'id': 2156, 'title': 'Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation via Sensors Maximum-Ratio Combining in Absence of Bearing Angle Data', 'authors': 'Vadim Kramar, Aleksey Kabanov, Kirill Dementiev', 'published': '2023-9-22', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'This paper proposes a maximum-ratio combining sensor fusion scheme for using an extended Kalman filter in the underwater vehicle positioning task by means of communication devices (buoys) providing location information using a slant-range mechanism, inertial sensors, a Doppler velocity log, and a pressure sensor in the absence of bearing angle data.

Since the current logistics sorting manipulators mostly use visual sensors to identify objects, they are extremely vulnerable to the changes in the lighting environment. Therefore, the research considers the influence of complex lighting environment on the autonomous grasping of logistics sorting manipulators. Furthermore, it verifies the effectiveness of SAC-AE-ICM algorithm through simulations and experiments. The experimental results show that SAC-AE-ICM algorithm can quickly achieve convergence in many experiments and can obtain global optimization. In the process of automatic capture, the success rate of SAC-AE-ICM algorithm can reach 90%, which is 25% higher than that of the method without ICM and has better convergence. The success rate was as high as 77% for unknown or irregular targets. In practical experiments, SAC-AE-ICM can effectively capture under good lighting conditions. However, under low light conditions, the probability of capturing unknown targets is about 72.5%. Overall, the success rates for single-object and multi-object capture are 88% and 85%, respectively.

Model Predictive Control and Proportional Integral and Derivative Control are used in MATLAB simulation to build three car models.

They've been around for more than a decade, primarily in Europe. AGVs were formerly utilized mostly in production lines, but due to recent industrial development, they now play a vital role in a variety of different applications and domains, including warehouses, port facilities, transportation systems, and even the medical sector.\\xa0Goal.\\xa0The purpose of the work is to analyze two methods of AGV control and the paths that the AGV should follow during transport operations, taking into account safety and limitations for heavy loads that need to be transported in difficult conditions. Methodology. We attempted to provide a summary of the two existing AGV control methods, centralized and decentralized control offered by major manufacturers in this study. Almost all function in a centralized manner, with a single central controller controlling the whole fleet of AGVs. The author sees a tendency toward decentralized systems in which AGVs make individual decisions in favor of transportation flexibility, robustness, and adaptability. A brief explanation of well-known and mature navigation technologies used by AGVs in the industry is also provided, along with both physical and virtual paths to be followed by the AGV during transportation operations, since these technologies get to be a key issue given the safety constraints, particularly for heavy loads to be transported in challenging environments.\\xa0Results.

In this paper, we propose a precise underwater dead-reckoning mathematical model that recursively calculates the ground truth and corresponding errors based on an AUV’s motion model, and we derive empirical formulas.

Their widespread use and versatility allow them to perform tasks that, until recently, required human resources. One problem in AUVs is inadequate navigation, which results in inaccurate positioning. Weaknesses in electronic equipment lead to errors in determining a vehicle’s position during underwater missions, requiring periodic reduction of accumulated errors through the use of radio navigation systems (e.g., GNSS). However, these signals may be unavailable or deliberately distorted. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new computer vision-based method for estimating the position of an AUV. Our method uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to generate the surroundings of the vehicle during temporary surfacing at the point where it is currently located. The next step is to compare this with the shoreline representation on the map, which is generated for a set of points that are in a specific vicinity of a point determined by dead reckoning. This method is primarily intended for low-cost vehicles without advanced navigation systems. Our results suggest that the proposed solution reduces the error in vehicle positioning to 30–60 m and can be used in incomplete shoreline representations. Further research will focus on the use of the proposed method in fully autonomous navigation systems.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16050741'}, {'id': 2192, 'title': 'A Push-Pull Train for Safety of Autonomous Vehicle Software', 'authors': 'Suhrid A.

However, the data collection process can be hindered by noise or signal interruptions, thus diminishing the precision of the data. This paper uses the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model to solve the problem by masking the high-precision automatic dependent survey broadcast (ADS-B) trajectory data and estimating the mask position value based on the front and rear trajectory points during BERT model training. Through this process, the model acquires knowledge of intricate motion patterns within the trajectory data and acquires the BERT pre-training Model. Afterwards, a refined particle filter algorithm is utilized to generate alternative trajectory sets for observation trajectory data that is prone to noise. Ultimately, the BERT trajectory pre-training model is supplied with the alternative trajectory set, and the optimal trajectory is determined by computing the maximum posterior probability. The results of the experiment show that the model has good performance and is stronger than traditional algorithms.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23229120'}, {'id': 223, 'title': 'MNoR-BERT: multi-label classification of non-functional requirements using BERT', 'authors': 'Kamaljit Kaur, Parminder Kaur', 'published': '2023-10', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-08833-1'}, {'id': 224, 'title': 'CE-BERT: Concise and Efficient BERT-Based Model for Detecting Rumors on Twitter', 'authors': 'Rini Anggrainingsih, Ghulam Mubashar Hassan, Amitava Datta', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 4, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3299858'}, {'id': 225, 'title': 'Naming entity recognition of citrus pests and diseases based on the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model', 'authors': 'Yafei Liu, Siqi Wei, Haijun Huang, Qin Lai, Mengshan Li, Lixin Guan', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 4, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121103'}, {'id': 226, 'title': 'BERT Model-based Natural Language to NoSQL Query Conversion using Deep Learning Approach', 'authors': 'Kazi Mojammel Hossen, Mohammed Nasir Uddin, Minhazul Arefin, Md Ashraf Uddin', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.14569/ijacsa.2023.0140293'}, {'id': 227, 'title': 'CLES-BERT: Contrastive Learning-based BERT Model for Automated Essay Scoring', 'authors': 'Daegon Yu, Yongyeon Kim, Sangwoo Han, Byung-Won On', 'published': '2023-4-30', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.14801/jkiit.2023.21.4.31'}, {'id': 228, 'title': 'A false emotion opinion target extraction model with two stage BERT and background information fusion', 'authors': 'ZhiYang Hou, YaJun Du, QiZhi Li, XianYong Li, XiaoLiang Chen, HongMei Gao', 'published': '2024-9', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123735'}, {'id': 229, 'title': 'GeoTPE: A neural network model for geographical topic phrases extraction from literature based on BERT enhanced with relative position embedding', 'authors': 'Weirong Li, Kai Sun, Yunqiang Zhu, Fangyu Ding, Lei Hu, Xiaoliang Dai, Jia Song, Jie Yang, Lang Qian, Shu Wang', 'published': '2024-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121077'}, {'id': 230, 'title': 'A semantic-BERT model based on two Bi-LSTM-CNN for arabic question answering', 'authors': 'Abdullah Farhan Mahdi, Rabah N.

In this paper, we applied a fusion model combining Bert and TextRNN with some modified details to expect higher accuracy of text classification. We used the THUCNews as dataset which consists of two columns one for news text and the other for numbers. The original dataset was seperated into three parts: training set, validation set and test set. Besides, we used BERT model which contains two pre-training tasks and TextRNN model which refers to the use of RNN to solve text classification problems. We trained these two models in parallel, and then the optimal Bert and TextRNN models obtained through training and parameter tuning are added with a fully-connected layer to receive the final results by weighting the efficiency of Bert and TextRNN. The fusion model solves the problem of over-fitting and under-fitting of a single model, and helps to obtain a model with better generalization performance. The experimental results show the sharp change in loss and accuracy as well as the final accuracy of the BERT model. The precision, recall-rate and F1-score are also evaluated in this paper.

Nevertheless, in real-world usage scenarios, a substantial proportion of interactions fall into the open-domain category. User intentions frequently transcend predefined boundaries, giving rise to a multitude of out-of-domain intents, which pose a formidable challenge to existing models, ultimately leading to diminished recognition rates and accuracy. The demand for open intent detection models is increasing in today's society to address this issue effectively. This paper proposes a method to optimize datasets, thereby enhancing the training accuracy of open intent detection models. Specifically, this paper employs the Adaptive Decision Boundary Learning algorithm, which is currently popular in open intent detection. Leveraging this algorithm, this paper suggests using the K-means clustering algorithm to refine the intent labels within the dataset. This process helps identify and remove outliers in the dataset, making the distinction between known domain and open-domain intent labels more precise.

The web provides access to a tremendous amount of information, so it is difficult for internet users to locate accurate and useful information on the web. In order to categorize pages accurately based on the queries of users, methods of categorizing web pages need to be developed. The text content of web pages plays a significant role in the categorization of web pages. If a word’s position is altered within a sentence, causing a change in the interpretation of that sentence, this phenomenon is called polysemy. In web page categorization, the polysemy property causes ambiguity and is referred to as the polysemy problem. This paper proposes a fine-tuned model to solve the polysemy problem, using contextual embeddings created by the symmetry multi-head encoder layer of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated by using the benchmark datasets for web page categorization, i.e., WebKB and DMOZ.

Sarcasm is a figure of speech that uses opposite or contradictory language to express a certain meaning or idea. Sarcasm is usually cryptic, vague, and suggestive, which makes sarcasm prediction a challenging task. In sarcasm prediction projects, techniques of natural language processing are usually leveraged to analyze and classify the text. The main challenge of this task lies in the fact that sarcasm usually has multiple manifestations and needs to consider the contextual and semantic information of the text. The prediction of sarcasm holds significant application value in natural language processing, such as social media analysis, public opinion monitoring, sentiment analysis and so on. In this paper, by controlling variables, the influence of adding the long short-term memory (LSTM) layer and changing the grid structure of the model on the accuracy of prediction results is explored.

There is a huge collection of studies that make an effort to predict how useful online reviews will be and have produced conflicting results on the efficacy of different methodologies. Furthermore, many of the current solutions employ manual feature generation and conventional shallow learning methods, which restrict generalization. As a result, the goal of this research is to develop a general approach using transfer learning by applying the “BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)”-based model. The efficiency of BERT classification is then evaluated by comparing it with similar machine learning techniques. In the experimental evaluation, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance in terms of outstanding prediction and high accuracy compared to earlier research.

A novel approach is presented in this paper to improve the performance of an extractive summarization model based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) by incorporating topic modeling using the BERTopic model. Our method first utilizes BERTopic to identify the dominant topics in a document and then employs a BERT-based deep neural network to extract the most salient sentences related to those topics. Our experiments on the cable news network (CNN)/daily mail dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art BERT-based extractive summarization models in terms of recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation (ROUGE) scores, which resulted in an increase of 32.53% of ROUGE-1, 47.55% of ROUGE-2, and 16.63% of ROUGE-L when compared to baseline BERT-based extractive summarization models.

To address this issue, each application software market currently provides its own classification tags. However, several problems still exist, such as the lack of objectivity, hierarchy, and standardization in these classifications, which in turn affects the accuracy of precise software recommendations. Accordingly, a customized BERTopic model is proposed to cluster the software description texts of the application software and the automatic tagging and updating of the application software tags are realized according to the clusters obtained by topic clustering and the extracted subject words. At the same time, a data enhancement method based on the c-TF-IDF algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of imbalance of datasets, and then the classification model based on the BERT-BiLSTM model is trained on the labeled datasets to classify the software in the dimension of the application function, so as to realize the accurate software recommendation for users. Based on the experimental verification of two datasets, 21 categories in the SourceForge dataset and 19 categories in the Chinese App Store dataset are subclassed by the clustering results of the customized BERTopic model, and the tags of 138 subclasses and 262 subclasses are formed, respectively. In addition, a complete tagged software description text dataset is constructed and the software tags are updated automatically.

In this work, we present Layer-wise Adaptive Distillation (LAD), a task-specific distillation framework that can be used to reduce the model size of BERT. We design an iterative aggregation mechanism with multiple gate blocks in LAD to adaptively distill layer-wise internal knowledge from the teacher model to the student model. The proposed method enables an effective knowledge transfer process for a student model, without skipping any teacher layers.

Leveraging natural language as a universal knowledge representation, OmDet accumulates “visual vocabularies” from diverse datasets, unifying the task as a language‐conditioned detection framework. The multimodal detection network (MDN) overcomes the challenges of multi‐dataset joint training and generalizes to numerous training datasets without manual label taxonomy merging. The authors demonstrate superior performance of OmDet over strong baselines in object detection in the wild, open‐vocabulary detection, and phrase grounding, achieving state‐of‐the‐art results.

While such approaches perform well in standard benchmark tests, they often fail to accurately replicate the complexity of real‐world image degradation. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed the use of unpaired image training to implicitly model the degradation process. However, there is a significant domain gap between the real‐world LR and the synthetic LR images from HR, which severely degrades the SR performance. A novel unsupervised image‐blind super‐resolution method that exploits degradation feature‐based learning for real‐image super‐resolution reconstruction (RDFL) is proposed. Their approach learns the degradation process from HR to LR using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and constrains the data distribution of the synthetic LR with real degraded images. The authors then encode the degraded features into a Transformer‐based SR network for image super‐resolution reconstruction through degradation representation learning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RDFL method, which achieves visually pleasing reconstruction results.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cvi2.12262'}, {'id': 1139, 'title': 'An efficient mixed attention module', 'authors': 'Kuang Sheng, Pinghua Chen', 'published': '2023-6', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'AbstractRecently, the application of attention mechanisms in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has become a hot area in computer vision. Most existing methods focus on channel attention or spatial attention.

This article proposes an efficient mixed attention that combines channel information with spatial information using learnable broadcast addition to reduce this complexity. In particular, this module can simplify learning and improve performance with fewer parameters. Furthermore, our method uses an excitation method based on the Tanh function to reduce computational resources while maintaining model performance, and it is a lightweight attention module that can be used in arbitrary CNNs to improve performance.

However, the reconstruction of original video signals from sub‐sampled measurements is still a great challenge. To exploit the temporal redundancies within videos during the recovery, previous works tend to perform alignment on initial reconstructions, which are too coarse to provide accurate motion estimations. To solve this problem, the authors propose a novel reconstruction network, named TSRN, for compressive video sensing. Specifically, the authors utilise a number of stacked temporal shift reconstruction blocks (TSRBs) to enhance the initial reconstruction progressively. Each TSRB could learn the temporal structures by exchanging information with last and next time step, and no additional computations is imposed on the network compared to regular 2D convolutions due to the high efficiency of temporal shift operations. After the enhancement, a bidirectional alignment module to build accurate temporal dependencies directly with the help of optical flows is employed. Different from previous methods that only extract supplementary information from the key frames, the proposed alignment module can receive temporal information from the whole video sequence via bidirectional propagations, thus yielding better performance. Experimental results verify the superiority of the proposed method over other state‐of‐the‐art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cvi2.12234'}, {'id': 1143, 'title': 'Editor’s Note: Special Issue on 3D Computer Vision', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-023-01751-8'}, {'id': 1144, 'title': 'Pollinators as Data Collectors: Estimating Floral Diversity with Bees and Computer Vision', 'authors': 'Frederic Tausch, Jan Wagner, Simon Klaus', 'published': '2023-10-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccvw60793.2023.00071'}, {'id': 1145, 'title': 'Computer Vision for Ocean Eddy Detection in Infrared Imagery', 'authors': 'Evangelos Moschos, Alisa Kugusheva, Paul Coste, Alexandre Stegner', 'published': '2023-1', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/wacv56688.2023.00633'}, {'id': 1146, 'title': 'Single and multiple illuminant estimation using convex functions', 'authors': 'Zeinab Abedini, Mansour Jamzad', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103711'}, {'id': 1147, 'title': 'Difficulty Estimation with Action Scores for Computer Vision Tasks', 'authors': 'Octavio Arriaga, Sebastian Palacio, Matias Valdenegro-Toro', 'published': '2023-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cvprw59228.2023.00030'}, {'id': 1148, 'title': 'Concept Study for Dynamic Vision Sensor Based Insect Monitoring', 'authors': 'Regina Pohle-Fröhlich, Tobias Bolten', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011775500003417'}, {'id': 1149, 'title': 'Image amodal completion: A survey', 'authors': 'Jiayang Ao, Qiuhong Ke, Krista A.

This design is tailored to enhance the efficient capture of details and contextual information across diverse scales in images. Secondly, the authors introduce recurrent convolutional layers (RCL) and residual operations, designing the recurrent residual convolutional unit to optimise the LTSE structure. Additionally, a lightweight convolutional unit named separable recurrent residual convolutional unit is introduced to reduce the model parameters. Finally, the authors obtain the three‐scale decoding features from the decoder and warp them for a set of three‐scale pre‐warped maps. The authors fuse them into the synthesis network to generate high‐quality interpolated frames. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance with fewer model parameters.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cvi2.12281'}, {'id': 1151, 'title': 'Domain-aware triplet loss in domain generalization', 'authors': 'Kaiyu Guo, Brian C.

Previous domain adaptation approaches have predominantly focussed on global domain adaptation, neglecting class‐level information and resulting in suboptimal transfer performance. In recent years, a considerable number of researchers have explored class‐level domain adaptation, aiming to precisely align the distribution of diverse domains. Nevertheless, existing research on class‐level alignment tends to align domain features either on or in proximity to classification boundaries, which introduces ambiguous samples that can impact classification accuracy. In this study, the authors propose a novel strategy called class guided constraints (CGC) to tackle this issue. Specifically, CGC is employed to preserve the compactness within classes and separability between classes of domain features prior to class‐level alignment. Furthermore, the authors incorporate CGC in conjunction with similarity guided constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms numerous state‐of‐the‐art domain adaptation methods significantly and achieves greater improvements compared to the baseline approach.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cvi2.12226'}, {'id': 1158, 'title': 'Open Problems in Computer Vision for Wilderness SAR and The Search for Patricia Wu-Murad', 'authors': 'Thomas Manzini, Robin Murphy', 'published': '2023-10-2', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccvw60793.2023.00409'}, {'id': 1159, 'title': 'Applying Positional Encoding to Enhance Vision-Language Transformers', 'authors': 'Xuehao Liu, Sarah Delany, Susan McKeever', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011796100003417'}, {'id': 1160, 'title': 'Trajectory-Prediction with Vision: A Survey', 'authors': 'Apoorv Singh', 'published': '2023-10-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccvw60793.2023.00356'}, {'id': 1161, 'title': 'MATTE: Multi-task multi-scale attention', 'authors': 'Gjorgji Strezoski, Nanne van Noord, Marcel Worring', 'published': '2023-2', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103622'}, {'id': 1162, 'title': 'Extending function mixture network for improved spectral super-resolution', 'authors': 'Sadia Hussain, Brejesh Lall', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103834'}, {'id': 1163, 'title': 'Robotics and Computer Vision in the Brazilian Electoral Context: A Case Study', 'authors': 'Jairton Falcão Filho, Matheus Costa, Jonas Silva, Cecília Santos da Silva, Felipe Mendonca, Jefferson Norberto, Riei Rodrigues, Marcondes Silva Júnior', 'published': '2024', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0012379300003660'}, {'id': 1164, 'title': 'Uni-NLX: Unifying Textual Explanations for Vision and Vision-Language Tasks', 'authors': 'Fawaz Sammani, Nikos Deligiannis', 'published': '2023-10-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccvw60793.2023.00498'}, {'id': 1165, 'title': 'Fully synthetic training for image restoration tasks', 'authors': 'Raphaël Achddou, Yann Gousseau, Saïd Ladjal', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103723'}, {'id': 1166, 'title': 'Multi-layered self-attention mechanism for weakly supervised semantic segmentation', 'authors': 'Avinash Yaganapu, Mingon Kang', 'published': '2024-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2023.103886'}, {'id': 1167, 'title': 'Action Capsules: Human skeleton action recognition', 'authors': 'Ali Farajzadeh Bavil, Hamed Damirchi, Hamid D.

Most previous event‐based methods first transform the unstructured event data to structured data formats through voxelisation, and then employ advanced CNNs to extract temporal information. However, voxelisation inevitably leads to information loss, and processing the sparse voxels introduces severe computation redundancy. To address these limitations, this study proposes a point‐image fusion network (PIFNet). In our PIFNet, rich temporal information from the events can be directly extracted at the point level. Then, a fusion module is designed to fuse complementary cues from both points and images for frame interpolation.

Existing approaches typically rely on external tasks, for example, semantic segmentation, or pose estimation, to locate identifiable parts of given images. However, they heuristically utilise the predictions from off‐the‐shelf models, which may be sub‐optimal in terms of both local partition and computational efficiency. They also ignore the mutual information with other inputs, which weakens the representation capabilities of local features. In this study, the authors put forward a novel Attribute‐guided Transformer (AiT), which explicitly exploits pedestrian attributes as semantic priors for discriminative representation learning. Specifically, the authors first introduce an attribute learning process, which generates a set of attention maps highlighting the informative parts of pedestrian images. Then, the authors design a Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) to iteratively inject attribute information into global feature maps, aiming at suppressing unnecessary noise and inferring attribute‐aware representations. Last, the authors propose a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to exploit mutual information for aggregating attribute characteristics from different images, enhancing the representation capabilities of feature embedding.

The technique of fine‐grained alignment between cross‐modal features plays a key role in various successful methods that have been proposed. Nevertheless, existing methods cannot effectively utilise intra‐modal information to enhance feature representation and lack powerful similarity reasoning to get a precise similarity score. Intending to tackle these issues, a context‐aware Relation Enhancement and Similarity Reasoning model, called RESR, is proposed, which conducts both intra‐modal relation enhancement and inter‐modal similarity reasoning while considering the global‐context information. For intra‐modal relation enhancement, a novel context‐aware graph convolutional network is introduced to enhance local feature representations by utilising relation and global‐context information. For inter‐modal similarity reasoning, local and global similarity features are exploited by the bidirectional alignment of image and text, and the similarity reasoning is implemented among multi‐granularity similarity features. Finally, refined local and global similarity features are adaptively fused to get a precise similarity score.

Existing methods do not deal well with the effect of snow on the identity of object features or usually ignore or even discard potential information that can help improve the detection performance. To this end, the authors propose a novel and improved end‐to‐end object detection network joint image restoration. Specifically, in order to address the problem of identity degradation of object detection due to snow, an ingenious restoration‐detection dual branch network structure combined with a Multi‐Integrated Attention module is proposed, which can well mitigate the effect of snow on the identity of object features, thus improving the detection performance of the detector. In order to make more effective use of the features that are beneficial to the detection task, a Self‐Adaptive Feature Fusion module is introduced, which can help the network better learn the potential features that are beneficial to the detection and eliminate the effect of heavy or large local snow in the object area on detection by a special feature fusion, thus improving the network's detection capability in snowy. In addition, the authors construct a large‐scale, multi‐size snowy dataset called Synthetic and Real Snowy Dataset (SRSD), and it is a good and necessary complement and improvement to the existing snowy‐related tasks.

To address this issue, adversarial distillation has emerged as a potential solution, encouraging target models to mimic the output of the teachers. However, reliance on pre‐training teachers leads to additional training costs and raises concerns about the reliability of their knowledge. Furthermore, existing methods fail to consider the significant differences in unconfident samples between early and late stages, potentially resulting in robust overfitting. An adversarial defence method named Clean, Performance‐robust, and Performance‐sensitive Historical Information based Adversarial Self‐Distillation (CPr & PsHI‐ASD) is presented. Firstly, an adversarial self‐distillation replacement method based on clean, performance‐robust, and performance‐sensitive historical information is developed to eliminate pre‐training costs and enhance guidance reliability for the target model. Secondly, adversarial self‐distillation algorithms that leverage knowledge distilled from the previous iteration are introduced to facilitate the self‐distillation of adversarial knowledge and mitigate the problem of robust overfitting. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on CIFAR‐10, CIFAR‐100, and Tiny‐ImageNet datasets.

Addressing this need, the development of techniques for reducing image noise while preserving crucial features, such as edges, corners, and sharp structures, has become imperative. This paper delves into the significance of image denoising and introduces a novel approach utilizing a denoising autoencoder based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method adopts a meticulous two-step process to effectively eliminate noise. Initially, input images are segregated into training and testing sets. Subsequently, a denoising autoencoder model is trained using the designated training data. This model is then further refined through training on a CNN, enhancing its noise reduction capabilities. The evaluation of the system's performance is conducted using testing data to gauge its effectiveness. The study employs the MATLAB programming language for implementation and evaluation. Results, measured through RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) criteria on two distinct datasets—the Covid19-radiography-database and SIIM-medical-images—reveal that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches significantly. This approach is particularly promising for applications demanding enhanced image quality, such as the resolution enhancement of medical images.

These developments in information technologies have also affected the architecture. Artificial intelligence applications are encountered in many areas such as pricing estimation, energy conservation security systems of buildings, ventilation systems, user-oriented interactive design solutions, computer-aided programs used in the plan production phase and design process. When the literature on artificial intelligence applications in the architecture is reviewed, it can be seen that it generally includes shape grammars, graph theory, decision trees, constraint-based models, machine learning methods, RNN (Recursive Neural Networks), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithms. In this study, the use of artificial intelligence algorithms in architecture was examined, and an example was designed to determine the architectural structures of different periods by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). In the study, the open source TensorFlow library developed by Google and the Python programming language were used. Employing a statistical approach and utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a study has successfully classified the current flow patterns of buildings based on datasets comprising facades of Gothic, Modern, and Deconstructivist architectural styles. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of CNNs in accurately distinguishing the intricate details of diverse architectural styles. Recognizing elements from different periods using the CNN algorithm can examine not only individual buildings but also the relationship of buildings with their environments.

However, the theoretical understanding of convolutional structures, which are vital to many structured deep learning models, remains incomplete. To partially bridge this gap, this letter aims to develop generalization analysis for deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms using learning theory. Specifically, we focus on investigating robust regression using correntropy-induced loss functions derived from information-theoretic learning. Our analysis demonstrates an explicit convergence rate for deep CNN-based robust regression algorithms when the target function resides in the Korobov space.

Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs), unlike other methods, have the ability to learn the spatial characteristics of the sensors, which is targeted at the above problems in structural damage identification. However, under the influence of environmental interference, sensor instability, and other factors, part of the vibration signal can easily change its fundamental characteristics, and there is a possibility of misjudging structural damage. Therefore, on the basis of building a high-performance graphical convolutional deep learning model, this paper considers the integration of data fusion technology in the model decision-making layer and proposes a single-model decision-making fusion neural network (S_DFNN) model. Through experiments involving the frame model and the self-designed cable-stayed bridge model, it is concluded that this method has a better performance of damage recognition for different structures, and the accuracy is improved based on a single model and has good damage recognition performance. The method has better damage identification performance in different structures, and the accuracy rate is improved based on the single model, which has a very good damage identification effect.

Genome-based diagnostics relying on DNA sequencing have benefited hugely from the boom in computing power in recent decades, particularly due to cloud-computing and the rise of graphics processing units (GPUs) and other advanced computing platforms for running advanced algorithms. Translating the success of such breakthroughs in diagnostics to affordable solutions for low-cost healthcare requires development of algorithms that can operate on the edge instead of in the cloud, using low-cost and low-power electronic systems such as microcontrollers and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present EdgeAlign, a deep reinforcement learning based method for performing pairwise DNA sequence alignment on stand-alone edge devices. EdgeAlign uses deep reinforcement learning to train a deep Q-network (DQN) agent for performing sequence alignment on fixed length sub-sequences, using a sliding window that is scanned over the length of the entire sequence. The hardware resource-consumption for implementing this scheme is thus independent of the lengths of the sequences to be aligned, and is further optimized using a novel AutoML based method for neural network model size reduction. Unlike other algorithms for sequence alignment reported in literature, the model demonstrated in this work is highly compact and deployed on two edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit and Digilent Arty A7-100T, containing Xilinx XC7A35T Artix-7 FPGA) for demonstration of alignment for sequences from the publicly available Influenza sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Virus Data Hub.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-29277-6'}, {'id': 607, 'title': 'A Dynamic Deep Learning Ecosystem for Real-Time Cognitive Data Processing on Industrial Edge Devices', 'authors': 'Sidhant Das', 'published': '2023-12-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ictbig59752.2023.10455984'}, {'id': 608, 'title': 'Applications of deep learning and artificial intelligence methods to smart edge devices and stereo cameras', 'authors': 'Cosmo Capodiferro, Mauro Mazzei', 'published': '2023-6-20', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/splitech58164.2023.10193298'}, {'id': 609, 'title': 'FedNets: Federated Learning on Edge Devices Using Ensembles of Pruned Deep Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Besher Alhalabi, Shadi Basurra, Mohamed Medhat Gaber', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3261266'}, {'id': 610, 'title': 'Optimizing data processing for edge-enabled IoT devices using deep learning based heterogeneous data clustering approach', 'authors': 'Majjari Sudhakar, Koteswara Rao Anne', 'published': '2024-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measen.2023.101013'}, {'id': 611, 'title': 'Real-Time Mastitis Detection in Livestock using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Leveraging Edge Devices', 'authors': 'Kawshik Kumar Ghosh, Md.

Furthermore, typical hardware accelerators cannot be embedded in these resource-constrained edge devices, and they are difficult to drive real-time inference processing as well. To perform the real-time processing on these battery-operated devices, deep learning models should be compact and hardware-optimized, and hardware accelerator designs also have to be lightweight and consume extremely low energy. Therefore, we present an optimized network model through model simplification and compression for the hardware to be implemented, and propose a hardware architecture for a lightweight and energy-efficient deep learning accelerator.

Previous research predominantly relied on basic color features, a methodology that has since been surpassed by adopting deep learning models for enhanced accuracy. Nevertheless, the persistence of false alarms and increased computational demands remains challenging. Furthermore, contemporary feed-forward neural networks face difficulties stemming from their initialization and weight allocation processes, often resulting in vanishing-gradient issues that hinder convergence. This investigation recognizes the considerable challenges and introduces the cost-effective Encoded EfficientNet (E-EFNet) model. This model demonstrates exceptional proficiency in fire recognition while concurrently mitigating the incidence of false alarms. E-EFNet leverages the lightweight EfficientNetB0 as a foundational feature extractor, augmented by a series of stacked autoencoders for refined feature extraction before the final classification phase. In contrast to conventional linear connections, E-EFNet adopts dense connections, significantly enhancing its effectiveness in identifying fire-related scenes. We employ a randomized weight initialization strategy to mitigate the vexing problem of vanishing gradients and expedite convergence. Comprehensive evaluation against contemporary state-of-the-art benchmarks reaffirms E-EFNet’s superior recognition capabilities. The proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy over the Foggia and Yar datasets by achieving a higher accuracy of 0.31 and 0.40, respectively, and its adaptability for efficient inferencing on edge devices.

Our empirical findings indicate that Mel spectrograms outperform raw audio data, attributing this enhancement to their synergistic alignment with advanced image classification algorithms and their congruence with human auditory perception. To address the constraints of model size, we apply model-compression techniques, notably magnitude pruning, Taylor pruning, and 8-bit quantization. The research demonstrates that a hybrid pruned model achieves a commendable accuracy rate of 89 percent, which, although marginally lower than the 92 percent accuracy of the uncompressed CNN, strikingly illustrates an equilibrium between efficiency and performance.

Despite the increasing development of Deep Learning (DL) methods for general object detection, weapon detection from surveillance videos still presents open challenges. Among these, the most significant are: (i) the very small size of the weapons with respect to the camera field of view and (ii) the need of a real-time feedback, even when using low-cost edge devices for computation. Complex and recently-developed DL architectures could mitigate the former challenge but do not satisfy the latter one. To tackle such limitation, the proposed work addresses the weapon-detection task from an edge perspective. A double-step DL approach was developed and evaluated against other state-of-the-art methods on a custom indoor surveillance dataset. The approach is based on a first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for people detection which guides a second CNN to identify handguns and knives. To evaluate the performance in a real-world indoor environment, the approach was deployed on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge device which was connected to an IP camera. The system achieved near real-time performance without relying on expensive hardware.

As the IoT ecosystem continues to burgeon, there arises an exigency for resource-conscious algorithms that can effectively navigate the intricacies of data routing while minimizing energy consumption levels. This paper illuminates a pivotal advancement in this domain, introducing a novel paradigm for different scenarios. Existing methodologies have long grappled with the challenge of balancing the ever-increasing computational demands of IoT devices with their constrained power resources. Conventional routing strategies often lack the depth required to optimize energy consumption, resulting in inefficiencies that hamper overall system performance. Prior research has primarily focused on rudimentary routing techniques that fall short in addressing the multifaceted demands of contemporary IoT ecosystems. In response to these limitations, this paper propounds a breakthrough model that leverages the power of Deep Dyna Q integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This fusion of cutting-edge technologies not only enhances energy efficiency but also ushers in a new era of intelligent data routing within IoT deployments. The chosen methodology is deliberate; Deep Dyna Q harnesses the power of reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt routing decisions, while the LSTM-based RNN augments the model's ability to capture contextual dependencies crucial in IoT scenarios. This synergy engenders superior energy optimization, transforming the way data is routed in IoT edge devices & samples. The results are resoundingly positive, with empirical evidence showcasing the model's prowess. Tested across multiple contextual datasets, our approach exhibits a remarkable 10.5% improvement in energy efficiency, a commendable 8.5% boost in speed, a 3.9% uptick in throughput, a 4.5% surge in packet delivery ratio, and a notable 4.9% enhancement in consistency when compared against existing methods. Such substantial improvements underscore the transformative impact of our work, setting new standards for energy-efficient data routing in IoT deployments.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.52710/rjcse.57'}, {'id': 657, 'title': 'Reaching for the Sky: Maximizing Deep Learning Inference Throughput on Edge Devices with AI Multi-Tenancy', 'authors': 'Jianwei Hao, Piyush Subedi, Lakshmish Ramaswamy, In Kee Kim', 'published': '2023-2-28', 'citations': 5, 'abstract': 'The wide adoption of smart devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors has led to massive growth in data generation at the edge of the Internet over the past decade. Intelligent real-time analysis of such a high volume of data, particularly leveraging highly accurate deep learning (DL) models, often requires the data to be processed as close to the data sources (or at the edge of the Internet) to minimize the network and processing latency. The advent of specialized, low-cost, and power-efficient edge devices has greatly facilitated DL inference tasks at the edge. However, limited research has been done to improve the inference throughput (e.g., number of inferences per second) by exploiting various system techniques. This study investigates system techniques, such as batched inferencing, AI multi-tenancy, and cluster of AI accelerators, which can significantly enhance the overall inference throughput on edge devices with DL models for image classification tasks. In particular, AI multi-tenancy enables collective utilization of edge devices’ system resources (CPU, GPU) and AI accelerators (e.g., Edge Tensor Processing Units; EdgeTPUs). The evaluation results show that batched inferencing results in more than 2.4× throughput improvement on devices equipped with high-performance GPUs like Jetson Xavier NX. Moreover, with multi-tenancy approaches, e.g., concurrent model executions (CME) and dynamic model placements (DMP), the DL inference throughput on edge devices (with GPUs) and EdgeTPU can be further improved by up to 3× and 10×, respectively. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of hardware and software factors that change the DL inference throughput on edge devices and EdgeTPUs, thereby shedding light on areas that could be further improved to achieve high-performance DL inference at the edge.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3546192'}, {'id': 658, 'title': 'Characterizing the Performance of Accelerated Jetson Edge Devices for Training Deep Learning Models', 'authors': 'Prashanthi S.K, Sai Anuroop Kesanapalli, Yogesh Simmhan', 'published': '2023-6-19', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3578338.3593530'}, {'id': 659, 'title': 'Convergence of Deep Learning and Edge Computing using Model Optimization', 'authors': 'Peyman Babaei', 'published': '2024-3-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mvip62238.2024.10491145'}, {'id': 660, 'title': 'Assessment of Human Blastocyst using Deep Learning Algorithm', 'authors': 'Malathi Eswaran, Balasubramanie P, Pradeepa V', 'published': '2023-7-19', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icecaa58104.2023.10212175'}, {'id': 661, 'title': 'A Novel Deep Learning-Based Malware Detection Scheme Considering Packers and Encryption', 'authors': 'Weixiang Cai', 'published': '2023-7-19', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icecaa58104.2023.10212205'}, {'id': 662, 'title': 'Implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Securing the Devices in IOT Systems', 'authors': 'Salunkhe Madhav Jagannath,  , Rajendra B Mohite, Mukesh Kumar Gupta, Onkar S Lamba', 'published': '2023-5-3', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.17485/ijst/v16i9.99'}, {'id': 663, 'title': 'Deep Reinforcement Learning for Edge Caching with Mobility Prediction in Vehicular Networks', 'authors': 'Yoonjeong Choi, Yujin Lim', 'published': '2023-2-3', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'As vehicles are connected to the Internet, various services can be provided to users. However, if the requests of vehicle users are concentrated on the remote server, the transmission delay increases, and there is a high possibility that the delay constraint cannot be satisfied. To solve this problem, caching can be performed at a closer proximity to the user which in turn would reduce the latency by distributing requests. The road side unit (RSU) and vehicle can serve as caching nodes by providing storage space closer to users through a mobile edge computing (MEC) server and an on-board unit (OBU), respectively. In this paper, we propose a caching strategy for both RSUs and vehicles with the goal of maximizing the caching node throughput. The vehicles move at a greater speed; thus, if positions of the vehicles are predictable in advance, this helps to determine the location and type of content that has to be cached. By using the temporal and spatial characteristics of vehicles, we adopted a long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the locations of the vehicles. To respond to time-varying content popularity, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) was used to determine the size of each piece of content to be stored in the caching nodes. Experiments in various environments have proven that the proposed algorithm performs better when compared to other caching methods in terms of the throughput of caching nodes, delay constraint satisfaction, and update cost.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23031732'}, {'id': 664, 'title': 'Multimodal Deep Learning with Boosted Trees for Edge Inference', 'authors': 'Penny Chong, Laura Wynter, Bharathi Chaudhury', 'published': '2023-12-4', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icdmw60847.2023.00021'}, {'id': 665, 'title': 'A Novel Survey on Panoptic Segmentation using Deep Learning Approaches', 'authors': 'Pulipati Nagaraju, S.V.

The appropriate response to an ethics of AI has certainly been contentious. For some years the wisdom of deontology and utilitarianism in the ethics of technology has been questioned. Today, a kind of AI ethics principlism has gained a degree of widespread acceptance, yet it still invites harsh rejections in recent scholarship. In this paper, we wish to explore the contribution to an ethics of AI made by a narrative philosophy and ethics of technology inspired by the ‘little ethics’ of Paul Ricoeur, and virtue ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre, most recently and promisingly built upon by Wessel Reijers and Mark Coeckelbergh.  The objective of this paper is to examine the extent to which a narrative and virtue based ethics (or, VPD, i.e., virtuous practice design) might be a plausible candidate for the foundation of an ethics of AI, or rather ethical AI practice. This will be achieved by exploring the ways in which this approach can respond to some of the significant faults with or critiques of applied and principles and guidelines based ethical approaches to AI ethics.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-024-00472-z'}, {'id': 802, 'title': 'The Epistemic Status of AI in Medical Practices: Ethical Challenges', 'authors': 'Angelina Baeva', 'published': '2024-3-11', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'In recent years, discussions have been increasingly emerging in modern scientific research that, in connection with the development of AI technologies, questions arise about the objectivity, plausibility and reliability of knowledge, as well as whether these technologies will not replace the expert figure as the authority that has so far acted as a guarantor of objectivity and the center of decision-making. Modern historians of science Duston L. and Galison P. in their book on the history of scientific objectivity, they talk about the alternation of \"epistemic virtues\", as one of which objectivity has been established since a certain moment. At the same time, the promotion of one or another virtue regulating the scientific self, i.e. acting as a normative principle for a scientist when choosing one or another way of seeing and one or another scientific practice, depends on making decisions in difficult cases requiring the will and limitation of the self. In this sense, epistemology is combined with ethics: a scientist, guided by certain moral principles, gives preference to one or another way of behavior, choosing, for example, not a more accurate hand-drawn image, but an uncluttered photograph, perhaps fuzzy, but obtained mechanically, which means more objective and free from any admixture of subjectivity. In this regard, the epistemic status of modern AI-based technologies, which increasingly assume the functions of the scientific self, including in terms of influencing final decision-making and obtaining objective knowledge, seems interesting. For example, in the field of medicine, robotic devices already provide significant support, taking over some of the functions, for example, of a first-level doctor to collect and analyze standardized patient data and diagnostics. There is an assumption that AI will take on more and more responsibilities in the near future: data processing, development of new drugs and treatment methods, establishing remote interaction with the patient, etc. But does this mean that the scientific self can be replaced by AI-based algorithms, and another epistemic virtue will replace objectivity, finally breaking the link between ethics and epistemology – this question needs to be investigated.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.17816/dd625319'}, {'id': 803, 'title': 'Accountability for Responsible AI Practices: Ethical Responsibilities of Senior Leadership', 'authors': 'Alex John London', 'published': '2024', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4736880'}, {'id': 804, 'title': 'Ethical Requirements Stack: A framework for implementing ethical requirements of AI in software engineering practices', 'authors': 'Mamia Agbese, Rahul Mohanani, Arif Ali Khan, Pekka Abrahamsson', 'published': '2023-6-14', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3593434.3593489'}, {'id': 805, 'title': 'Navigating the AI frontier: ethical considerations and best practices in microbial genomics research', 'authors': 'Andrew J.

AI is usually deployed with good intentions, to unlock value and create opportunities for the people; however it does not come without its challenges. There are a set of ethical–social issues associated with AI, which include concerns around privacy, data protection, job displacement, historical bias and discrimination. Through a series of focus groups with knowledgeable people embedded in India and its culture, this research explores the ethical–societal changes and challenges that India now faces. Further, it investigates whether the principles and practices of responsible research and innovation (RRI) might provide a framework to help identify and deal with these issues. The results show that the areas in which RRI could offer scope to improve this outlook include education, policy and governance, legislation and regulation, and innovation and industry practices. Some significant challenges described by participants included: the lack of awareness of AI by the public as well as policy makers; India’s access and implementation of Western datasets, resulting in a lack of diversity, exacerbation of existing power asymmetries, increase in social inequality and the creation of bias; the potential replacement of jobs by AI. One option was to look at a hybrid approach, a mix of AI and humans, with expansion and upskilling of the current workforce.

Drawing on fieldwork undertaken at three of Sama’s East African delivery centres in Kenya and Uganda and follow-up online interviews, this article interrogates Sama’s claims regarding the benefits of its impact sourcing model. Our analysis reveals alarming accounts of low wages, insecure work, a tightly disciplined labour management process, gender-based exploitation and harassment and a system designed to extract value from low-paid workers to produce profits for investors. We argue that competitive market-based dynamics generate a powerful force that pushes such companies towards limiting the actual social impact of their business model in favour of ensuring higher profit margins. This force can be resisted, but only through countervailing measures such as pressure from organised workers, civil society, or regulation.

Due to AI's autonomy and mission performance capabilities, AI is sometimes viewed as an agent competing with humans. However, since the autonomy and mission performance capabilities of AI are applied at very diverse levels and areas, it is necessary to set certain categories and review their application. This study sought to reveal that more valid decisions can be made by collaborating between humans and AI in the category of ethical decision-making.\\r\\nMethod: This study uses methods of literature research and development research. First, using literature research to review various previous studies to understand the autonomy of AI in the relationship between humans and AI. Next, analyzing the meaning and characteristics of ethical judgment. Next, looking at a series of models that explain decision making. Second, using development research methods, for design and propose a model in which humans and AI appropriately collaborate in the process of making ethical decisions.\\r\\nResults: The results of this study reveal the following points. First, the results of ethical decision-making by humans and AI involve greater responsibility and related issues than the results of general decision-making. Second, in order to solve these problems, it is necessary to utilize collective intelligence through collective decision-making and at the same time distribute responsibility. Third, as a public and collective entity functioning as a committee, humans become the subjects of final judgment and responsibility, and AI must play a role in actively and functionally assisting such judgment. Fourth, this decision-making process needs to be presented in the form of a model as a principle that can be applied to various specific cases.\\r\\nConclusion: The conclusion of this study suggests that effective and valid ethical decisions can be made through collaboration between humans and AI in the ethical communication process. And based on this, we present a collaboration model between humans and AI. This model consists of the following steps: First, AI should be actively involved in the process of exploring data sources, collecting data, storing data, and refining and analyzing data for ethical decisions. Second, ethical decisions based on this are made by a human community in the form of a committee as a group thinking process. Third, allow humans and AI to evaluate and exchange opinions on the results of these ethical judgments through mutual feedback and collaboration.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.22471/ai.2023.8.12'}, {'id': 820, 'title': 'Ethical AI governance: mapping a research ecosystem', 'authors': 'Simon Knight, Antonette Shibani, Nicole Vincent', 'published': '2024-2-14', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'AbstractHow do we assess the positive and negative impacts of research about- or research that employs artificial intelligence (AI), and how adequate are existing research governance frameworks for these ends?

These findings pave the way for future research on the management of controversial technology and the ethics of AI.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01648-7'}, {'id': 824, 'title': 'Ethical AI: Proposal to bridge the gap in EU regulation on trustworthy AI and to support practical implementation of ethical perspectives', 'authors': 'Alexandra Prisznyák', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'In 2020, GPT-3 defined itself as a thinking robot.

The discussion is spurred by recent incidents involving notable AI systems, demonstrating that AI recalls can be a very real necessity. This study delves into the concept of product recall as traditionally understood in industry and explores its potential application to AI systems. Our analysis of this concept is centered around two prominent categories of recall drivers in the AI domain: ethical-social and legal considerations. In terms of ethical-social drivers, we apply the innovative notion of “moral Operational Design Domain”, suggesting AI systems should be recalled when they violate ethical principles and societal expectation. In addition, we also explore the recall of AI systems from a legal perspective, where the recently proposed AI Act provides regulatory measures for recalling AI systems that pose risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights. The paper also underscores the need for further research, especially around defining precise ethical and societal triggers for AI recalls, creating an efficient recall management framework for organizations, and reassessing the fit of traditional product recall models for AI systems within the AI Act's regulatory context. By probing these complex intersections between AI, ethics, and regulation, this work aims to contribute to the development of robust and responsible AI systems while maintaining readiness for failure scenarios.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00327-z'}, {'id': 831, 'title': 'Ethical Issues Posed by ‘Generative-AI’ (G-AI) - Response strategies for ‘Good AI Society’', 'authors': 'Sunghee Yoo', 'published': '2023-6-30', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.37305/jkba.2023.06.24.1.1'}, {'id': 832, 'title': 'The human role to guarantee an ethical AI in healthcare: a five-facts approach', 'authors': 'Raquel Iniesta', 'published': '2023-10-25', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'AbstractWith the emergence of AI systems to assist clinical decision-making, several ethical dilemmas are brought to the general attention. AI systems are claimed to be the solution for many high-skilled medical tasks where machines can potentially surpass human ability as for example in identifying normal and abnormal chest X-rays. However, there are also warns that AI tools could be the basis for a human replacement that can risk dehumanisation in medicine. In recent years, important proposals in the domain of AI ethics in healthcare have identified main ethical issues, as for example fairness, autonomy, transparency, and responsibility. The human warranty, which implies human evaluation of the AI procedures, has been described to lower the ethical risks. However, as relevant these works have been, translating principles into action has proved challenging as existing codes were mostly a description of principles. There is a great need to produce how-to proposals that are specific enough to be action-guiding. We present five human-focussed facts designed into a framework of human action for an ethical AI in healthcare. Through the factors, we examine the role of medical practitioners, patients, and developers in designing, implementing, and using AI in a responsible manner that preserves human dignity. The facts encompass a range of ethical concerns that were commonly found in relevant literature.

As applications of AI become more versatile and entwined with society, an ever-wider spectrum of considerations must be incorporated into their decision-making. However, formulating less-tangible human values into mathematical algorithms appears incredibly challenging. This difficulty is understandable from a viewpoint that perceives human moral decisions to primarily stem from intuition and emotional dispositions, rather than logic or reason. Our innate normative judgements promote prosocial behaviours which enable collaboration within a shared environment. Individuals internalise the values and norms of their social context through socialisation. The complexity of the social environment makes it impractical to consistently apply logic to pick the best available action. This has compelled natural agents to develop mental shortcuts and rely on the collective moral wisdom of the social group. This work argues that the acquisition of human values cannot happen just through rational thinking, and hence, alternative approaches should be explored. Designing receptiveness to social signalling can provide context-flexible normative guidance in vastly different life tasks. This approach would approximate the human trajectory for value learning, which requires social ability. Artificial agents that imitate socialisation would prioritise conformity by minimising detected or expected disapproval while associating relative importance with acquired concepts. Sensitivity to direct social feedback would especially be useful for AI that possesses some embodied physical or virtual form. Work explores the necessary faculties for social norm enforcement and the ethical challenges of navigating based on the approval of others.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00372-8'}, {'id': 837, 'title': 'Ethical AI does not have to be like finding a black cat in a dark room', 'authors': 'Apala Lahiri Chavan, Eric Schaffer', 'published': '2023-5-4', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00146-023-01661-w'}, {'id': 838, 'title': 'From ethical AI frameworks to tools: a review of approaches', 'authors': 'Erich Prem', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 20, 'abstract': 'AbstractIn reaction to concerns about a broad range of potential ethical issues, dozens of proposals for addressing ethical aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) have been published.

The various proposed ethical frameworks can be considered an instance of principlism that is similar to that found in medical ethics. Given their general nature, principles do not say how they should be applied in a particular context. Hence, a broad range of approaches, methods, and tools have been proposed for addressing ethical concerns of AI systems. This paper presents a systematic analysis of more than 100 frameworks, process models, and proposed remedies and tools for helping to make the necessary shift from principles to implementation, expanding on the work of Morley and colleagues.

Acknowledging the complexity of ethical considerations in medicine influenced by cultural, socio-economic, and legal factors, the objective is to synthesize insights from various studies and delve into key themes such as patient autonomy, informed consent, healthcare equity, and the ethical implications of emerging technologies. Methodology: Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 2020, this analysis systematically reviewed scholarly articles focusing on ethical considerations within modern medical practices from 2020 to 2023. A thorough screening process, based on specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, was conducted in major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar). Eleven relevant studies were included, representing diverse perspectives and ethical frameworks. Result: The systematic study selection process identified 11 relevant studies from an initial pool of 297 records. These studies covered a range of topics, including parental decision-making for adolescents with mental health issues, the legalization of medical cannabis, challenges in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic and medical education ethics. The included studies were subjected to a meticulous evaluation of their characteristics, outcomes, and limitations. The findings contribute valuable insights into the multifaceted ethical dimensions of contemporary medical practices. Conclusion: This systematic review and analysis provide a comprehensive overview of diverse ethical perspectives inherent in contemporary medical practices. While recognizing the complexity of medical ethics, influenced by various factors, the study identifies patterns, gaps and divergent viewpoints within the selected studies. The analysis aims to inform practitioners, policymakers, and scholars engaged in ethical decision-making in healthcare, fostering a more informed and ethically robust approach to modern medical practices.

We argue that societal inequalities may be introduced or exacerbated by (1) unequal access to the technologies, (2) unequally distributed restrictions to liberty and subjection to coercion, and (3) the potentially disparate impact of the use of e-coaching technologies on (self-)stigmatizing perceptions of competence. The article offers a research agenda for studying and addressing these concerns.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-024-00424-7'}, {'id': 863, 'title': 'The Ethical and Social Implications of Using AI in Healthcare - A Literature Review', 'authors': 'Suyash Bhogawar, Siddhartha Nuthakki, Sanju Mannumadam Venugopal, Sreeram Mullankandy', 'published': '2023-11-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.21275/sr231116135559'}, {'id': 864, 'title': 'ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN AI: NAVIGATING BIAS, FAIRNESS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY (2020)', 'authors': '', 'published': '2024-3-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.48047/jcr.07.03.375'}, {'id': 865, 'title': 'On educating ethics in the AI era: why business schools need to move beyond digital upskilling, towards ethical upskilling', 'authors': 'David De Cremer, Devesh Narayanan', 'published': '2023-11', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00306-4'}, {'id': 866, 'title': 'A Case Study on AI Engineering Practices: Developing an Autonomous Stock Trading System', 'authors': 'Marcel Grote, Justus Bogner', 'published': '2023-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cain58948.2023.00032'}, {'id': 867, 'title': 'Guidance for researchers and peer-reviewers on the ethical use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in scientific research workflows', 'authors': 'Ryan Watkins', 'published': '2023-5-16', 'citations': 6, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00294-5'}, {'id': 868, 'title': 'The ethical ambiguity of AI data enrichment: Measuring gaps in research ethics norms and practices', 'authors': 'Will Hawkins, Brent Mittelstadt', 'published': '2023-6-12', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3593013.3593995'}, {'id': 869, 'title': 'Exploring the Human-AI Nexus: A Friendly Dispute Between Second-Order Cybernetical Ethical Thinking and Questions of AI Ethics', 'authors': 'Dietmar Koering', 'published': '2023-5-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.58695/ec.4'}, {'id': 870, 'title': 'Trustworthy AI: A Fuzzy-Multiple Method for Evaluating Ethical Principles in AI Regulations', 'authors': 'Oksana Adamyk, Oksana Chereshnyuk, Bogdan Adamyk, Serhii Rylieiev', 'published': '2023-9-21', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/acit58437.2023.10275505'}, {'id': 871, 'title': 'In defense of ethical guidelines', 'authors': 'Björn Lundgren', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'AbstractRecently, Luke Munn attacked “AI ethics” generally, or guidelines, principles, codes of ethics, ethical frameworks.

There is a pressing need to improve metrics for assessing security and privacy of AI systems and to manage AI technology in a more ethical manner. To address these challenges, an AI Trust Framework and Maturity Model is proposed to enhance trust in the design and management of AI systems. Trust in AI involves an agreed-upon understanding between humans and machines about system performance. The framework utilizes an “entropy lens” to root the study in information theory and enhance transparency and trust in “black box” AI systems, which lack ethical guardrails. High entropy in AI systems can decrease human trust, particularly in uncertain and competitive environments. The research draws inspiration from entropy studies to improve trust and performance in autonomous human–machine teams and systems, including interconnected elements in hierarchical systems. Applying this lens to improve trust in AI also highlights new opportunities to optimize performance in teams. Two use cases are described to validate the AI framework’s ability to measure trust in the design and management of AI systems.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e25101429'}, {'id': 873, 'title': 'Review of: \"Ethical and political consumption: an integrated typology of practices\"', 'authors': 'Mahsa Ghaffari', 'published': '2023-6-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': '', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.32388/79g8jc'}, {'id': 874, 'title': 'AI Health Ethical Review: A Value Design Methodology', 'authors': 'Elizaveta A.

The healthcare sector is no exception, and artificial intelligence systems are becoming more and more widespread in this area. While AI can help us make more informed and efficient decisions, it also presents many moral and ethical challenges. One of the biggest issues is the issue of trust. When &quot;machine&quot; replaces &quot;human&quot; decision making, it can be difficult for patients and healthcare professionals to trust the outcome. In addition, the &quot;black box&quot; mechanisms in artificial intelligence systems make it unclear who is responsible for the decisions made, which can lead to ethical dilemmas. In addition, there is a risk of emotional frustration for patients and healthcare professionals, as AI may not be able to provide the kind of human touch that is often needed in healthcare. Despite increased attention to these issues in recent years, technical solutions to these complex moral and ethical issues are often developed without regard to the social context and opinions of the advocates affected by the technology. In addition, calls for more ethical and socially responsible AI often focus on basic legal principles such as &quot;transparency&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot; and leave out the much more problematic area of human values. To solve this problem, the article proposes a &quot;value-sensitive&quot; approach to the development of AI, which can help translate basic human rights and values into context-sensitive requirements for AI algorithms. This approach can help create a route from human values to clear and understandable requirements for AI design. It can also help overcome ethical issues that hinder the responsible implementation of AI in healthcare and everyday life.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/s023620070026109-6'}, {'id': 875, 'title': 'The question of \"Mind-sets\" and AI: Cultural origins and limits of the current AI  Ethical AIs and Cultural Pluralism', 'authors': 'Badrudin Amershi', 'published': '2023-1-4', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'The current process of scientific and technological development is the outcome of the epochal Cultural Revolution in the West: i.e. the emergence of the Age of Enlightenment and its pursuit of \"rationality\".

Therefore, in this study, we interviewed 12 experts from philosophy, AI and cognitive sciences to shed light on computational ethics beyond a technical perspective. Findings suggest that indicated supporting and opposing arguments can be clustered into pragmatic/practical, societal and epistemic reasons, all of which need to be contemplated when engaging in computational ethics and developing resulting artificial moral agents.

I suggest that researchers not only work on reflecting on their body (actions), speech (talk), and mind (thoughts) but more importantly, move beyond just reflection and reflexivity to facing and resolving “unwholesome” moments that may arise during the research process. I thus demonstrate how to repent in regard to one’s research-related actions, speech, and thoughts, with a particular focus on doing-no-harm and truthfulness. To illustrate, I offer an example from my own research that highlights how Buddhist teachings might be relevant in practice.

Furthermore, since data is extensively dispersed across huge networks of connected devices, decentralized computing is critical. Federated learning (FL) systems in the recent times has gained popularity as the distributed machine learning model that enables IoT edge devices to collaboratively train models in a decentralized manner while ensuring that data on a user’s device stays private without the contents or details of that data ever leaving that device. In this paper, we propose a federated learning based intrusion detection system using LSTM Autoencoder. The proposed technique allows IoT devices to train a global model without revealing their private data, enabling the training model to grow in size while protecting each participants local data.

However, the classic FL methods with synchronous aggregation strategies, in many cases, shall suffer from limitations in resource utilization due to the need to wait for slower devices (stragglers) to aggregate during each training epoch. In addition, the accuracy of the global model can be affected by the uneven distribution of data among unreliable devices in real-world scenarios. Therefore, many Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) methods have been developed on many occasions to improve communication efficiency, model performance, privacy, and security. This article elaborates on the existing research on AFL and its applications in many areas. The paper first introduces the concept and development of FL, and then discusses in detail the related work and main research directions of AFL, including dealing with stragglers, staleness, communication efficiency between devices, and privacy and scalability issues. Then, this paper also explores the application of AFL in different fields, especially in the fields of mobile device edge computing, Internet of Things devices, and medical data analysis.

Without the need tocentralize all data in one place for training, it collect updates of model training after devices train models at local, and thus can protect the privacy of user data. However, during the federal training process, some of the devices fail to collect enough data for local training, while new devices will be included to the group training. This leads to an unbalanced global data distribution and thus af ect the performance of the global model training. Most of the current research is focusing on class imbalance with a fixednumber of classes, while little attention is paid to data imbalance with a variable number of classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Federated Semi-supervised Learning for Class Variable Imbalance (FCVI) to solve class variable imbalance. The class-variable learning algorithm is used to mitigate the data imbalance due to changes of the number of classes.

To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first ever to survey mobility-related federated learning solutions, such as traffic-flow prediction, next-location prediction, and point-of-interest recommendation. Our categorization is based on three main questions:\\n            Why use federated learning?\\n            to identify the motivation to use federated learning;\\n            What problems are being addressed?\\n            to examine problems that surface with federated learning and how they are solved; and\\n            How is federated learning implemented?\\n            to account for the solutions implemented by the authors surveyed The selected papers are peer reviewed and published in journals and conferences; they all adopt federated learning as their core approach. We introduce our conceptual model to characterize federated learning solutions and to compare them. In our conceptual model, we define three abstract roles: data generator, learner, and aggregator.

The technique’s inherent security benefits, privacy-preserving capabilities, ease of scalability, and ability to transcend data biases have motivated researchers to use this tool on healthcare datasets. While several reviews exist detailing FL and its applications, this review focuses solely on the different applications of FL to medical imaging datasets, grouping applications by diseases, modality, and/or part of the body. This Systematic Literature review was conducted by querying and consolidating results from ArXiv, IEEE Xplorer, and PubMed. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of FL architecture, models, descriptions of the performance achieved by FL models, and how results compare with traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Additionally, we discuss the security benefits, highlighting two primary forms of privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Finally, we provide some background information and context regarding where the contributions lie. The background information is organized into the following categories: architecture/setup type, data-related topics, security, and learning types. While progress has been made within the field of FL and medical imaging, much room for improvement and understanding remains, with an emphasis on security and data issues remaining the primary concerns for researchers. Therefore, improvements are constantly pushing the field forward.

However, it still demands a time-consuming and labor-intensive site survey and suffers from the fluctuation of wireless signals. To address these issues, we propose a prototypical network-based positioning system, which explores the power of few-shot learning to establish a robust RSSI-position matching model with limited labels. Our system uses a temporal convolutional network as the encoder to learn an embedding of the individual sample, as well as its quality. Each prototype is a weighted combination of the embedded support samples belonging to its position. Online positioning is performed for an embedded query sample by simply finding the nearest position prototype. To mitigate the space ambiguity caused by signal fluctuation, the Kalman Filter estimates the most likely current RSSI based on the historical measurements and current measurement in the online stage. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs better than the existing deep-learning-based models with fewer labeled samples.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23208458'}, {'id': 12, 'title': 'Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting for Few-Shot Spoken Word Classification Through Meta-Learning', 'authors': 'Ruan van der Merwe, Herman Kamper', 'published': '2023-8-20', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/interspeech.2023-385'}, {'id': 13, 'title': 'Few-shot learning using the median prototype of the support set', 'authors': 'Eu-Tteum Baek,  ', 'published': '2023-2-28', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Meta-learning is metacognition that instantly distinguishes between knowing and unknown.

As an important foundation, deep learning (DL) technology has achieved many successes in multiple fields. In addition, the success of deep learning also relies on the support of large-scale datasets, which can provide models with a variety of images. The rich information in these images can help the model learn more about various categories of images, thereby improving the classification performance and generalization ability of the model. However, in real application scenarios, it may be difficult for most tasks to collect a large number of images or enough images for model training, which also restricts the performance of the trained model to a certain extent. Therefore, how to use limited samples to train the model with high performance becomes key. In order to improve this problem, the few-shot learning (FSL) strategy is proposed, which aims to obtain a model with strong performance through a small amount of data. Therefore, FSL can play its advantages in some real scene tasks where a large number of training data cannot be obtained. In this review, we will mainly introduce the FSL methods for image classification based on DL, which are mainly divided into four categories: methods based on data enhancement, metric learning, meta-learning and adding other tasks. First, we introduce some classic and advanced FSL methods in the order of categories. Second, we introduce some datasets that are often used to test the performance of FSL methods and the performance of some classical and advanced FSL methods on two common datasets. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field.</p></abstract>', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2024029'}, {'id': 19, 'title': 'Weighted Prototype Network for Few-Shot Learning Via Graph Structure', 'authors': 'Yifan Zhou, Lei Yu', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4379715'}, {'id': 20, 'title': 'Few-Shot Learning for New Environment Adaptation', 'authors': 'Ouya Wang, Shenglong Zhou, Geoffrey Ye Li', 'published': '2023-12-4', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/globecom54140.2023.10437273'}, {'id': 21, 'title': 'Few-Shot Learning for CNN-based Animal Classification in Camera Traps using an Infrared Camera', 'authors': 'Koki Kishi, Masako Kishimoto, Sulfayanti F.

Existing few-shot methods rely on completely clean training data. However, in the real world, the training data are always corrupted and accompanied by noise due to the disturbance in data transmission and low-quality annotation, which severely degrades the performance and generalization capability of few-shot models. To address the problem, we propose a unified peer-collaboration learning (PCL) framework to extract valid knowledge from corrupted data for few-shot learning. PCL leverages two modules to mimic the peer collaboration process which cooperatively evaluates the importance of each sample. Specifically, each module first estimates the importance weights of different samples by encoding the information provided by the other module from both global and local perspectives.

While these methods have achieved successes in various scenarios, they commonly adapt all parameters of trainable layers when learning new tasks. This neglects potentially more efficient learning strategies for a given task distribution and may be susceptible to overfitting, especially in few-shot learning where tasks must be learned from a limited number of examples. To address these issues, we propose Subspace Adaptation Prior (SAP), a novel gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that jointly learns good initialization parameters (prior knowledge) and layer-wise parameter subspaces in the form of operation subsets that should be adaptable. In this way, SAP can learn which operation subsets to adjust with gradient descent based on the underlying task distribution, simultaneously decreasing the risk of overfitting when learning new tasks. We demonstrate that this ability is helpful as SAP yields superior or competitive performance in few-shot image classification settings (gains between 0.1% and 3.9% in accuracy). Analysis of the learned subspaces demonstrates that low-dimensional operations often yield high activation strengths, indicating that they may be important for achieving good few-shot learning performance.

In recent years, there have been significant advances in leveraging deep learning methods for noise reduction. Nevertheless, adaptation of supervised learning models to unseen domains remains a challenging problem. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained for computational imaging tasks are vulnerable to changes in the acquisition system’s physical parameters, such as: sampling space, resolution, and contrast. Even within the same acquisition system, performance degrades across datasets of different biological tissues. In this work, we propose a few-shot supervised learning framework for optical coherence tomography (OCT) noise reduction, that offers high-speed training (of the order of seconds) and requires only a single image, or part of an image, and a corresponding speckle-suppressed ground truth, for training. Furthermore, we formulate the domain shift problem for OCT diverse imaging systems and prove that the output resolution of a despeckling trained model is determined by the source domain resolution. We also provide possible remedies. We propose different practical implementations of our approach, verify and compare their applicability, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate the potential to improve sample complexity, generalization, and time efficiency, for coherent and non-coherent noise reduction via supervised learning models, that can also be leveraged for other real-time computer vision applications.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jimaging9110237'}, {'id': 47, 'title': 'Few-shot Fault Detection Based on Meta Learning

However, the success of deep models often relies on a large amount of annotated remote sensing data. Additionally, deep models are typically trained and tested on the same set of classes, leading to compromised generalization performance when encountering new classes. This is where few-shot learning aims to enable models to quickly generalize to new classes with only a few reference samples. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative self-supervised transductive few-shot learning (CS2TFSL) algorithm for remote sensing scene classification. In our approach, we construct two distinct self-supervised auxiliary tasks to jointly train the feature extractor, aiming to obtain a powerful representation. Subsequently, the feature extractor’s parameters are frozen, requiring no further training, and transferred to the inference stage. During testing, we employ transductive inference to enhance the associative information between the support and query sets by leveraging additional sample information in the data. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art few-shot scene classification algorithms on the WHU-RS19 and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS2TFSL. More specifically, CS2TFSL ranks first in the settings of five-way one-shot and five-way five-shot. Additionally, detailed ablation experiments are conducted to analyze the CS2TFSL.

However, the limited training examples make the models more vulnerable to label noise, which can lead to poor generalization capability. To address this critical challenge, we propose a curriculum meta-learning model that employs a novel dual-level class-example sampling strategy to create a robust curriculum for adaptive task distribution formulation and robust model training. The dual-level framework proposes a heuristic class sampling criterion that measures pairwise class boundary complexity to form a class curriculum; it uses effective example sampling through an under-trained proxy model to form an example curriculum. By utilizing both class-level and example-level information, our approach is more robust to handle limited training data and noisy labels that commonly occur in few-shot learning tasks.\\nThe model has efficient convergence behavior, which is verified through rigorous convergence analysis. Additionally, we establish a novel error bound through a hierarchical PAC-Bayesian analysis for curriculum meta-learning under noise.

Consequently, cybersecurity challenges have increased due to the natural diversity of the IoT, limited hardware resources, and limited security capabilities. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a substantial role in securing IoT networks. Several researchers have focused on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to develop intrusion detection techniques. Although ML is good for classification, other methods perform better in feature transformation. However, at the level of accuracy, both learning techniques have their own certain compromises. Although IDSs based on ML and DL methods can achieve a high detection rate, the performance depends on the training dataset size. Incidentally, collecting a large amount of data is one of the main drawbacks that limits performance when training datasets are lacking, and such methods can fail to detect novel attacks. Few-shot learning (FSL) is an emerging approach that is employed in different domains because of its proven ability to learn from a few training samples. Although numerous studies have addressed the issues of IDSs and improved IDS performance, the literature on FSL-based IDSs is scarce. Therefore, an investigation is required to explore the performance of FSL in IoT IDSs. This work proposes an IoT intrusion detection model based on a convolutional neural network as a feature extractor and a prototypical network as an FSL classifier. The empirical results were analyzed and compared with those of recent intrusion detection approaches. The accuracy results reached 99.44%, which shows a promising direction for involving FSL in IoT IDSs.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math12071055'}, {'id': 82, 'title': 'Towards Informative Few-Shot Prompt with Maximum Information Gain for In-Context Learning', 'authors': 'Hongfu Liu, Ye Wang', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.1060'}, {'id': 83, 'title': 'Retrieval-Based Prompt Selection for Code-Related Few-Shot Learning', 'authors': 'Noor Nashid, Mifta Sintaha, Ali Mesbah', 'published': '2023-5', 'citations': 14, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icse48619.2023.00205'}, {'id': 84, 'title': 'CON-GAN-BERT: combining Contrastive Learning with Generative Adversarial Nets for Few-Shot Sentiment Classification', 'authors': 'Qishun Mei', 'published': '2023-3', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icnlp58431.2023.00038'}, {'id': 85, 'title': 'Argumentative Stance Prediction: An Exploratory Study on Multimodality and Few-Shot Learning', 'authors': 'Arushi Sharma, Abhibha Gupta, Maneesh Bilalpur', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.argmining-1.18'}, {'id': 86, 'title': 'Attentive Cross-Domain Few-shot Learning and Domain Adaptation in HSI Classification', 'authors': 'Rojan Basnet, Rimsa Goperma, Liang Zhao', 'published': '2023-10-31', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tencon58879.2023.10322397'}, {'id': 87, 'title': 'Using Bidirectional Prompt Learning in NLP Few Shot Tasks', 'authors': 'Li Ding, Shiren Ye', 'published': '2023-3-22', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': \"Few-Shot Learning, a subfield of machine learning, aims to solve the problem of learning new tasks with only a small amount of annotated data. Compared to traditional supervised learning, Few-Shot Learning is more challenging because there are very few training samples available during the training process, which means that the model must learn quickly and generalize to new samples. Prompt learning is a recently emerged training paradigm in natural language processing, which can quickly leverage the language capabilities of large pre-trained language models to achieve fast start-up. Based on the prompt learning paradigm, this paper proposes to use its conjugate tasks to further enhance the model's ability in few-shot learning.

This study presents a visual integration model that uses a data-supported Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to generate creative design ideas.

One of the pivotal innovations within this domain is the emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs). These unique models have shown remarkable capabilities in crafting synthetic data, closely emulating real-world distributions. Notably, their application to gene expression data systems is a fascinating and rapidly growing focus area. Restrictions related to ethical and logistical issues often limit the size, diversity, and data-gathering speed of gene expression data. Herein lies the potential of GANs, as they are capable of producing synthetic gene expression data, offering a potential solution to these limitations.

In a typical GAN model, the generator and the discriminator are both improved by competing with each other. Therefore, in this highly competitive training process, GANs can easily run into trouble while they move towards the optimal solution. In most cases, the case of such instability arises from the loss function, or in other words, the gradient of the loss function. This research proposed a new set of GAN that replaces its objective function with supcon, or the supervised contrastive loss to solve gradient-related problems.

Nevertheless, designing an efficient and competitive training method is still a challenging task due to the cyclic behaviors of some gradient-based ways and the expensive computational cost of acquiring the Hessian matrix. To address this problem, we proposed the Adaptive Composite Gradients(ACG) method, linearly convergent in bilinear games under suitable settings. Theory analysis and toy-function experiments both suggest that our approach alleviates the cyclic behaviors and converges faster than recently proposed SOTA algorithms. The convergence speed of the ACG is improved by 33% than other methods. Our ACG method is a novel Semi-Gradient-Free algorithm that can reduce the computational cost of gradient and Hessian by utilizing the predictive information in future iterations. The mixture of Gaussians experiments and real-world digital image generative experiments show that our ACG method outperforms several existing technologies, illustrating the superiority and efficacy of our method.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00246'}, {'id': 1849, 'title': 'Predicting Ground Surface Deformation Induced by Pressurized Fractures Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks', 'authors': 'S.

In this work, we present a machine-learned model that is capable of predicting the surface tilt resulting from a pressurized fracture, using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). Fracture apertures along horizontal and vertical planes are given as input while surface tilt vectors are provided as output for the forward model. A 3D finite element model with discrete fractures is utilized as the Full Order Model (FOM) to create training data. The fractures are pressurized uniformly to induce a displacement at the ground surface. Images of the fracture aperture in XY and XZ planes, and surface tilt vector components (tilt X and tilt Y) are used for the training process. Three different loss functions are used, and the predicted tilts are compared to the real (FOM) tilts. The results show that the trained cGAN with Wasserstein loss and gradient penalty (W-model) can predict the ground surface tilt due to the pressurized fractures at variable dip angles.\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\nHydraulic fracturing has been frequently applied as a preconditioning method to promote normal caving behavior in mining operations.

In particular, the problem of inflated zeros has a great influence on text big data analysis. In general, the preprocessed data from text documents are a matrix consisting of the documents and terms for row and column, respectively. Each element of this matrix is an occurred frequency of term in a document. Most elements of the matrix are zeros, because the number of columns is much larger than the rows. This problem is a cause of decreasing model performance in text data analysis. To overcome this problem, we propose a method of zero-inflated text data analysis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and statistical modeling. In this paper, we solve the zero-inflated problem using synthetic data generated from the original data with zero inflation. The main finding of our study is how to change zero values to the very small numeric values with random noise through the GAN. The generator and discriminator of the GAN learned the zero-inflated text data together and built a model that generates synthetic data that can replace the zero-inflated data. We conducted experiments and showed the results, using real and simulation data sets to verify the improved performance of our proposed method.

Lotti', 'published': '2023-10-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"Abstract. Pose estimation from a monocular camera is a critical technology for in-orbit servicing missions. However, collecting large image datasets in space for training neural networks is impractical, resulting in the use of synthetic images. Unfortunately, these often fail to accurately replicate real image features, leading to a significant domain gap. This work explores the use of generative adversarial networks as a solution for bridging this gap from the data level by making synthetic images more closely resemble real ones. A generative model is trained on a small subset of unpaired synthetic and real pictures from the SPEED+ dataset. The entire synthetic dataset is then augmented using the generator, and employed to train a regression model, based on the MetaFormer architecture, which locates a set of landmarks. By comparing the model's pose estimation accuracy on real images with and without generator preprocessing, it is observed that the augmentation effectively reduces the median pose estimation error by a factor 1.4 to 5. This compelling result validates the efficacy of these tools and justifies further research in their utilization. \", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.21741/9781644902677-55'}, {'id': 1866, 'title': 'Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for Crime Scene Object Detection', 'authors': 'Uma N', 'published': '2023-8-23', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icaiss58487.2023.10250517'}, {'id': 1867, 'title': 'RegraphGAN: A graph generative adversarial network model for dynamic network anomaly detection', 'authors': 'Dezhi Guo, Zhaowei Liu, Ranran Li', 'published': '2023-9', 'citations': 6, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2023.07.026'}, {'id': 1868, 'title': 'Temporally Conditioning of Generative Adversarial Networks with LSTM for Music Generation', 'authors': 'Romit Mohanty, Pranjal Pratap Dubey, Tushar Sandhan', 'published': '2023-3-23', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/spin57001.2023.10117324'}, {'id': 1869, 'title': 'Limit Order Book Simulation with Generative Adversarial Networks', 'authors': 'Rama Cont, Mihai Cucuringu, Jonathan Kochems, Felix Prenzel', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4512356'}, {'id': 1870, 'title': 'Generating Synthetic Text using Generative Adversarial Networks', 'authors': 'Nisha Sahal, Ramkumar Krishnamoorthy, Navjot Singh', 'published': '2024-1-29', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icocwc60930.2024.10470722'}, {'id': 1871, 'title': 'Synthesizing credit data using autoencoders and generative adversarial networks', 'authors': 'Goran Oreski', 'published': '2023-8', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2023.110646'}, {'id': 1872, 'title': 'A generative model for Chinese character style fusion based on generative adversarial networks', 'authors': 'Lvqing Zhou, Zhiqiang Dong, Xiongkai Chen', 'published': '2023-10-20', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.3004721'}, {'id': 1873, 'title': 'An Overview of Generative Adversarial Networks', 'authors': 'Xinyue Long, Mingchuan Zhang', 'published': '2023-5-24', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Generative adversarial network (GAN), put forward by two-person zero-sum game theory, is one of the most important research hotspots in the field of artificial intelligence.

However, the convergence of the GANs should be granted mathematically with proper hyperparameters and some network structures. Considering the difficulties of constructing a large and clean dataset, GANs are required in many cases to extract enough information from a relatively small dataset. This could result in bad coverage performance of GANs, and one way to tackle this problem is pretraining. Since this method relies on importing external information from the pretraining dataset, this paper does a necessary discussion on the effect that the pretraining dataset has on the model and makes a simple assumption on the standard of choosing a pretraining dataset. Specifically, this paper focuses on the case where the target is to generate animation-style characters, and it has been proven that when providing a pretraining dataset with higher diversity, the performance of the GAN is better. The result of this paper should reveal the possibility that using a specially chosen pretraining dataset can improve the result of GAN.', 'keywords': '', 'link':

Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI’s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5× semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bdcc7030124'}, {'id': 321, 'title': 'A Survey of GPT-3 Family Large Language Models Including ChatGPT and GPT-4', 'authors': 'Katikapalli Subramanyam Kalyan', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4593895'}, {'id': 322, 'title': 'Chat GPT: From Natural Language Processing to Responsible AI - Implications, Challenges, and Future Developments', 'authors': 'Krish Bhanushali, Nirupam Gupta, Hardik Patel', 'published': '2024-1-15', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"This research paper provides a  comprehensive overview of Chat GPT, a cutting- edge natural language processing technology that  has rapidly gained popularity recently.

Chat GPT, a system developed by open artificial intelligence (AI), is the latest innovation that generates text in a human-like language format. It is considered to have learned the entire internet, enabling it to create responses containing almost accurate information in answer to the prompt provided by the user1. In this letter, we would like to discuss some key areas where chat GPT can play its role in medicine.\\nCancer is a global healthcare crisis where a vast amount of money is annually spent, search of cure and drug development. Improvements in cancer therapeutics have increased life expectancy, which has resulted in patients requiring extended support and monitoring thereby increasing the load of healthcare professionals. In this scenario, chat GPT based chatbots which are automated artificial intelligence tools that can serve as an intermediate element between doctors and patients. They can facilitate history taking, especially of sensitive and intimate details that patients might be shy of talking about. On the other hand, these chatbots could help in decreasing costs and burdens related to healthcare resources. It can also reduce the workload of doctors by reducing the number of minor consultations which can be done by the artificially intelligent chatbot and allow the resources to be directed towards more sicker patients who might need more attention and care2.\\nThe pandemic has made the world realize the importance of remote diagnostic systems, which are not only fast, reliable, and pocket friendly but have also increased access of healthcare to disadvantaged populations. NLP systems make use of linguistics analysis and deep learning to obtain vital information from a patient prompt detailing symptom, their onset, and demographic details (3). Chat GPT works via language processing can be linked to a text messaging system where the patient can provide their details and it would suggest possible diagnoses and recommend if the patient should visit a doctor or the symptoms would go away with home remedy/over-the-counter medications. This would be possible by training the algorithm on a larger set of medical data and human surveillance to improve efficacy over a period of time. This potentially would decrease the burden of primary care providers and benefit a larger population.\\n---Continue', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.47391/jpma.9558'}, {'id': 327, 'title': 'Demystifying GPT and GPT-3: How they can support innovators to develop new digital accessibility solutions and assistive technologies?', 'authors': 'Achraf Othman', 'published': '2023-4-30', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a neural network-based language model developed by OpenAI that has demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating human-like text and performing a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Methods: We generated 10 lung nodule descriptions for each of the 12 nodule categories from the Fleischner Society guidelines, incorporating them into a single fictitious report (n = 120). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were prompted to make follow-up recommendations based on the reports. We then incorporated the full guidelines into the prompts and re-submitted them. Finally, we re-submitted the prompts to a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model. Results were analyzed using binary accuracy analysis in R. Results: GPT-3.5 accuracy in applying Fleischner Society guidelines was 0.058 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.12). GPT-4 accuracy was improved at 0.15 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.23; P = .02 for accuracy comparison). In recommending PET-CT and/or biopsy, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had an F-score of 0.00. After explicitly including the Fleischner Society guidelines in the prompt, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 significantly improved their accuracy to 0.42 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.51; P < .001) and to 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.74; P < .001), respectively. GPT-4 remained significantly better than GPT-3.5 ( P < .001). The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model accuracy was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.55), not different from the GPT-3.5 model with guidelines included ( P = .53). Conclusion: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 performed poorly in applying widely known guidelines and never correctly recommended biopsy. Flawed knowledge and reasoning both contributed to their poor performance. While GPT-4 was more accurate than GPT-3.5, its inaccuracy rate was unacceptable for clinical practice.

These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India.\\n\\n\\nObjective\\nThis comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\nIn this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nIt was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/51523'}, {'id': 392, 'title': 'Analysis of a GPT-3 chatbot with respect to its input in a sales dialogue', 'authors': 'Julian Premm, Hagen Peukert, Dennis Rössel, Mareike Silber', 'published': '2023-9-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.15439/2023f3513'}, {'id': 393, 'title': 'PAC-GPT: A Novel Approach to Generating Synthetic Network Traffic With GPT-3', 'authors': 'Danial Khosh Kholgh, Panos Kostakos', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3325727'}, {'id': 394, 'title': \"Evaluating the Potential of Large Language Model AI as Project Management Assistants: A Comparative Simulation to Evaluate GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google-Bard Ability to pass the PMI's PMP test\", 'authors': 'Ali Vakilzadeh, Sara Pourahmad Ghalejoogh', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4568800'}, {'id': 395, 'title': 'Chat GPT and Intellectual Property Rights', 'authors': 'Anushka Sail', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4445275'}, {'id': 396, 'title': 'Application of GPT Models in English Language Teaching', 'authors': 'Leila Diasamidze, Teona Tedoradze', 'published': '2024-3-3', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.52340/lac.2024.09.15'}, {'id': 397, 'title': 'How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love AI: Analyzing the Rapid Evolution of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) and its Impacts on Law, Business, and Society', 'authors': 'Scott J.

To address this issue, we developed a novel data-driven approach to accurately predict CBGM values using personalized calibration and machine learning. First, we scientifically divided measured blood glucose into smaller groups, namely, hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL), nondiabetic (81–115 mg/dL), prediabetes (116–150 mg/dL), diabetes (151–181 mg/dL), severe diabetes (181–250 mg/dL), and critical diabetes (>250 mg/dL).

Early detection and treatment are crucial for successful outcomes. Breast cancer develops from breast cells and is considered a leading cause of death in women. This disease is classified into two subtypes: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have made it possible to develop more accurate and reliable models for diagnosing and treating this disease. From the literature, it is evident that the incorporation of MRI and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is helpful in breast cancer detection and prevention.

A novel mechanism of programmed cell death called cuproptosis is linked to the development and spread of tumor cells. However, the function of cuproptosis in BRCA remains unknown. To this date, no studies have used machine learning methods to screen for characteristic genes to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in breast cancer. Therefore, 14 cuproptosis-related characteristic genes (CRCGs) were discovered by the feature selection of 39 differentially expressed CRGs using the three machine learning methods LASSO, SVM-RFE, and random forest. Through the PPI network and immune infiltration analysis, we found that PRNP was the key CRCG. The miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB databases were then used to identify hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p as the upstream miRNA of PRNP, and the upstream lncRNA, CARMN, was identified by the StarBase database. Thus, the mRNA PRNP/miRNA hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p/lncRNA CARMN ceRNA network was constructed. This ceRNA network, which has not been studied before, is extremely innovative. Furthermore, four cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLs) were screened in TCGA-BRCA by univariate Cox, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analysis.

We identified seven metabolic pathways related to TC: Pyrimidine metabolism, Tyrosine metabolism, Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, Arginine biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, and Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The ML classifications’ accuracies were confirmed through 10-fold cross validation, and the most accurate classification was 87.30%. The metabolic pathways identified in relation to TC and the changes within such pathways can contribute to more pattern recognition for diagnostics of TC patients and assistance with TC screening. With independent testing, the model’s accuracy for other unique TC metabolites was 92.31%. The results also point to a possibility for the development of using ML methods for TC diagnostics and further applications of ML in general cancer-related metabolite analysis.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo14010011'}, {'id': 2042, 'title': 'Prediction of Fatty Liver Disease in a Chinese Population Using Machine-Learning Algorithms', 'authors': 'Shuwei Weng, Die Hu, Jin Chen, Yanyi Yang, Daoquan Peng', 'published': '2023-3-18', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'Background: Fatty liver disease (FLD) is an important risk factor for liver cancer and cardiovascular disease and can lead to significant social and economic burden. However, there is currently no nationwide epidemiological survey for FLD in China, making early FLD screening crucial for the Chinese population. Unfortunately, liver biopsy and abdominal ultrasound, the preferred methods for FLD diagnosis, are not practical for primary medical institutions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop machine learning (ML) models for screening individuals at high risk of FLD, and to provide a new perspective on early FLD diagnosis. Methods: This study included a total of 30,574 individuals between the ages of 18 and 70 who completed abdominal ultrasound and the related clinical examinations. Among them, 3474 individuals were diagnosed with FLD by abdominal ultrasound. We used 11 indicators to build eight classification models to predict FLD. The model prediction ability was evaluated by the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value. Feature importance analysis was assessed by Shapley value or root mean square error loss after permutations. Results: Among the eight ML models, the prediction accuracy of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was highest at 89.77%. By feature importance analysis, we found that the body mass index, triglyceride, and alanine aminotransferase play important roles in FLD prediction.

In this study, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were used to improve the image quality of mammography images and to detect suspicious areas. The main contribution of this study is to reveal the optimal combination of various pre-processing algorithms to enable better interpretation and classification of mammography images because pre-processing algorithms significantly affect the accuracy of segmentation and classification methods. In this study, the effect of combinations of different preprocessing methods in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions was investigated. All image processing algorithms used for lesion detection were used in the mini-MIAS database. In the first step, label information and pectoral muscle resulting from the acquisition of mammography images were removed. In the second step, median filter (MF), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and unsharp masking (USM) algorithms with different combinations of the resolution and visibility of images are increased. In the third step, suspicious regions are extracted from the mammograms using the k-means clustering technique. Then, features were extracted from the obtained ROIs. Finally, feature datasets were classified as normal/abnormal, and benign/malign (two class classification) using Machine Learning algorithms. Test performance measures of the classification methods were examined. In both classifications made in the study, lower classification performance values were obtained when the CLAHE algorithm was used alone as a pre-processing method compared to other pre-processing combinations. When the median filter and unsharp masking algorithms are added to the CLAHE algorithm, the performance of the classification methods has increased. In terms of classification success, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks showed the best performance.

To address these gaps, we developed a machine learning-based model that uses maternal characteristics and medical history to predict macrosomia.

In resource-limited countries like Ethiopia, the challenge is more severe. Low access to diagnosis and treatment due to the inadequacy of neonatal health professionals is one of the shortcomings. Due to the shortage of medical facilities, many neonatal health professionals are forced to decide the type of disease only based on interviews.

In most cases, it is the result of an infection with human papillomavirus or adenocarcinoma. This type of cancer is the third most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The risk groups for cervical cancer are mostly younger women who frequently change partners, have early sexual intercourse, are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), and who are nicotine addicts. In most cases, the cancer is asymptomatic until it has progressed to the later stages. Cervical cancer screening rates are low, especially in developing countries and in some minority groups. Due to these facts, the introduction of a tentative cervical cancer screening based on a questionnaire can enable more diagnoses of cervical cancer in the initial stages of the disease. Methods: In this research, publicly available cervical cancer data collected on 859 female patients are used. Each sample consists of 36 input attributes and four different outputs Hinselmann, Schiller, cytology, and biopsy. Due to the significant unbalance of the data set, class balancing techniques were used, and these are the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, the ADAptive SYNthetic algorithm (ADASYN), SMOTEEN, random oversampling, and SMOTETOMEK. To obtain the mentioned target outputs, multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are proposed. In this research, multiple classification algorithms such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and several naive Bayes methods were used. Results: From the achieved results, it can be seen that the highest performances were achieved if MLP and KNN are used in combination with Random oversampling, SMOTEEN, and SMOTETOMEK. Such an approach has resulted in mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC¯) and mean Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC¯) scores of higher than 0.95, regardless of which diagnostic method was used for output vector construction. Conclusions: According to the presented results, it can be concluded that there is a possibility for the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for the development of a tentative cervical cancer screening method, which is based on a questionnaire and an AI-based algorithm. Furthermore, it can be concluded that by using class balancing techniques, a certain performance boost can be achieved.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13021061'}, {'id': 2065, 'title': 'COVID-19 Detection Mechanism in Vehicles Using a Deep Extreme Machine Learning Approach', 'authors': 'Areej Fatima, Tariq Shahzad, Sagheer Abbas, Abdur Rehman, Yousaf Saeed, Meshal Alharbi, Muhammad Adnan Khan, Khmaies Ouahada', 'published': '2023-1-11', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading pandemic, and early detection is important to halting the spread of infection.

Currently, the coronavirus is identified via an RT-PCR test. Alternative solutions are required due to the lengthy moratorium period and the large number of false-negative estimations. To prevent the spreading of the virus, we propose the Vehicle-based COVID-19 Detection System to reveal the related symptoms of a person in the vehicles. Moreover, deep extreme machine learning is applied. The proposed system uses headaches, flu, fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, tiredness, nasal congestion, diarrhea, breathing difficulty, and pneumonia. The symptoms are considered parameters to reveal the presence of COVID-19 in a person. Our proposed approach in Vehicles will make it easier for governments to perform COVID-19 tests timely in cities. Due to the ambiguous nature of symptoms in humans, we utilize fuzzy modeling for simulation. The suggested COVID-19 detection model achieved an accuracy of more than 90%.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13020270'}, {'id': 2066, 'title': 'Using Ultrasound Image Augmentation and Ensemble Predictions to Prevent Machine-Learning Model Overfitting', 'authors': 'Eric J.

However, this requires predictive models that are generalized to handle subject variability as seen clinically. Here, we highlight methods to improve test accuracy of an image classifier model for shrapnel identification using tissue phantom image sets. Using a previously developed image classifier neural network—termed ShrapML—blind test accuracy was less than 70% and was variable depending on the training/test data setup, as determined by a leave one subject out (LOSO) holdout methodology. Introduction of affine transformations for image augmentation or MixUp methodologies to generate additional training sets improved model performance and overall accuracy improved to 75%. Further improvements were made by aggregating predictions across five LOSO holdouts. This was done by bagging confidences or predictions from all LOSOs or the top-3 LOSO confidence models for each image prediction. Top-3 LOSO confidence bagging performed best, with test accuracy improved to greater than 85% accuracy for two different blind tissue phantoms. This was confirmed by gradient-weighted class activation mapping to highlight that the image classifier was tracking shrapnel in the image sets.

Since continuous records of heart rate and activity levels are typically gathered, the data generated by these devices have a lot of promise beyond counting the number of daily steps or calories expended. Due to the patient’s inability to obtain the necessary information to understand their conditions and detect illness, such as depression, objectively, methods for evaluating various mental disorders, such as the Montgomery–Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and observations, currently require a significant amount of effort on the part of specialists. In this study, a novel dataset was provided, comprising sensor data gathered from depressed patients. The dataset included 32 healthy controls and 23 unipolar and bipolar depressive patients with motor activity recordings. Along with the sensor data collected over several days of continuous measurement for each patient, some demographic information was also offered. The result of the experiment showed that less than 70 of the 100 epochs of the model’s training were completed. The Cohen Kappa score did not even pass 0.1 in the validation set, due to an imbalance in the class distribution, whereas in the second experiment, the majority of scores peaked in about 20 epochs, but because training continued during each epoch, it took much longer for the loss to decline before it fell below 0.1. In the second experiment, the model soon reached an accuracy of 0.991, which is as expected given the outcome of the UMAP dimensionality reduction. In the last experiment, UMAP and neural networks worked together to produce the best outcomes. They used a variety of machine learning classification algorithms, including the nearest neighbors, linear kernel SVM, Gaussian process, and random forest. This paper used the UMAP unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction without the neural network and showed a slightly lower score (QDA).

Numerous studies have researched the relationship between sarcopenia and various risk factors, leading to the development of predictive models based on these factors. In this study, we explored the impact of physical activity (PA) in daily life and obesity on sarcopenia prediction. PA is easier to measure using personal devices, such as smartphones and watches, or lifelogs, than using other factors that require medical equipment and examination. To demonstrate the feasibility of sarcopenia prediction using PA, we trained various machine learning models, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), xgboost (XGB), lightgbm (LGB), catboost (CAT), logistic regression, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron, and deep neural network (DNN), using data samples from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among the models, the DNN achieved the most precise accuracy on average, 81%, with PA features across all data combinations, and the accuracy increased up to 90% with the addition of obesity information, such as total fat mass and fat percentage. Considering the difficulty of measuring the obesity feature, when adding waist circumference to the PA features, the DNN recorded the highest accuracy of 84%. This model accuracy could be improved by using separate training sets according to gender. As a result of measurement with various metrics for accurate evaluation of models, GBM, XGB, LGB, CAT, RF, and DNN demonstrated significant predictive performance using only PA features including waist circumference, with AUC values at least around 0.85 and often approaching or exceeding 0.9.

We performed a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) aimed to evaluate the use and performance of AI/ML models in detecting fetuses at risk of IUGR. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA checklist. We searched for studies in all the principal medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane). To assess the quality of the studies we used the JBI and CASP tools. We performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy, along with the calculation of the pooled principal measures. Results: We included 20 studies reporting the use of AI/ML models for the prediction of IUGR. Out of these, 10 studies were used for the quantitative meta-analysis. The most common input variable to predict IUGR was the fetal heart rate variability (n = 8, 40%), followed by the biochemical or biological markers (n = 5, 25%), DNA profiling data (n = 2, 10%), Doppler indices (n = 3, 15%), MRI data (n = 1, 5%), and physiological, clinical, or socioeconomic data (n = 1, 5%). Overall, we found that AI/ML techniques could be effective in predicting and identifying fetuses at risk for IUGR during pregnancy with the following pooled overall diagnostic performance: sensitivity = 0.84 (95% CI 0.80–0.88), specificity = 0.87 (95% CI 0.83–0.90), positive predictive value = 0.78 (95% CI 0.68–0.86), negative predictive value = 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.94) and diagnostic odds ratio = 30.97 (95% CI 19.34–49.59). In detail, the RF-SVM (Random Forest–Support Vector Machine) model (with 97% accuracy) showed the best results in predicting IUGR from FHR parameters derived from CTG. Conclusions: our findings showed that AI/ML could be part of a more accurate and cost-effective screening method for IUGR and be of help in optimizing pregnancy outcomes.

The application of various machine learning techniques that have appeared in the field of cancer diagnosis in recent years has provided meaningful insights into efficient and precise treatment decision-making. Due to rapid advancements in sequencing technologies, the detection of cancer based on gene expression data has improved over the years. Different types of cancer affect different parts of the body in different ways. Cancer that affects the mouth, lip, and upper throat is known as oral cancer, which is the sixth most prevalent form of cancer worldwide. India, Bangladesh, China, the United States, and Pakistan are the top five countries with the highest rates of oral cavity disease and lip cancer. The major causes of oral cancer are excessive use of tobacco and cigarette smoking. Many people’s lives can be saved if oral cancer (OC) can be detected early. Early identification and diagnosis could assist doctors in providing better patient care and effective treatment. OC screening may advance with the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. AI can provide assistance to the oncology sector by accurately analyzing a large dataset from several imaging modalities. This review deals with the implementation of AI during the early stages of cancer for the proper detection and treatment of OC. Furthermore, performance evaluations of several DL and ML models have been carried out to show that the DL model can overcome the difficult challenges associated with early cancerous lesions in the mouth. For this review, we have followed the rules recommended for the extension of scoping reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA-ScR). Examining the reference lists for the chosen articles helped us gather more details on the subject. Additionally, we discussed AI’s drawbacks and its potential use in research on oral cancer. There are methods for reducing risk factors, such as reducing the use of tobacco and alcohol, as well as immunization against HPV infection to avoid oral cancer, or to lessen the burden of the disease. Additionally, officious methods for preventing oral diseases include training programs for doctors and patients as well as facilitating early diagnosis via screening high-risk populations for the disease.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13071353'}, {'id': 2094, 'title': 'An intelligent SDN-IoT enabled intrusion detection system for healthcare systems using a hybrid deep learning and machine learning approach', 'authors': 'R.

Over 26 million individuals globally are affected by heart disease, and its prevalence is rising by 2% yearly. With advances in healthcare technologies, if we predict CHF in the early stages, one of the leading global mortality factors can be reduced. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to use machine learning applications to enhance the diagnosis of CHF and to reduce the cost of diagnosis by employing minimum features to forecast the possibility of a CHF occurring. We employ a deep neural network (DNN) classifier for CHF classification and compare the performance of DNN with various machine learning classifiers. In this research, we use a very challenging dataset, called the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) dataset, and a unique pre-processing technique by integrating C4.5 and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). While the C4.5 technique is used to find significant features and remove the outlier data from the dataset, the KNN algorithm is employed for missing data imputation. For classification, we compare six state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms (KNN, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT)) with DNN. To evaluate the performance, we use seven statistical measurements (i.e., accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, precision, Matthew’s correlation coefficient, and false positive rate). Overall, our results reflect our proposed integrated approach, which outperformed other machine learning algorithms in terms of CHF prediction, reducing patient expenses by reducing the number of medical tests. The proposed model obtained 97.03% F1-score, 95.30% accuracy, 96.49% sensitivity, and 97.58% precision.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics14070736'}, {'id': 2097, 'title': 'Machine-Learning-Based Diabetes Mellitus Risk Prediction Using Multi-Layer Neural Network No-Prop Algorithm', 'authors': 'J.

Such a disease is referred to medically as diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus can be categorized into three types, namely types 1, 2, and 3. When beta cells do not secrete enough insulin, type 1 diabetes develops. When beta cells create insulin, but the body is unable to use it, type 2 diabetes results. The last category is called gestational diabetes or type 3. This happens during the trimesters of pregnancy in women. Gestational diabetes, however, disappears automatically after childbirth or may continue to develop into type 2 diabetes. To improve their treatment strategies and facilitate healthcare, an automated information system to diagnose diabetes mellitus is required. In this context, this paper presents a novel system of classification of the three types of diabetes mellitus using a multi-layer neural network no-prop algorithm. The algorithm uses two major phases in the information system: the training phase and the testing phase. In each phase, the relevant attributes are identified using the attribute-selection process, and the neural network is trained individually in a multi-layer manner, starting with normal and type 1 diabetes, then normal and type 2 diabetes, and finally healthy and gestational diabetes. Classification is made more effective by the architecture of the multi-layer neural network. To provide experimental analysis and performances of diabetes diagnoses in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, a confusion matrix is developed. The maximum specificity and sensitivity values of 0.95 and 0.97 are attained by this suggested multi-layer neural network. With an accuracy score of 97% for the categorization of diabetes mellitus, this proposed model outperforms other models, demonstrating that it is a workable and efficient approach.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13040723'}, {'id': 2098, 'title': 'Specific Binding Ratio Estimation of [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT Using Frontal Projection Image and Machine Learning', 'authors': 'Akinobu Kita, Hidehiko Okazawa, Katsuya Sugimoto, Nobuyuki Kosaka, Eiji Kidoya, Tetsuya Tsujikawa', 'published': '2023-4-7', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'This study aimed to develop a new convolutional neural network (CNN) method for estimating the specific binding ratio (SBR) from only frontal projection images in single-photon emission-computed tomography using [123I]ioflupane.

Consequently, it is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Serum biomarkers historically correlate well with the early prognosis of post-surgical complications of PC. However, attempts to identify an effective biomarker panel for the successful prognosis of PC were almost non-existent in the current literature. The current study investigated the roles of various serum biomarkers including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL-8), procalcitonin (PCT), and other relevant clinical data for identifying PC progression, classified into sepsis, recurrence, and other post-surgical complications, among PC patients. The most relevant biochemical and clinical markers for PC prognosis were identified using a random-forest-powered feature elimination method. Using this informative biomarker panel, the selected machine-learning (ML) classification models demonstrated highly accurate results for classifying PC patients into three complication groups on independent test data. The superiority of the combined biomarker panel (Max AUC-ROC = 100%) was further established over using CA19-9 features exclusively (Max AUC-ROC = 75%) for the task of classifying PC progression.

As a formally structured language, logical statements are also more interpretable. They may be informally constructed in the form of a natural language statement, but a formalized logical statement is expected to follow a stricter set of rules, such as with the use of symbols for representing the logic-based operators that connect multiple simple statements and form verifiable propositions.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia3020049'}, {'id': 1043, 'title': 'Exploring Text-Generating Large Language Models (LLMs) for Emotion Recognition in Affective Intelligent Agents', 'authors': 'Aaron Pico, Emilio Vivancos, Ana Garcia-Fornes, Vicente Botti', 'published': '2024', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0012596800003636'}, {'id': 1044, 'title': 'Generating Data for Symbolic Language with Large Language Models', 'authors': 'Jiacheng Ye, Chengzu Li, Lingpeng Kong, Tao Yu', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.523'}, {'id': 1045, 'title': 'Practical PCG Through Large Language Models', 'authors': 'Muhammad U Nasir, Julian Togelius', 'published': '2023-8-21', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/cog57401.2023.10333197'}, {'id': 1046, 'title': 'Leveraging Fine-Tuned Large Language Models in Bioinformatics: A Research Perspective', 'authors': 'Usama Shahid', 'published': '2023-7-15', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Bioinformatics synergizes biology, computer science, and statistics and is further propelled by the integration of deep learning and natural language processing (NLP).

Such benchmarks do not examine the behaviour of LLMs in specific contexts. This is particularly true in the LGBTI+ context where social stereotypes may result in variation in LGBTI+ terminology. Therefore, domain-specific lexicons or dictionaries may be useful as a representative list of words against which the LLM’s behaviour needs to be evaluated. This paper presents a methodology for evaluation of LLMs using an LGBTI+ lexicon in Indian languages. The methodology consists of four steps: formulating NLP tasks relevant to the expected behaviour, creating prompts that test LLMs, using the LLMs to obtain the output and, finally, manually evaluating the results. Our qualitative analysis shows that the three LLMs we experiment on are unable to detect underlying hateful content. Similarly, we observe limitations in using machine translation as means to evaluate natural language understanding in languages other than English. The methodology presented in this paper can be useful for LGBTI+ lexicons in other languages as well as other domain-specific lexicons.

Aug-imodels use LLMs during fitting but not during inference, allowing complete transparency and often a speed/memory improvement of greater than 1000x for inference compared to LLMs. We explore two instantiations of Aug-imodels in natural-language processing: Aug-Linear, which augments a linear model with decoupled embeddings from an LLM and Aug-Tree, which augments a decision tree with LLM feature expansions. Across a variety of text-classification datasets, both outperform their non-augmented, interpretable counterparts. Aug-Linear can even outperform much larger models, e.g. a 6-billion parameter GPT-J model, despite having 10,000x fewer parameters and being fully transparent.

These datasets contain judgments of lexical properties like concreteness and age of acquisition, and can be used to norm experimental stimuli, discover empirical relationships in the lexicon, and stress-test computational models. However, collecting human judgments at scale is both time-consuming and expensive. This issue of scale is compounded for multi-dimensional norms and those incorporating context. The current work asks whether large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to augment the creation of large, psycholinguistic datasets in English. I use GPT-4 to collect multiple kinds of semantic judgments (e.g., word similarity, contextualized sensorimotor associations, iconicity) for English words and compare these judgments against the human “gold standard”. For each dataset, I find that GPT-4’s judgments are positively correlated with human judgments, in some cases rivaling or even exceeding the average inter-annotator agreement displayed by humans. I then identify several ways in which LLM-generated norms differ from human-generated norms systematically. I also perform several “substitution analyses”, which demonstrate that replacing human-generated norms with LLM-generated norms in a statistical model does not change the sign of parameter estimates (though in select cases, there are significant changes to their magnitude). I conclude by discussing the considerations and limitations associated with LLM-generated norms in general, including concerns of data contamination, the choice of LLM, external validity, construct validity, and data quality.

This is because well-fit task-specific language models (LMs) enable recognition that supports accurate scoring of pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, usage, and grammar (Bernstein and Cheng, 2023). ASR works well in these measurement tasks because measurement of word production, disfluencies, and pronunciation errors is not very sensitive to moderate differences in word-error-rate (WER) accuracy, and because speech-interactive tasks appropriate for reading instruction or L2 assessment elicit relatively predictable responses, for which task-specific low-perplexity ASR systems achieve sufficiently accurate speech recognition (Cheng and Townshend, 2003). In the work reported here, we compared the accuracy of two English ASR systems on a set of 718 extended spontaneous speech recordings from 77 adult non-native speakers of English speaking from six countries under uncontrolled recording conditions. A Kaldi-based ASR system with well-fit task-specific LMs achieved WER 17%, while USM, a general-purpose mSLAM recognizer with an RNN-T decoder, achieved 11% WER, which is a 34% relative improvement. The mSLAM\\u2009+\\u2009RNN-T technology will be briefly described and an analysis of results in three different open-response interactive speaking tasks will be presented.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0023275'}, {'id': 1501, 'title': 'A Survey of Natural Language Processing in Oil and Gas: Opportunities and Challenges', 'authors': 'M.

The power Internet of Things (PIoTs) has enabled UEN to transmit data increasingly frequently. As a result of flexible connections among various UEN networks, renewable energy increases its accommodation capacity considerably. Thus, the purpose of the study is to optimize UEN within the backdrop of PIoTs. According to the impact of PIoTs on UEN, this paper develops the combined demand response (DR) process and the layout of the important parts of UEN. Afterward, this study develops a bi-level economic dispatching process based on the cyber-physical systems of PIoTs and UEN. In the dispatching process, the higher level optimizes the total UEN function; the lower level optimizes the demand-side equipment output and combined DR. Then, the gray wolf optimization scheme is used to solve the bi-level dispatch. Lastly, the standard UEN and the practical network have been used to verify the efficiency of the suggested process.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/systems11080432'}, {'id': 2202, 'title': 'Retail analytics and firm profitability: How analytics can help retail companies be successful', 'authors': 'Faiyaad Chisis Mohammed', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"Objective: Literature suggests large data is a competitive advantage, and that features a firm 's general performance. With all the rise of big data (BD), e- commerce companies are making use of the resources to interact with much more with clients, provide much better items, moreover innovate far more to obtain a competitive edge. Nevertheless, past empirical studies show conflicting results. Design: Building on the capital based viewpoint as well as the firm 's inertia idea, we made a model to enjoy how BD as well as BD analytics capability influence innovation leads to e commerce companies. We completed a two year empirical investigation project to secure empirical data on 1703 data driven innovation duties from Asia and USA. Findings: We demonstrated that there's a tradeoff among BD as well as BD analytics capability, in that the maximum harmony of BD depends upon the quantity of BD analytics skill. BD analytics ability exerts a very good moderating impact, that's, the greater this capability is, the taller the outcome of BD on gross sales and margin growth. For U.S. development tasks, BD comes with an inverted U shaped connection with sales innovation. For Asian development responsibilities, when main details capital is very little, advertising big data analytics capability betters disgusting margin and sales innovation as much as a certain issue. Policy Implications: Establishing BD analytics capability with that time might stop development effectiveness. Our results provide instruction to e- commerce firms on creating strategic options regarding supply allocations for BD as well as BD analytics skill.

China might become more resilient to natural calamities by pouring more money into its transport network. Analyzing the relationship between China's degree of planned expansion and the country's current network of transport hubs can help with city development estimates. A wide range of factors were taken into consideration while evaluating China's dominance and the caliber of its transportation infrastructure. Using a geographical autocorrelation model and a coupling coordination model, the dynamic link between China's adaptability and the caliber of its transportation infrastructure is examined.Design/methodology/approachChina's northwest is underdeveloped in comparison to the southeast, which has a high level of resilience and development of its transportation infrastructure. The relationship between the levels of resilience upheld by China's transport infrastructure is suggested to be coordinated.FindingsThe authors find a positive geographical autocorrelation between the degree of coupling coordination and the degree of agglomeration, despite the fact that the distance between cities increases with time. They now believe that there is a connection between an area's population density and the degree of interspousal cooperation within. The consequence is an improvement in both national security and economic prosperity. The facilities for disaster management and transportation in China have received several proposals for improvement.Practical implicationsThe authors' Practical Implications suggests that scale inefficiency is a major contributor to the relatively poor efficiency of China's primary inland river ports. Different types of inland river ports may have vastly different water system efficiencies. Input and output congestion at China's important interior river ports has reached 51%, making it very clear that massive amounts of valuable port resources are being wasted.Originality/valueMany variables, such as climate and human error, affect the total amount of goods that can be moved via inner river ports. Ports situated either higher up or lower down the same canal may perform better or worse, respectively, depending on the circumstances.\", 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijrdm-02-2023-0113'}, {'id': 2204, 'title': 'The Impact of Data Analytics and Retail Metrices in Retail Industry: An Analytical Study', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-6-21', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.48047/jcdr.2021.12.02.101'}, {'id': 2205, 'title': 'A Case Study on HR Analytics Employee Attrition Using Predictive Analytics', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.52783/eel.v13i5.828'}, {'id': 2206, 'title': 'Towards the Creation of a Holistic Video Analytics Platform for Retail Environments', 'authors': 'Christian Daase, Daniel Staegemann, Anastasija Nikiforova, Victor Chang, Johannes Hintsch, Matthias Volk, Klaus Turowski', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0012148600003552'}, {'id': 2207, 'title': 'MMS Predictive Maintenance Big Data Analytics', 'authors': 'MD.

This has given rise to online retail platforms and the need for a better understanding of customer purchasing behaviour. Retail companies are pressed with the need to deal with a high volume of customer purchases, which requires sophisticated approaches to perform more accurate and efficient customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is a marketing analytical tool that aids customer-centric service and thus enhances profitability. In this paper, we aim to develop a customer segmentation model to improve decision-making processes in the retail market industry. To achieve this, we employed a UK-based online retail dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The retail dataset consists of 541,909 customer records and eight features. Our study adopted the RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) framework to quantify customer values. Thereafter, we compared several state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering algorithms, namely, K-means clustering, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), agglomerative clustering, and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH).

This need is particularly salient in light of a lack of comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines on ethics that address gaps voiced in LA ethics research. Studies on the topic are predominantly conceptual, representing mainly institutional rather than stakeholder views, with some areas of ethics remaining underexplored. In this paper, we address this need by using a case of four years of interdisciplinary research in developing the award-winning Early Alerts Indicators (EAI) dashboard at a distance learning university. Through a lens focused on ethical considerations and informed by the practical approach to ethics, we conducted a case study review, using 10 relevant publications that report on the development and implementation of the tool. Our six practical recommendations on how to ethically engage with LA can inform an ethical development of LA that not only protects student privacy, but also ensures that LA tools are used in ways that effectively support student learning and development.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18608/jla.2023.7743'}, {'id': 2212, 'title': 'Predictive Analytics by Integrating Google Analytics and Pega AI', 'authors': 'Praveen kumar Tammana', 'published': '2024-2-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"Purpose: This paper explores the transformative integration of Google Analytics and Pega AI in predictive analytics, highlighting its potential to revolutionize data-driven decision-making.\\r\\nMethodology: By harnessing Google Analytics' extensive user interaction data alongside Pega’s advanced AI algorithms, businesses can create predictive models with unprecedented accuracy.\\r\\nFindings: This integration facilitates enhanced customer behavior predictions, optimized marketing strategies, and improved operational efficiencies.

Most previous studies have ignored business intelligence systems (BIS), notably in the textile and apparel industry (T&A), in favor of looking at the larger picture of how big data would affect retail and distribution in a company. This is especially true for the T&As.Design/methodology/approach The authors report that they conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with 12 international luxury tourism service providers. In this case, researchers use snowball features and systematic techniques to select participants. A qualitative content analysis strategy is used to capture the focus of the interviews.Findings Problems with T&A company sustainability, opportunities to increase value creation via use of industry-leading business intelligence (BI) solutions and perceived roadblocks to BIS adoption were all found by the poll. Garment retail and distribution sector has benefited greatly from the increased use of Industry 4.0 technologies, especially those that provide better BI solutions. Determine the extent to which industry participation slows down or speeds up the process. The Company Information System (BIS) will help convince non-tech-savvy business owners of the financial, economic and environmental benefits of adopting certain technologies developed as part of the industry 4.0 movement.Research limitations/implications The authors of this research claim theirs is one of the first to investigate what variables affect the uptake of BIS, ultimately hoping to find out how BIS may be used by T&A businesses to tackle environmental issues through the use of Industry 4.0 technologies. The purpose of this study was to see whether BIS might aid T&A firms with their sustainability issues.Practical implications In the last several years, there has been a meteoric rise in interest in big data and business analytics among firms and educational institutions alike. This paper tries to introduce readers to the concept of business analytics in a way that is both academic and accessible, considering both the present and future of the field.

The significant growth witnessed in the digital transformation field and the new era of the industrial revolution 4 (IR 4.0), is a direct result of the need within the industry to utilize the large amount of data to make better decisions, improve operation strategy, plan better for preventive maintenance (PM), and process improvement.\\nThe uncertainty associated with estimating the incoming feed gas rate to NGL plants has resulted in deviation from optimal compressor recycle rate, missed opportunities of meeting planned PM and imposed urgency during operation. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, namely regression and decision tree model, the incoming feed gas can be predicted which result in the machine learning algorithms which results in the identification of the optimum number of running trains and recycle rate required for efficient operation.\\nNGL-Operation Planner (NGL-OP) is the outcome of utilizing ML algorithms which provides the ability of predicting incoming feed gas, identifying optimum number of running trains required as well as estimating the optimal recycle rate. Adopting this approach is a new and strategical way to plan NGL operation. The developed tool also has the ability to advise whether to shut down, maintain existing operation or starting-up a new train.\\nThe implementation of the model resulted in a significant improvement in NGL operation. The improvement includes fuel gas consumption reduction of around 449 MMSCF/Year which resulted in a significant cost saving, reduction in emissions around 27 M tons/year, and 10% reduction in operating unnecessary running trains. These savings have been achieved through the utilization of the NGL-OP to minimize uncertainty and improve our planning strategy.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/213290-ms'}, {'id': 2226, 'title': 'Predictive analytics for business', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-10-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.48047/ijfans/v11/iss7/333'}, {'id': 2227, 'title': 'An investigation of the COVID-19 impact on liver cancer using exploratory and predictive analytics', 'authors': 'Victor Chang, Rameshwari Mukeshkumar Patel, Meghana Ashok Ganatra, Qianwen Ariel Xu', 'published': '2024-6', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.health.2024.100309'}, {'id': 2228, 'title': 'SHAPING THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS MARKETING: UNVEILING THE POTENTIAL OF PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-11-19', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.56726/irjmets46344'}, {'id': 2229, 'title': 'A machine learning framework for predicting weather impact on retail sales', 'authors': 'H.

Despite the recognition of the importance of business analytics techniques for retail platforms, a systematic study of their operations is lacking in the literature. Based on our observations of the industrial practice and understanding of the academic literature, we attempt to address this gap by proposing a framework that broadly categorizes retail platform management into three key themes: demand-side management, supply-side management, and matching. For each theme, we identify critical topics, discuss the current practices of platforms, and review relevant literature. We also propose future research questions with directions for the initial modeling and solution strategy, together with applicable data sources and potential insights. At last, to facilitate future research, we provide a roadmap and datasets for further exploration of business analytics applications of retail platforms.

A growing number of manufacturing companies are searching for changes to improve their sustainability in the areas of products and manufacturing processes. These changes should be introduced in the design process and affect the whole product life cycle. This paper is concerned with developing a method based on predictive and prescriptive analytics to identify opportunities for increasing sustainable manufacturing through changes incorporated at the product design stage. Predictive analytics uses parametric models obtained from regression analysis and artificial neural networks in order to predict sustainability performance. In turn, prescriptive analytics refers to the identification of opportunities for improving sustainability performance in manufacturing, and it is based on a constraint programming implemented within a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The specification of sustainability performance in terms of a CSP provides a pertinent framework for identifying all admissible solutions (if there are any) of the considered problem. The identified opportunities for improving sustainability performance are dedicated to specialists in product development, and aim to reduce both resources used in manufacturing and negative effects on the environment.

The overarching feature of the majority of these research studies has been on the science of prediction only.

Although frequently underestimated in contemporary placemaking practices, this research emphasizes the role of the dual nature of plots as an element of urban form and an element of control over the retail landscape of the city. In this sense, the role of the morphological characteristics of plots in shaping the retail landscape of the city was investigated. The compositional (size, frontage ratio) and configurational (integration, betweenness, frequency) features of the plot in the HMA ( n = 77,736) were measured. Thereafter an unsupervised two-step clustering method was applied to reveal the subtle morphological regions through plot patterns. Computational plot characterization with open data sets yielded six plot types having different morphological characteristics and geographic distribution patterns. The spatial capacities of each plot type for retail distribution, agglomeration and diversity were then analysed and compared. This research argues that the interrelationship of the dual nature of plot plays an important role in placemaking processes. The results suggest that the spatial capacity of plots to accommodate street-based retail clusters is improved with spatially integrated, fine-grained urban fabric with independent micro-businesses involving a diversity of uses and actors.

Improving the operation of a commercial enterprise is an integral task of a growing business. In modern conditions of rapid global technological growth, systems of analysis and statistics come out on top in terms of efficiency. The introduction of a business management system through marketing and predictive analysis will allow you to stand out in a competitive environment and make the company more sustainable and competitive. The solutions currently available cannot solve the emerging business problems. These software solutions are often complex, require large amounts of raw data, and end up producing questionable statistics that cannot be further applied. Therefore, the whole business is faced with the task of finding and implementing simple but really working methods of analyzing activities and managing the development of an enterprise.\\r\\nMETHODS. It is proposed to use a business management system through marketing and analytics. Changes in the hierarchy of the enterprise will allow to unite all structural divisions with a single link, which will help to coordinate and direct the entire business as a whole. The next qualitative change should be called the introduction of a predictive analytics system, which will allow making decisions accurately and on time. Particular\\xa0importance should be attached to predictive analysis using the SALSA method. The simplicity and adaptability of this method of analysis will allow it to be implemented not only in large, but also in medium and small enterprises.\\r\\nFINDINGS. It is proposed to present the results of predictive analysis in a simple and understandable form to ensure clarity, comparability and the ability to quickly make the right strategic decisions. To improve the competitiveness of companies, it is proposed to change the structure of the business hierarchy and manage departments using statistical and analytical data obtained by the marketing department.\\r\\nCONCLUSION. Accurate data and strong interconnection of all departments in the company will be able to ensure stable operation, reduce costs, increase margins and competitiveness of the company. The introduction of a management system based on predictive analysis will help to avoid critical points in the work of the enterprise and respond in time to changes in the internal and external environment. High efficiency of work will help to enter new markets not only in Ukraine but also abroad.\\r\\nKEYWORDS: marketing; predictive analytics; business management; business efficiency.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.30857/2415-3206.2022.1.6'}, {'id': 2271, 'title': 'Predictive Analytics for Website User Behavior Analysis', 'authors': 'Pawan Vankhede, Sunil Kumar', 'published': '2024-2-24', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/sceecs61402.2024.10482298'}, {'id': 2272, 'title': 'Customer Churn in Subscription Business Model—Predictive Analytics on Customer Churn', 'authors': 'Boyuan Zhang', 'published': '2023-4-27', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'There is a growing tendency for more companies to develop towards a subscription business model. Under such a trend, it is important to learn about the customer churn rate within the business, learn from it and adjust business strategies accordingly. This paper aims to predict customer churn rate in subscription business models using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Through comparing the results from the different algorithms, the best algorithms can be identified so that it provides an insight on which algorithm a subscription business should choose in order to predict customer churn most effectively. In this work, a total of 21 features and 9 algorithms are taken into account. Through a set of rigorous procedure including data preparation, feature engineering, feature selection, model building, and finally, model evaluation, three algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting (SMOTE) and Neural Network outperformed other 6 algorithms. The best performing algorithm being Logistic Regression with its 79.6% prediction accuracy, thus the conclusion that when subscription business predicts customer churn rate, Logistic Regression is the most preferable algorithm. During the process of feature engineering, SMOTE did not improve the model performance as it supposed to, so it is not recommended during the model building process.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.54691/bcpbm.v44i.4971'}, {'id': 2273, 'title': 'Machine Learning-Based Predictive Analytics in Healthcare IoT', 'authors': 'Hariharan V, Sivaraman K', 'published': '2023-11-22', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iceca58529.2023.10395465'}, {'id': 2274, 'title': 'Reproducing Predictive Learning Analytics in CS1', 'authors': 'Denis Zhidkikh, Ville Heilala, Charlotte Van Petegem, Peter Dawyndt, Miitta Järvinen, Sami Viitanen, Bram De Wever, Bart Mesuere, Vesa Lappalainen, Lauri Kettunen, Raija Hämäläinen', 'published': '2024-1-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Predictive learning analytics has been widely explored in educational research to improve student retention and academic success in an introductory programming course in computer science (CS1).

Proactive risk reduction is essential for achieving this agility. To facilitate real-time risk prevention and improve agility, this research study proposes an innovative strategy that makes use of machine learning as well as predictive analytics approaches. Traditional supply chain risk management frequently uses post-event analysis as well as historical data, which restricts its ability to address real-time interruptions. This research, on the other hand, promotes a futuristic methodology that uses predictive analytics to foresee possible disruptions. Based on contextual and historical data, machine learning models can be trained to find patterns and correlations as well as anomalies that point to imminent dangers. Organizations can identify risks as they arise and take preventative measures by incorporating these models into a real-time monitoring system. This study examines numerous predictive analytics methods, showing how they can be used to spot supply chain risks. These methods include time series analysis and anomaly detection as well as natural language processing. Additionally, risk assessment models are continuously improved and optimized using machine learning algorithms, assuring their accuracy and adaptability in changing contexts. This research clarifies the symbiotic relationship among predictive analytics and machine learning as well as supply chain agility using a synthesis of theoretical discourse and practical evidence.

A recent addition to this toolbox of techniques is pulse-efficient transpilation, which reduces circuit schedule duration by exploiting hardware-native cross-resonance interaction. In this work, we investigate the impact of pulse-efficient circuits on near-term algorithms for quantum machine learning. We report results for two standard experiments: binary classification on a synthetic dataset with quantum neural networks and handwritten digit recognition with quantum kernel estimation. In both cases, we find that pulse-efficient transpilation vastly reduces average circuit durations and, as a result, significantly improves classification accuracy.

This field, called quantum machine learning (QML), aims to achieve a speedup over traditional machine learning for data analysis. However, its success usually hinges on efficiently training the parameters in quantum neural networks, and the field of QML is still lacking theoretical scaling results for their trainability. Some trainability results have been proven for a closely related field called variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). While both fields involve training a parametrized quantum circuit, there are crucial differences that make the results for one setting not readily applicable to the other. In this work, we bridge the two frameworks and show that gradient scaling results for VQAs can also be applied to study the gradient scaling of QML models. Our results indicate that features deemed detrimental for VQA trainability can also lead to issues such as barren plateaus in QML. Consequently, our work has implications for several QML proposals in the literature. In addition, we provide theoretical and numerical evidence that QML models exhibit further trainability issues not present in VQAs, arising from the use of a training dataset. We refer to these as dataset-induced barren plateaus.

Recently, ML (Machine Learning)‐based algorithms have acted as a handy diagnostic tool to identify whether a person is affected by thyroid or not.

Hence, the proposed system combines quantum computing with ML techniques to enhance computational power and precision. The system employs modified QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation) for feature selection since its searching performance is better than that of conventional PSO for selecting the optimum global position of the particle, thus selecting the relevant feature. Whereas, the QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machine) is implemented for more accurate classification than classical SVM, as it tends to capture complex patterns in data produced due to high dimensional feature space applied by quantum kernel functions. This combination of modified QPSO and QSVM tends to increase the performance accuracy significantly. The efficiency of the proposed model is measured based on derivative parameters, such as F‐1‐score, recall, precision and accuracy, with corresponding confusion matrix and ROC.

Through the lens of activation maps, we find that some important underlying physical principles and symmetries remain to be adequately captured for classifiers with even near-perfect performance. This explains why adversarial perturbations exist for fooling these classifiers. In addition, we find that, after adversarial training the classifiers will become more consistent with physical laws and consequently more robust to certain kinds of adversarial perturbations.

It is often the case that high accuracy in prediction using a ML model, demands a large and costly training set. Various solutions and procedures have been presented to reduce this cost. These include methods such as Δ-ML, hierarchical-ML, and multifidelity machine learning (MFML). MFML combines various Δ-ML like sub-models for various fidelities according to a fixed scheme derived from the sparse grid combination technique. In this work we implement an optimization procedure to combine multifidelity models in a flexible scheme resulting in optimized MFML (o-MFML) that provides superior prediction capabilities. This hyperparameter optimization is carried out on a holdout validation set of the property of interest. This work benchmarks the o-MFML method in predicting the atomization energies on the QM7b dataset, and again in the prediction of excitation energies for three molecules of growing size. The results indicate that o-MFML is a strong methodological improvement over MFML and provides lower error of prediction.

This research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the performance of known quantum–classical models, while having eight times fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters.

Most of them allow us to define quantum circuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitives depending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For most experiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a larger machine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowing different software packages, integrating them through the development of long code scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code often leads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growing proportional with respect to the program length.

Our innovative application of neural networks to the recognition of single-photon OAM Bell states not only circumvents the resource consumption and experimental difficulties associated with quantum light sources but also facilitates the study of OAM-based quantum information.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0149414'}, {'id': 544, 'title': 'Improving phishing detection in Ethereum transaction network using Quantum Machine Learning', 'authors': 'Anupama Ray, Sai Sakunthala, Anil Prabhakar', 'published': '2023-9-17', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/qce57702.2023.00125'}, {'id': 545, 'title': 'A quantum information theoretic view on a deep quantum neural network', 'authors': 'Beatrix C.

Now, a promising future application of quantum technology is considered to be quantum machine learning. We believe that the quantum classifier for SVMs using quantum kernels is one of the areas where quantum advantages can be demonstrated. At present, there are few examples of quantum classifiers applied to real problems in manufacturing processes. In this study, we aim to build a classifier that can demonstrate the quantum advantage and compare SVMs using classical and quantum kernels with conventional ResNet. Initially, a binarised image was generated after image pre-processing. After principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction were performed on the images, SVM with kernels was carried out. The kernel-based SVMs was then compared with the conventionally implemented Residual neural network (ResNet) using an evaluation index: F1-score. The results showed that the F1-score of SVMs using classical kernels was equivalent to that of Resnet. In addition, SVMs using quantum kernels showed higher F1-score than ResNet. In addition, the impact of the feature map and principal components of the quantum kernel was also investigated. It was found that when the feature map became more complex, conversely, circuit generation took more time. It was also found that the principal components are highly relevant to the image and cannot lead to simple results. In the future, we plan to accumulate more experimental data, look for scenes where quantum machine learning can be used and apply it to the manufacturing field. \\xa0', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.36001/phmap.2023.v4i1.3733'}, {'id': 547, 'title': 'A Classifiers Experimentation with Quantum Machine Learning', 'authors': 'Chaiyaporn Khemapatapan, Thammanoon Thepsena, Aomduan Jeamaon', 'published': '2023-3-8', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ieecon56657.2023.10126672'}, {'id': 548, 'title': 'Quantum-Improved Weather Forecasting: Integrating Quantum Machine Learning for Precise Prediction and Disaster Mitigation', 'authors': 'S Suhas, S Divya', 'published': '2023-9-15', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iq-cchess56596.2023.10391714'}, {'id': 549, 'title': 'A new quantum machine learning algorithm: split hidden quantum Markov model inspired by quantum conditional master equation', 'authors': 'Xiao-Yu Li, Qin-Sheng Zhu, Yong Hu, Hao Wu, Guo-Wu Yang, Lian-Hui Yu, Geng Chen', 'published': '2024-1-24', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'The Hidden Quantum Markov Model (HQMM) has significant potential for analyzing time-series data and studying stochastic processes in the quantum domain as an upgrading option with potential advantages over classical Markov models.

This work shows potential advantages, in terms of both performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical linguistics task—acceptability judgements.

We provide a first evaluation on the performance of these classifiers when using a hyperparameter search on six widely known and publicly available benchmark datasets and analyze how their performance varies with the number of samples on two artificially generated test classification datasets. As quantum machine learning is based on unitary transformations, this paper explores data structures and application fields that could be particularly suitable for quantum advantages. Hereby, this paper introduces a novel dataset based on concepts from quantum mechanics using the exponential map of a Lie algebra. This dataset will be made publicly available and contributes a novel contribution to the empirical evaluation of quantum supremacy.

Relevant results are presented by performing various methods viz. indexing and crawling and the output of these processes is the retrieved results that have to pass through the ranking process which is the central goal of information retrieval systems. The ranking is carried out through the classification or clustering of processed results which can include redundant and noisy features. The accuracy of classification or clusters for the ranking process can be maximized by removing noisy and duplicate features through the feature selection method. Although feature selection is an expensive computational process, after many decades, quantum computation tools are in use for many algorithms to implement realistic problems, particularly in the standard of Quantum Annealing. This paper focuses to prospect the standard of quantum computing in order to increase the quality of information classes through the feature selection method.

Unfortunately, these models do not protect the privacy necessary within commercial settings, prohibiting the use of potentially extremely valuable data by others. Encrypting the prediction process can solve this problem by double-blind model evaluation and prohibits the extraction of training or query data. However, contemporary ML models based on fully homomorphic encryption or federated learning are either too expensive for practical use or have to trade higher speed for weaker security. We have implemented secure and computationally feasible encrypted ML models using oblivious transfer enabling and secure predictions of molecular quantum properties across chemical compound space. However, we find that encrypted predictions using kernel ridge regression models are a million times more expensive than without encryption.

Quantum machine learning for real-world data has to handle extensive amounts of high-dimensional data. However, conventional methods for measuring quantum kernels are impractical for large datasets as they scale with the square of the dataset size. Here, we measure quantum kernels using randomized measurements. The quantum computation time scales linearly with dataset size and quadratic for classical post-processing. While our method scales in general exponentially in qubit number, we gain a substantial speed-up when running on intermediate-sized quantum computers. Further, we efficiently encode high-dimensional data into quantum computers with the number of features scaling linearly with the circuit depth. The encoding is characterized by the quantum Fisher information metric and is related to the radial basis function kernel. Our approach is robust to noise via a cost-free error mitigation scheme. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods for noisy quantum computers by classifying images with the IBM quantum computer. To achieve further speedups we distribute the quantum computational tasks between different quantum computers.

Because they are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, it takes a certain set of optimal conditions for their full potential to be exploited. For VQAs, the construction of an appropriate ansatz in particular is crucial, since it lays the ground for efficiently solving the particular problem being addressed. To prevent severe negative effects that hamper quantum computation, the substantial noise, together with the structural limitations, characteristic of currently available devices must be also taken into consideration while building the ansatz. In this work the effect of the quantum hardware structure, namely the topological properties emerging from the couplings between the physical qubits and the basis gates of the device itself, on the performances of VQAs is addressed. Specifically, it is here experimentally shown that a complex connectivity in the ansatz, albeit being beneficial for exploring wider sets of solutions, introduces an overhead of gates during the transpilation on a quantum computer that increases the overall error rate, thus undermining the quality of the training. It is hence necessary, when implementing a variation quantum learning algorithm, to find the right balance between a sufficiently parametrized ansatz and a minimal cost in terms of resources during transpilation. Moreover, the experimental finding allows to construct a heuristic metric function, which aids the decision-making process on the best possible ansatz structure to be deployed on a given quantum hardware, thus fostering a more efficient application of VQAs in realistic situations. The experiments are performed on two widely used variational algorithms, the VQE (variational quantum eigensolver) and the VQC (variational quantum classifier), both tested on two different problems, the first on the Markowitz portfolio optimization using real-world financial data, and the latter on a classification task performed on the Iris dataset.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42484-024-00144-5'}, {'id': 596, 'title': 'Machine Learning Approaches to Evaluating Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm Output', 'authors': 'Charles Woodrum, David Weeks', 'published': '2023-8-28', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/naecon58068.2023.10365987'}, {'id': 597, 'title': 'The State of Quantum Learning: A Comparative Review Towards Classical Machine Learning', 'authors': 'Tanvir M.

For example, deep learning models have been utilized to detect and classify malware. Deep learning, however, has vulnerabilities that can be exploited with crafted inputs, resulting in malicious files being misclassified. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) may be compromised by malicious files, which can have catastrophic consequences. This paper presents a method for classifying Windows portable executables (PEs) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To generate malware executable adversarial examples of PE, we conduct two white-box attacks, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) and Carlini and Wagner attack (C&W). An adversarial payload was injected into the DOS header, and a section was added to the file to preserve the PE functionality. The attacks successfully evaded the CNN model with a 91% evasion rate, whereas the RNN model evaded attacks at an 84.6% rate. Two defense mechanisms based on distillation and training techniques are examined in this study for overcoming adversarial example challenges. Distillation and training against JSMA resulted in the highest reductions in the evasion rates of 48.1% and 41.49%, respectively.

However, emotion recognition is a\\ndifficult task that requires understanding the context and sentiment of the texts. In this paper,\\nwe aim to compare the effectiveness of four recurrent neural network (RNN) models for classifying the emotions of Reddit comments.\\n\\n\\nMethods:\\nWe use a small dataset of 4,922 comments labeled with four emotions: approval,\\ndisapproval, love, and annoyance. We also use pre-trained Glove.840B.300d embeddings as\\nthe input representation for all models. The models we compare are SimpleRNN, Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We experiment with different text preprocessing steps, such as removing stopwords and applying stemming, removing negation from stopwords, and the effect of setting the embedding layer as\\ntrainable on the models.\\n\\n\\nResults:\\nWe find that GRU outperforms all other models, achieving an accuracy of 74%. Bidirectional LSTM and LSTM are close behind, while SimpleRNN performs the worst. We observe that the low accuracy is likely due to the presence of sarcasm, irony, and complexity in\\nthe texts. We also notice that setting the embedding layer as trainable improves the performance of LSTM but increases the computational cost and training time significantly. We analyze some examples of misclassified texts by GRU and identify the challenges and limitations\\nof the dataset and the models\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn our study GRU was found to be the best model for emotion classification of\\nReddit comments among the four RNN models we compared. We also discuss some future directions for research to improve the emotion recognition task on Reddit comments.

Although previous studies have shown that I depends on the statistics of the network’s connection weights, it is unclear how to maximize I systematically and how to quantify the flux in large systems where computing the mutual information becomes intractable. Here, we address these questions using Boltzmann machines as model systems. We find that in networks with moderately strong connections, the mutual information I is approximately a monotonic transformation of the root-mean-square averaged Pearson correlations between neuron pairs, a quantity that can be efficiently computed even in large systems. Furthermore, evolutionary maximization of I[x→(t),x→(t+1)] reveals a general design principle for the weight matrices enabling the systematic construction of systems with a high spontaneous information flux. Finally, we simultaneously maximize information flux and the mean period length of cyclic attractors in the state-space of these dynamical networks. Our results are potentially useful for the construction of RNNs that serve as short-time memories or pattern generators.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01651'}, {'id': 1455, 'title': 'Improved Recurrent Neural Networks for Text Classification and Dynamic Sylvester Equation Solving', 'authors': 'Weijie Chen, Jie Jin, Dimitrios Gerontitis, Lixin Qiu, Jingcan Zhu', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 3, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11063-023-11176-6'}, {'id': 1456, 'title': 'Motion Prediction Of Traffic Agents With Hybrid Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Vasileios Lagoutaris, Konstantinos Moustakas', 'published': '2023-6-11', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/dsp58604.2023.10167941'}, {'id': 1457, 'title': 'Fracture Estimation Based on Deformation History with Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Muhammed Adil Yatkin, Mihkel Kõrgesaar', 'published': '2023-12-15', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icmla58977.2023.00152'}, {'id': 1458, 'title': 'Algorithm for Mobile Robot Localization Based on Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18178/wcse.2023.06.029'}, {'id': 1459, 'title': 'Prediction of Deep Ice Layer Thickness Using Adaptive Recurrent Graph Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Benjamin Zalatan, Maryam Rahnemoonfar', 'published': '2023-10-8', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icip49359.2023.10222391'}, {'id': 1460, 'title': 'Comparisons of Stock Prediction Methods Based on Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'George Shao', 'published': '2023-2-28', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'These instructions give you guidelines for preparing papers for DRP.

To improve the performance of existing networks in time series forecasting, in this work two types of neural networks are brought together, combining the characteristics of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. This is a novel evolution that improves existing results in the literature and provides new possibilities in the analysis of time series. The results confirm a better performance of the combined BiLSTM-GCN approach compared to the BiLSTM and GCN models separately, as well as to the traditional models, with a lower error in all the error metrics used: the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the R-squared (R2).

The preprocessed data undergoes a two-level feature extraction (TLFE) procedure. In the first level, a ranked filter feature set technique is used to prioritize features based on medical expert recommendations. In the second level, a variety of metrics, including information gain, gain ratio, chi-square, and relief, are used to rank and select features. A composite measure guided by fuzzy logic is then used to select a judicious subset of features. The FERNN model uses the GRU-RNN to classify thyroid diseases in the databases.

The main reasons that place methane at the center of interest, lie in its high global warming potential (GWP) and its lifetime in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic processes, like engineering geology ones, highly affect the daily profile of gasses in the atmosphere. Should direct measures be taken to reduce emissions of methane, immediate global warming mitigation could be achieved. Due to its significance, methane has been monitored by many space missions over the years and as of 2017 by the Sentinel-5P mission. Considering the above, we conclude that monitoring and predicting future methane concentration based on past data is of vital importance for the course of climate change over the next decades. To that end, we introduce a method exploiting state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been proven particularly effective in regression problems, such as time-series forecasting. Aligned with the green artificial intelligence (AI) initiative, the paper at hand investigates the ability of different RNN architectures to predict future methane concentration in the most active regions of Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, by using Sentinel-5P methane data and focusing on computational and complexity efficiency. We conduct several empirical studies and utilize the obtained results to conclude the most effective architecture for the specific use case, establishing a competitive prediction performance that reaches up to a 0.7578 mean squared error on the evaluation set. Yet, taking into consideration the overall efficiency of the investigated models, we conclude that the exploitation of RNN architectures with less number of layers and a restricted number of units, i.e., one recurrent layer with 8 neurons, is able to better compensate for competitive prediction performance, meanwhile sustaining lower computational complexity and execution time. Finally, we compare RNN models against deep neural networks along with the well-established support vector regression, clearly highlighting the supremacy of the recurrent ones, as well as discuss future extensions of the introduced work.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences13060183'}, {'id': 1481, 'title': 'The Smart Intuitive Natural Language Understanding with Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'R Raghavendra, Megha Pandeya, Deepak Kumar', 'published': '2024-1-29', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icocwc60930.2024.10470796'}, {'id': 1482, 'title': 'Active Hypothesis Testing in Unknown Environments Using Recurrent Neural Networks and Model Free Reinforcement Learning', 'authors': 'George Stamatelis, Nicholas Kalouptsidis', 'published': '2023-9-4', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/eusipco58844.2023.10289731'}, {'id': 1483, 'title': 'Location Estimation of Moving Targets by Passive Sonobuoy and Recurrent Deep Neural Network', 'authors': 'Hooshang Abbaspour, Ghazal Najafi', 'published': '2023-10-23', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isncc58260.2023.10323838'}, {'id': 1484, 'title': 'Deep Learning for Marginal Bayesian Posterior Inference with Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Thayer Fisher, Alex Luedtke, Marco Carone, Noah Simon', 'published': '2024', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5705/ss.202020.0348'}, {'id': 1485, 'title': 'Recurrent Neural Networks for Solving Photovoltaic System Dynamics', 'authors': 'Md Rifat Hossain, Sumit Paudyal, Tuyen Vu', 'published': '2023-11-6', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isgt-la56058.2023.10328292'}, {'id': 1486, 'title': 'The Smart Improving of Translation Models Using Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Anjali Singh, Mayur Agarwal, Gowrishankar J', 'published': '2024-1-29', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icocwc60930.2024.10470485'}, {'id': 1487, 'title': 'A Deep Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit for CT Image Reconstruction', 'authors': 'Masaki Ikuta, Jun Zhang', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 5, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2022.3169569'}, {'id': 1488, 'title': 'Retracted: Prediction of IoT Traffic Using the Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network- (GRU-NN-) Based Predictive Model', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-12-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/9820840'}, {'id': 1489, 'title': 'Stability Analysis of Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay by Flexible Terminal Interpolation Method', 'authors': 'Zhanshan Wang, Yufeng Tian', 'published': '2024-2', 'citations': 2, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tnnls.2022.3188161'}, {'id': 1490, 'title': 'User2Vec: A Novel Representation for the Information of the Social Networks for Stock Market Prediction Using Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Pegah Eslamieh, Mehdi Shajari, Ahmad Nickabadi', 'published': '2023-7-1', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'Predicting stock market trends is an intriguing and complex problem, which has drawn considerable attention from the research community. In recent years, researchers have employed machine learning techniques to develop prediction models by using numerical market data and textual messages on social networks as their primary sources of information. In this article, we propose User2Vec, a novel approach to improve stock market prediction accuracy, which contributes to more informed investment decision making. User2Vec is a unique method that recognizes the unequal impact of different user opinions on specific stocks, and it assigns weights to these opinions based on the accuracy of their associated social metrics. The User2Vec model begins by encoding each message as a vector. These vectors are then fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate an aggregated feature vector. Following this, a stacked bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) model provides the final representation of the input data over a period. LSTM-based models have shown promising results by effectively capturing the temporal patterns in time series market data. Finally, the output is fed into a classifier that predicts the trend of the target stock price for the next day. In contrast to previous attempts, User2Vec considers not only the sentiment of the messages, but also the social information associated with the users and the text content of the messages. It has been empirically proven that this inclusion provides valuable information for predicting stock direction, thereby significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. The proposed model was rigorously evaluated using various combinations of market data, encoded messages, and social features. The empirical studies conducted on the Dow Jones 30 stock market showed the model’s superiority over existing state-of-the-art models. The findings of these experiments reveal that including social information about users and their tweets, in addition to the sentiment and textual content of their messages, significantly improves the accuracy of stock market prediction.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math11132950'}, {'id': 1491, 'title': 'Maneuver Prediction Using Traffic Scene Graphs via Graph Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks', 'authors': 'Petrit Rama, Naim Bajcinca', 'published': '2023-9', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': ' The driving process involves many layers of planning and navigation, in order to enable tractable solutions for the otherwise highly complex problem of autonomous driving.

As maneuver prediction is fundamentally feedback-structured, it requires modeling techniques that take into consideration the interaction awareness of the traffic agents involved. This work addresses this challenge by modeling the traffic scenario as an interaction graph and proposing three deep learning architectures for interaction-aware tactical maneuver prediction of the ego-vehicle. These architectures are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for extracting spatial features among traffic agents and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for extracting dynamic motion patterns of surrounding agents. These proposed architectures have been trained and evaluated using BLVD dataset. Moreover, this dataset is expanded using data augmentation, data oversampling and data undersampling approaches, to strengthen model’s resilience and enhance the learning process.

Although such synonymous codons do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, their selection can dramatically affect the expression of the resulting protein. Codon optimization of synthetic DNA sequences is important for heterologous expression. However, existing solutions are primarily based on choosing high-frequency codons only, neglecting the important effects of rare codons. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent-neural-network based codon optimization tool, ICOR, that aims to learn codon usage bias on a genomic dataset of Escherichia coli. We compile a dataset of over 7,000 non-redundant, high-expression, robust genes which are used for deep learning. The model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory-based architecture, allowing for the sequential context of codon usage in genes to be learned. Our tool can predict synonymous codons for synthetic genes toward optimal expression in Escherichia coli.\\n\\nResults\\nWe demonstrate that sequential context achieved via RNN may yield codon selection that is more similar to the host genome. Based on computational metrics that predict protein expression, ICOR theoretically optimizes protein expression more than frequency-based approaches. ICOR is evaluated on 1,481 Escherichia coli genes as well as a benchmark set of 40 select DNA sequences whose heterologous expression has been previously characterized. ICOR’s performance is measured across five metrics: the Codon Adaptation Index, GC-content, negative repeat elements, negative cis-regulatory elements, and codon frequency distribution.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe results, based on in silico metrics, indicate that ICOR codon optimization is theoretically more effective in enhancing recombinant expression of proteins over other established codon optimization techniques. Our tool is provided as an open-source software package that includes the benchmark set of sequences used in this study.\\n', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-023-05246-8'}, {'id': 1500, 'title': 'ODRNN: optimized deep recurrent neural networks for automatic detection of leukaemia', 'authors': 'K.

This paper addresses the challenge of learning such an agent under the scarcity of language annotations. One approach for leveraging unannotated data is to generate pseudo-labels for unannotated trajectories using sparse seed annotations. However, as the scenes of the environment and tasks assigned to the agent are diverse, the inference of language instructions is sometimes incorrect, causing the policy to learn to ground incorrect instructions to actions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised language-conditioned hierarchical skill policy (SLHSP) which utilizes unannotated data to learn reusable and general task-related skills to facilitate learning from sparse annotations. We demonstrate that the SLHSP that learned with less than 10% of annotated trajectories has a comparable performance to one that learned with 100% of annotated data.

The former contrasts local and global views while the latter uses masked prediction on multiple layered representations. In the latter case, supervised learning is employed to finetune a pretrained YOLOR object detector for detecting vehicle wheels, from which definitive wheel positional features are retrieved. The representations learned from these self-supervised learning methods were combined with the wheel positional features for the vehicle classification task. Particularly, a random wheel masking strategy was utilized to finetune the previously learned representations in harmony with the wheel positional features during the training of the classifier. Our experiments show that the data2vec-distilled representations, which are consistent with our wheel masking strategy, outperformed the DINO counterpart, resulting in a celebrated Top-1 classification accuracy of 97.2% for classifying the 13 vehicle classes defined by the Federal Highway Administration.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/eng4010027'}, {'id': 127, 'title': 'Goal-Conditioned Flexible Object Manipulation by Self-Supervised Learning from Play', 'authors': 'Keigo Ishii, Shun Hiramatsu, Yuta Nomura, Shingo Murata', 'published': '2023-11-9', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icdl55364.2023.10364471'}, {'id': 128, 'title': 'EMS2L: Enhanced Multi-Task Self-Supervised Learning for 3D Skeleton Representation Learning', 'authors': 'Lilang Lin, Jiaying Liu', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/116.00000022'}, {'id': 129, 'title': 'Renewable energy forecasting: A self-supervised learning-based transformer variant', 'authors': 'Jiarui Liu, Yuchen Fu', 'published': '2023-12', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2023.128730'}, {'id': 130, 'title': 'Self-Supervised Adversarial Imitation Learning', 'authors': 'Juarez Monteiro, Nathan Gavenski, Felipe Meneguzzi, Rodrigo C.

In this paper, we study the contribution of augmentation operators on the performance of self supervised learning algorithms in a constrained settings. We propose an evolutionary search method for optimization of data augmentation pipeline in pretext tasks and measure the impact of augmentation operators in several SOTA SSL algorithms. By encoding different combination of augmentation operators in chromosomes we seek the optimal augmentation policies through an evolutionary optimization mechanism. We further introduce methods for analyzing and explaining the performance of optimized SSL algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed method can find solutions that outperform the accuracy of classification of SSL algorithms which confirms the influence of augmentation policy choice on the overall performance of SSL algorithms.

Such reconstruction techniques exhibit nonlinear properties, which strengthen the need for a task-based measure of image quality. The Hotelling observer (HO) is the optimal linear observer and provides a lower bound of the Bayesian ideal observer detection performance. However, its computational complexity impedes its widespread practical usage. To address this issue, we proposed a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based model observer to provide accurate estimates of HO performance in very low-dose chest CT images. Our approach involved a two-stage model combining a convolutional denoising auto-encoder (CDAE) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine for classification. To evaluate this approach, we conducted signal detection tasks employing chest CT images with different noise structures generated by computer-based simulations. We compared this approach with two supervised learning-based methods: a single-layer neural network (SLNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that the CDAE-based model was able to achieve similar detection performance to the HO. In addition, it outperformed both SLNN and CNN when a reduced number of training images was considered. The proposed approach holds promise for optimizing low-dose CT protocols across scanner platforms.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering11040335'}, {'id': 172, 'title': 'Representation Uncertainty in Self-Supervised Learning as Variational Inference', 'authors': 'Hiroki Nakamura, Masashi Okada, Tadahiro Taniguchi', 'published': '2023-10-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/iccv51070.2023.01511'}, {'id': 173, 'title': 'Feature Decoupling in Self-supervised Representation Learning for Open Set Recognition', 'authors': 'Jingyun Jia, Philip K.

Recently, researchers have attempted to leverage the success of self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) in Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) to tackle time series representation. Nevertheless, due to the special temporal characteristics, relying solely on empirical guidance from other domains may be ineffective for time series and difficult to adapt to multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we review three parts involved in SSCL including 1) designing augmentation methods for positive pairs, 2) constructing (hard) negative pairs, and 3) designing SSCL loss. For 1) and 2), we find that unsuitable positive and negative pair construction may introduce inappropriate inductive biases, which neither preserve temporal properties nor provide sufficient discriminative features. For 3), just exploring segment- or instance-level semantics information is not enough for learning universal representation. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TimesURL. Specifically, we first introduce a frequency-temporal-based augmentation to keep the temporal property unchanged. And then, we construct double Universums as a special kind of hard negative to guide better contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce time reconstruction as a joint optimization objective with contrastive learning to capture both segment-level and instance-level information.

A few recent studies have demonstrated that the self-supervised learning is a promising solution to addressing insufficient labels of proteins, which is a major obstacle to effective protein representation learning. However, existing protein representation learning is usually pretrained on protein sequences without considering the important protein structural information.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nIn this work, we propose a novel structure-aware protein self-supervised learning method to effectively capture structural information of proteins. In particular, a graph neural network model is pretrained to preserve the protein structural information with self-supervised tasks from a pairwise residue distance perspective and a dihedral angle perspective, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the available protein language model pretrained on protein sequences to enhance the self-supervised learning. Specifically, we identify the relation between the sequential information in the protein language model and the structural information in the specially designed graph neural network model via a novel pseudo bi-level optimization scheme. We conduct experiments on three downstream tasks: the binary classification into membrane/non-membrane proteins, the location classification into 10 cellular compartments, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification into 384 EC numbers, and these experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\\n\\n\\nAvailability and implementation\\nThe Alphafold2 database is available in https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/. The PDB files are available in https://www.rcsb.org/. The downstream tasks are available in https://github.com/phermosilla/IEConv\\\\_proteins/tree/master/Datasets.

The researcher used a voice recorder during interviews, took photos, and recorded field notes. The data were analyzed according to the principles of informal inferential reasoning, which are generalizing beyond the data, using data as evidence for generalizing, and using probabilistic language whilst being aware of uncertainty. The findings indicate that young children are capable of making informal inferences from a sample space, describing event probability, and constructing bar graph and pie chart data representations.',

An efficient fault detection and isolation (FDI) system is paramount and should be capable of monitoring the health status of an aircraft. Historically, hardware redundancy techniques have been used to detect faults. However, duplicating the actuators in an UAV is not ideal due to the high cost and large mass of additional components. Fortunately, aircraft actuator faults can also be detected using analytical redundancy techniques. In this study, a data-driven algorithm using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed. The aircraft actuator fault investigated is the loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) fault. The aim of the fault detection algorithm is to classify the feature vector data into a nominal or faulty class based on the health of the actuator. The results show that the SVM algorithm detects the LOE fault almost instantly, with an average accuracy of 99%.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11020211'}, {'id': 1603, 'title': 'Predicting Coronary Artery Disease Utilizing Support Vector Machines: Optimizing Predictive Model', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-3-25', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'In the medical field, specialists aspire through the use of artificial intelligence to obtain accuracy in the results and details of patients. Such as automatic detection and prediction of diseases and obtaining medical results by applying artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning algorithms to clinical data. Therefore, because coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent types of diseases in the world and with the highest rate of injuries, one of the machine learning algorithms will be used in this research to diagnose this disease through artificial intelligence. Patient clinical factors were used, a data set of 303 people. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used and applied to the clinical factors of patients, which are 56 variables, as they are considered one of the most important clinical factors that can be used to detect CAD. This algorithm is considered to have good predictive ability in medical clinical characteristics. The Support Vector Machine algorithm model, which was used in this research, provided the highest prediction accuracy of (96.7%), with an AUC value of (71.5%). This indicates the effectiveness of the SVM algorithm in classifying the clinical patient data set that was adopted in this research. After applying it to the research data set, the SVM algorithm showed its ability to classify and predict well. The accuracy of the algorithm model was (96.7%). This indicates that this algorithm can help cardiologists in different ways during their daily practices to predict coronary artery disease, which is one of the most common heart diseases.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.58496/mjaih/2023/004'}, {'id': 1604, 'title': 'Least Squares Minimum Class Variance Support Vector Machines', 'authors': 'Michalis Panayides, Andreas Artemiou', 'published': '2024-1-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'In this paper, we propose a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-type algorithm, which is statistically faster among other common algorithms in the family of SVM algorithms.

It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in O(M4.67/&#x03B5;2) quantum circuit evaluations, where M denotes the size of the data set and &#x03B5; the solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values, which is only obtainable in theory. We prove under an empirically motivated assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in O(min{M2/&#x03B5;6,1/&#x03B5;10}) evaluations by employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos. Accompanying empirical results demonstrate these analytical complexities to be essentially tight. In addition, we investigate a variational approximation to quantum support vector machines and show that their heuristic training achieves considerably better scaling in our experiments.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-01-11-1225'}, {'id': 1608, 'title': 'Wear Parameter Diagnostics of Industrial Milling Machine with Support Vector Regression', 'authors': 'Teemu Mäkiaho, Henri Vainio, Kari T.

Yet, while the different data collection mechanisms might be effortless to construct, it is advised to have a well-balanced consideration of the possible data inputs based on the machine characteristics, usage, and operational environment. Prior consideration of the collected data parameters reduces the risk of excessive data, yet another challenge remains to distinguish meaningful features significant for the purpose. This research illustrates a peripheral milling machine data collection and data pre-processing approach to diagnose significant machine parameters relevant to milling blade wear. The experiences gained from this research encourage conducting pre-categorisation of data significant for the purpose, those being manual setup data, programmable logic controller (PLC) automation system data, calculated parameters, and measured parameters under this study. Further, the results from the raw data pre-processing phase performed with Pearson Correlation Coefficient and permutation feature importance methods indicate that the most dominant correlation to recognised wear characteristics in the case machine context is perceived with vibration excitation monitoring. The root mean square (RMS) vibration signal is further predicted by using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to test the SVR’s overall suitability for the asset’s health index (HI) approximation. It was found that the SVR algorithm has sufficient data parameter behaviour forecast capabilities to be used in the peripheral milling machine prognostic process and its development. The SVR with Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel receives the highest scoring metrics; therefore, outperforming the linear and polynomial kernels compared as part of the study.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11030395'}, {'id': 1609, 'title': 'Support subsets estimation for support vector machines retraining', 'authors': 'Víctor Aceña, Isaac Martín de Diego, Rubén R． Fernández, Javier M． Moguerza', 'published': '2023-2', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2022.109117'}, {'id': 1610, 'title': 'Efficient Image Registration Using Support Vector Machines', 'authors': 'Sachin Goswami, Anu Sharma, Prerna Mahajan', 'published': '2024-1-29', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icocwc60930.2024.10470766'}, {'id': 1611, 'title': 'Support Vector Machines: Spherical Separability: Limitations of Learning', 'authors': 'Garimella Ramamurthy, Tata Jagannadha Swamy', 'published': '2023-9-21', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icetci58599.2023.10331068'}, {'id': 1612, 'title': 'EEG-based Stress Detection using DEAP Dataset and Support Vector Machines', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.56452/6-3-673'}, {'id': 1613, 'title': 'Training Minimal Complexity Support Vector Machines with Multiple Kernels', 'authors': 'Shigeo Abe', 'published': '2023-10-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/smc53992.2023.10394217'}, {'id': 1614, 'title': 'On neural quantum support vector machines', 'authors': 'Lars Simon, Manuel Radons', 'published': '2024-6', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42484-024-00140-9'}, {'id': 1615, 'title': 'A Review on Low Complex Blind Video Quality Predictor based on Support Vector Machines', 'authors': 'Amitesh Kumar Singam', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4511324'}, {'id': 1616, 'title': 'Hybrid Quantum Technologies for Quantum Support Vector Machines', 'authors': 'Filippo Orazi, Simone Gasperini, Stefano Lodi, Claudio Sartori', 'published': '2024-1-25', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Quantum computing has rapidly gained prominence for its unprecedented computational efficiency in solving specific problems when compared to classical computing counterparts.

The MCCT was designed as a variable thickness form to study the influence of the materials distribution on the cross section on energy absorption. The energy absorption performance of the MCCT was investigated under impact condition with finite element simulation validated by a drop hammer test. Support vector machine, a machine learning technique, was used to predict the energy absorption performance and was further used for optimization of the MCCT. The results show that under the same mass, the MCCT with variable decreasing wall thickness (corners thicker than other regions) shows 4.81%, 30.67% and 37.70% improvement, respectively, in PCF, SEA and CFE, compared to the MCCT with variable increasing wall thickness (corners thinner than other regions). Moreover, the optimization results show that most samples in Pareto front lie in the region of tc > tm. These results all indicate that the MCCT with variable decreasing wall thickness performs better than with increasing wall thickness with regards energy absorption.

To address this, a novel method called Convolutional Neural Networks-Improved Support Vector Regression (CNN-ISVR) has been proposed for predicting the production line yield of aerospace engines. The method first divides the factors influencing production line yield into production cycle and real-time status information of the production line and then analyzes the key feature factors. To solve the problem of poor prediction performance in traditional SVR models due to the subjective selection of kernel function parameters, an improved SVR model is presented. This approach combines the elite strategy genetic algorithm with the hyperparameter optimization method based on grid search and cross-validation to obtain the best penalty factor and kernel function width of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function. The extracted features of production data are then used for prediction by inputting them into the improved support vector regression model, based on a shallow CNN without dimensionality reduction. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the CNN-ISVR model is evaluated using the three commonly used evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The model’s prediction results are then compared to those of other models.

Meanwhile in Jakarta, in 2022 there have been 14 cases of floods that caused hundreds of people to lose their homes. Several approaches can be taken to determine public opinion about flooding, one of which is text mining with an analysis of community sentiment. Sentiment analysis aims to determine public opinion regarding flood management in the capital city of Jakarta based on positive, neutral, and negative categories. To get the public sentiment, researchers carried out several stages, including the preprocessing stage. After obtaining public sentiment regarding flood management through the preprocessing stage, then classification is carried out based on public opinion so that it can be used by related parties for evaluation material in flood handling. In this study, the classification method used is the SVM method which is one of the supervised learning methods in machine learning. After classification, the next stage is the testing process using the K-Fold Cross Validation method. From the various sentiments obtained from Twitter data, it can be concluded that there are around 414 positive sentiments and 2464 negative sentiments related to flood handling in DKI Jakarta, while the results obtained from the test results show that the accuracy reaches 88.6%, the precision reaches 88.6% and recall reached 89.4%.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.33395/sinkron.v8i1.12063'}, {'id': 1683, 'title': 'Retracted: Design of a Regional Economic Forecasting Model Using Optimal Nonlinear Support Vector Machines', 'authors': '', 'published': '2023-7-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/9763031'}, {'id': 1684, 'title': 'A novel twin-support vector machines method for binary classification to imbalanced data', 'authors': 'Jingyi Li, Shiwei Chao', 'published': '2023-4-3', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Most existing classifiers are better at identifying majority classes instead of ignoring minority classes, which leads to classifier degradation.

The goal of the platform was to guide and balance the marble towards the center of the Stewart platform.

Two RL algorithms; Q-Learning and Actor-Critic were implemented to train the agent and to evaluate the performance in bridging the reality gap.

These highly complex software solutions must cover the high variability of use cases that might appear in traffic conditions, especially when involving scenarios with dynamic obstacles. Reinforcement learning algorithms are seen as a powerful tool in autonomous driving scenarios since the complexity of the algorithm is automatically learned by trial and error with the help of simple reward functions. This paper proposes a methodology to properly define simple reward functions and come up automatically with a complex and successful autonomous driving policy. The proposed methodology has no motion planning module so that the computational power can be limited like in the reactive robotic paradigm. Reactions are learned based on the maximization of the cumulative reward obtained during the learning process. Since the motion is based on the cumulative reward, the proposed algorithm is not bound to any embedded model of the robot and is not being affected by uncertainties of these models or estimators, making it possible to generate trajectories with the consideration of non-holonomic constrains. This paper explains the proposed methodology and discusses the setup of experiments and the results for the validation of the methodology in scenarios with dynamic obstacles.

This study utilizes the compiled experimental results obtained from stabilized and unstabilized specimens under repeated loading into a balanced, moderate-sized database. The efficacy of five ML models, including tree-ensemble and single-learning algorithms, in accurately identifying each specimen class was explored. Shapley’s additive explanation was used to understand the intricacies of the models and determine global feature importance ranking of the input variables. All the models could identify the unstabilized specimen with an accuracy of at least 0.9. The tree-ensemble models outperformed the single-learning models when all three classes (unstabilized specimens and specimens stabilized by triangular and rectangular aperture geogrids) were considered, with the light gradient boosting machine showing the best performance—an accuracy of 0.94 and an area under the curve score of 0.98. According to Shapley’s additive explanation, the resilient modulus and confining pressure were identified as the most important features across all models. Therefore, the proposed ML methodology may be effectively used to determine the type and presence of geogrid reinforcement in aggregates, based on a few aggregate material properties and performance under repeated loading.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40703-024-00206-4'}, {'id': 1942, 'title': 'Comprehensive Review of Benefits from the Use of Sparse Updates Techniques in Reinforcement Learning: Experimental Simulations in Complex Action Space Environments', 'authors': 'Martin Kaloev, Georgi Krastev', 'published': '2023-11-23', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ciees58940.2023.10378830'}, {'id': 1943, 'title': 'Using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Assessing the Consequences of Cyber Mitigation Techniques on Industrial Control Systems', 'authors': 'Terry Merz, Romarie Morales Rosado', 'published': '2023-2-28', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'This paper discusses an in-progress study involving the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to mitigate the effects of an advanced cyber-attack against industrial control systems (ICS).\\xa0 The research is a qualitative, exploratory study which emerged as a gap during the execution of two rapid prototyping studies.\\xa0 During these studies, cyber defensive procedures, known as “Mitigation, were characterized as actions taken to minimize the impact of ongoing advanced cyber-attacks against an ICS while enabling primary operations to continue. \\xa0To execute Mitigation procedures, affected ICS components required rapid isolation and quarantining from “healthy” system segments.

With regard to the RSA problem, it is expected that an algorithm that achieves better accommodation efficiency than conventional heuristic methods can be realized by applying reinforcement learning (RL), which well supports training in a simulation environment. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate three techniques devised to apply RL more effectively to elastic optical networks (EONs): two pre-processing techniques called link-axis positional encoding (LPE) and slot-axis positional encoding (SPE) and a post-processing technique named the assignable boundary slot mask. First, we build a simple model in which the state data of the optical network, including frequency slot utilization, are input to the neural network of the RSA agent in RL and show that this model has difficulty outperforming the conventional heuristic RSA algorithm. Next, we build an RSA agent model with the proposed techniques and simulate the accommodation of dynamic optical paths to quantitatively demonstrate that the blocking probability can be reduced by 17% compared to the conventional heuristic.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/jocn.503599'}, {'id': 1960, 'title': 'Farsighter: Efficient Multi-Step Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'authors': 'Yongshuai Liu, Xin Liu', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011800600003393'}, {'id': 1961, 'title': 'Intelligent Scheduling Based on Reinforcement Learning Approaches: Applying Advanced Q-Learning and State–Action–Reward–State–Action Reinforcement Learning Models for the Optimisation of Job Shop Scheduling Problems', 'authors': 'Atefeh Momenikorbekandi, Maysam Abbod', 'published': '2023-11-23', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'Flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSPs) have attracted significant research interest because they can considerably increase production efficiency in terms of energy, cost and time; they are considered the main part of the manufacturing systems which frequently need to be resolved to manage the variations in production requirements.

FJSPs are challenging to resolve and are considered non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard) problems. Numerous algorithms have been used previously to solve FJSPs. However, because their key parameters cannot be effectively changed dynamically throughout the computation process, the effectiveness and quality of the solutions fail to meet production standards. Consequently, in this research, developed RL models are presented. The efficacy and benefits of the suggested SARSA method for solving FJSPs are shown by extensive computer testing and comparisons.

Industry 4.0 is increasing productivity and efficiency in manufacturing through automation, data exchange, and the integration of new technologies. Innovative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics are smartly automating manufacturing processes and integrating data with production systems to monitor and analyze production data in real time and optimize factory operations. A digital twin is a digital model of a physical product or process in the real world. It is built on data and real-time information collected through sensors and accurately simulates the behavior and performance of a real-world manufacturing floor. With a digital twin, one can leverage data at every stage of product design, development, manufacturing, and maintenance to predict, solve, and optimize problems. First, we defined an RL environment, modeled it, and validated its ability to simulate a real physical system. Subsequently, we introduced a method to calculate reward signals and apply them to the environment to ensure the alignment of the behavior of the RL agent with the task objective. Traditional approaches use simple reward functions to tune the behavior of reinforcement learning agents. These approaches issue rewards according to predefined rules and often use reward signals that are unrelated to the task goal. However, in this study, the reward signal calculation method was modified to consider the task goal and the characteristics of the physical system and calculate more realistic and meaningful rewards. This method reflects the complex interactions and constraints that occur during the optimization process of the storage device and generates more accurate episodes of reinforcement learning in agent behavior. Unlike the traditional simple reward function, this reflects the complexity and realism of the storage optimization task, making the reward more sophisticated and effective.The stocker simulation model was used to validate the effectiveness of RL. The model is a storage device that simulates logistics in a manufacturing production area. The results revealed that RL is a useful tool for automating and optimizing complex logistics systems, increasing the applicability of RL in logistics. We proposed a novel method for creating an agent through learning using the proximal policy optimization algorithm, and the agent was optimized by configuring various learning options.

In this study, we integrate improved reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to enhance existing unmanned aerial vehicle inertial navigation technology and introduce a modulated mechanism (MM) for adjusting the state of the intelligent agent in an innovative manner [1,2]. Through interaction with the environment, the intelligent machine can learn more effective navigation strategies [3]. The ultimate goal is to provide a foundation for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles during flight and improve navigation accuracy and robustness. We first define appropriate state representation and action space, and then design an adjustment mechanism based on the actions selected by the intelligent agent. The adjustment mechanism outputs the next state and reward value of the agent. Additionally, the adjustment mechanism calculates the error between the adjusted state and the unadjusted state. Furthermore, the intelligent agent stores the acquired experience samples containing states and reward values in a buffer and replays the experiences during each iteration to learn the dynamic characteristics of the environment. We name the improved algorithm as the DQM algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the intelligent agent using our proposed algorithm effectively reduces the accumulated errors of inertial navigation in dynamic environments. Although our research provides a basis for achieving autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles, there is still room for significant optimization. Further research can include testing unmanned aerial vehicles in simulated environments, testing unmanned aerial vehicles in realworld environments, optimizing the design of reward functions, improving the algorithm workflow to enhance convergence speed and performance, and enhancing the algorithm's generalization ability. It has been proven that by integrating reinforcement learning algorithms, unmanned aerial vehicles can achieve autonomous navigation, thereby improving navigation accuracy and robustness in dynamic and changing environments [4].

With curriculum learning, we gradually increase the complexity of the environment and we find that it has a positive effect on the expected reward of a traversal. We see that the number of training steps needed for the two quantum approaches is lower than that needed for the classical approach.', 'keywords': '', 'link':

This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based technique for optimizing energy consumption and its associated costs, with a focus on energy management systems. A three-step approach for the efficient management of charging cycles in energy storage units within buildings is presented combining RL with prior knowledge. A unique strategy is adopted: clustering building load curves to discern typical energy consumption patterns, embedding domain knowledge into the learning algorithm to refine the agent’s action space and predicting of future observations to make real-time decisions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method using real-world data. It enables controlled exploration and efficient training of Energy Management System (EMS) agents.

Therefore, every day, new research contributions are posted, for instance, to the arXiv repository. Hence, it is rather difficult to capture the current “state of the field” and thus, to enter it. This brought the id-art NLP techniques to analyse the NLP-focused literature.

However, the leakage inductance and distributed capacitance of high frequency transformer can not only cause resonance, but also lead to transient changes of voltage and current in high frequency, which can lead to voltage spike, so that the switch tube is damaged. For transformers with the same output power, high-frequency transformers are much smaller and have lower calorific value than low-frequency transformers. Therefore, at present, many consumer electronics and network product power adapters are switching power supplies, and the internal high-frequency transformer is the most important component of switching power supplies. The basic principle is to turn the input alternating current into DC first, and then turn it into high frequency through a transistor or FET, etc., through a high-frequency transformer to change voltage, and then rectify the output again, plus other control parts, and stabilize the output DC voltage. In this thesis, we choose a more rational and cost effective winding structure, choose a more appropriate core material based on the comparison of different core materials, research on the insulation and cooling properties of transformer so as to improve the insulation properties of the transformer, make it safer and more efficient. The study has important significance to decrease the power loss of high frequency transformer and decrease the size of high frequency transformer.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.54254/2755-2721/10/20230174'}, {'id': 2434, 'title': 'Transformer-based Hebrew NLP models for Short Answer Scoring in Biology', 'authors': 'Abigail Gurin Schleifer, Beata Beigman Klebanov, Moriah Ariely, Giora Alexandron', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.bea-1.46'}, {'id': 2435, 'title': 'Voicemail Urgency Detection Using Context Dependent and Independent NLP Techniques', 'authors': 'Asma Trabelsi, Séverine Soussilane, Emmanuel Helbert', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011685800003393'}, {'id': 2436, 'title': 'PyTAIL: An Open Source Tool for Interactive and Incremental Learning of NLP Models with Human in the Loop for Online Data', 'authors': 'Shubhanshu Mishra, Jana Diesner', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.nlposs-1.22'}, {'id': 2437, 'title': 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Code in Python', 'authors': '', 'published': '2024-3-1', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.48047/resmil.v9i1.24'}, {'id': 2438, 'title': 'Unveiling the Power of Pre - Trained Language Models in NLP Applications', 'authors': 'Shrinath Pai', 'published': '2023-11-5', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.21275/sr231115202502'}, {'id': 2439, 'title': 'Improving NLP Model Performance on Small Educational Data Sets Using Self-Augmentation', 'authors': 'Keith Cochran, Clayton Cohn, Peter Hastings', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 1, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0011857200003470'}, {'id': 2440, 'title': 'Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers for Flexible Efficient Inference', 'authors': 'Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.findings-acl.664'}, {'id': 2441, 'title': 'Türkçe Duygu Sınıflandırma İçin Transformers Tabanlı Mimarilerin Karşılaştırılmalı Analizi', 'authors': 'Mehmet ARZU, Murat AYDOĞAN', 'published': '2023-8-26', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'Transformers tabanlı ile duygu sınıflandırma, son zamanlarda doğal dil işleme ve makine öğrenmesi alanında yaygın olarak çalışılan bir konudur.

Computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used to visualize the kidneys and identify abnormalities such as cysts, tumors, and stones.

Deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in improving the accuracy and speed of medical image analysis. In this study, we present a CNN-based model to accurately classify CT images of the kidney into four categories: Normal, Cyst, Tumor, and Stone, using the CT KIDNEY DATASET. The proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.84% on the test set, with a precision of 0.9964, a recall of 0.9986, and a F1-score of 0.9975 for all categories. The model was able to accurately classify all images in the test set, indicating its high accuracy in identifying abnormalities in CT images of the kidney. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of deep learning models based on CNNs in accurately classifying CT images of the kidney, which could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment outcomes for patients.

A considerable amount of work in this sub-field is concerned with prediction of typological features, for example, for databases such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) or Grambank. Prediction is argued to be useful either because (1) it allows for obtaining feature values for relatively undocumented languages, alleviating the sparseness in WALS, in turn argued to be useful for both NLP and linguistics; and (2) it allows us to probe models to see whether or not these typological features are encapsulated in, for example, language representations. In this article, we present a critical stance concerning prediction of typological features, investigating to what extent this line of research is aligned with purported needs—both from the perspective of NLP practitioners, and perhaps more importantly, from the perspective of linguists specialized in typology and language documentation. We provide evidence that this line of research in its current state suffers from a lack of interdisciplinary alignment. Based on an extensive survey of the linguistic typology community, we present concrete recommendations for future research in order to improve this alignment between linguists and NLP researchers, beyond the scope of typological feature prediction.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00498'}, {'id': 2491, 'title': 'Using Ensemble Learning in Language Variety Identification', 'authors': 'Mihaela Gaman', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.vardial-1.23'}, {'id': 2492, 'title': 'Multilingual Automatic Extraction of Linguistic Data from Grammars', 'authors': 'Albert Kornilov', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.fieldmatters-1.10'}, {'id': 2493, 'title': 'A Review of Text Summarization Techniques Using NLP', 'authors': 'Kartik Aggarwal', 'published': '2023-10-14', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': \"Techniques that employ natural language processing (NLP), often known as text summarizing, automatically construct summaries of extensive texts.

On the other hand, in abstractive summarization, a summary is generated that is clear, short, and accurate in its representation of the text's primary concepts. NLP methods like sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and semantic analysis are used in generating a summary from a text and locating and extracting relevant information from the text.

However, these studies need to analyze further the imbalance in their dataset. Our research aim is to create an airplane failure prediction by bird strike using a machine learning method optimized using GA feature selection. GA feature selection uses AUC maximization as the objective function to tackle imbalance problems in the bird strike dataset. First, we obtained the airplane bird strike dataset from Kaggle. We carry out preprocessing on the dataset.We then compared and chose one of four stateof-the-art machine learning methods: SVM, MLP, logistic regression, and random forest. The selection process involves oversampling methods, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and optimum threshold selection, which involves geometric mean (g- mean) and area under curve (AUC) values. Finally, we optimize airplane failure prediction by performing AUC maximization using GA feature selection. Our test results show that random forest is the best machinelearning method in airplane failure prediction compared to SVM, logistic regression, and MLP. SMOTE can increase random forest AUC from 0.845 to 0.878. Finally, the random forest model from ImbGAFS is better than the conventional method without feature selection. The increase in the AUC value is from 0.878 to 0.889. Then, after carrying out optimal threshold selection, ImbGAFS+random forest also has better sensitivity, specificity, and g-mean than conventional methods. The increase is from 0.7737, 0.8350, and 0.8037 to 0.8033, 0.8301, and 0.8166, respectively.', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5121/csit.2023.131614'}, {'id': 2500, 'title': 'NormNet: Normalize Noun Phrases for More Robust NLP', 'authors': 'Minlong Peng, Mingming Sun', 'published': '2023', 'citations': 0, 'abstract': 'No Abstract or Keywords available', 'keywords': '', 'link': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.findings-acl.136'}]\n",

    "### Step-4: Building and Visualizing the TF-IDF Vector Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook section covers the process of building a TF-IDF vector model from a set of preprocessed article titles, reducing the dimensionality of this model using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and visualizing the resulting lower-dimensional representation in 3D. The goal is to understand the semantic structure of the dataset by identifying clusters and variances in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Convert the text data into a numerical format that reflects the importance of words within the documents and across the document set.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use `TfidfVectorizer` from sklearn, which transforms the text into a sparse matrix of TF-IDF features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Reduce the high-dimensional TF-IDF vectors into three principal components to simplify visualization and analysis.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Apply `PCA` from sklearn, which projects the TF-IDF vectors onto the directions of maximum variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization of PCA Results**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Visualize the distribution of articles in the three-dimensional space formed by the principal components.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Use matplotlib to create a 3D scatter plot, where each point represents an article and its position is determined by its PCA-transformed TF-IDF vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Component Labeling**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Identify and label the principal components with the terms that are most influential in each dimension.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Analyze the PCA components to determine the top contributing terms and use these terms as labels for the axes of the 3D plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output Dimension of the TF-IDF Matrix**:\n",
    "   - **Objective**: Provide insights into the scale of the text data transformation.\n",
    "   - **Method**: Print the shape of the TF-IDF matrix to understand the number of documents and features (unique terms) processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach not only elucidates the thematic structure of the data but also assists in identifying key terms that characterize the dimensions of variation among articles. By visualizing these dimensions, we can intuitively grasp the relationships and distinctions within the document set.\n"
