        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe structure and performance of neural networks are intimately connected, and by use of evolutionary algorithms, neural network structures optimally adapted to a given task can be explored. Guiding such neuroevolution with additional objectives related to network structure has been shown to improve performance in some cases, especially when modular neural networks are beneficial. However, apart from objectives aiming to make networks more modular, such structural objectives have not been widely explored. We propose two new structural objectives and test their ability to guide evolving neural networks on two problems which can benefit from decomposition into subtasks. The first structural objective guides evolution to align neural networks with a user-recommended decomposition pattern. Intuitively, this should be a powerful guiding target for problems where human users can easily identify a structure. The second structural objective guides evolution towards a population with a high diversity in decomposition patterns. This results in exploration of many different ways to decompose a problem, allowing evolution to find good decompositions faster. Tests on our target problems reveal that both methods perform well on a problem with a very clear and decomposable structure. However, on a problem where the optimal decomposition is less obvious, the structural diversity objective is found to outcompete other structural objectives—and this technique can even increase performance on problems without any decomposable structure at all.",

        "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing algorithms based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are evolving to be a disruptive technology driving machine learning research. The overarching goal of this work is to develop a structured algorithmic framework for SNN training that optimizes unique SNN-specific properties like neuron spiking threshold using neuroevolution as a feedback strategy. We provide extensive results for this hybrid bio-inspired training strategy and show that such a feedback-based learning approach leads to explainable neuromorphic systems that adapt to the specific underlying application. Our analysis reveals 53.8, 28.8, and 28.2% latency improvement for the neuroevolution-based SNN training strategy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively in contrast to state-of-the-art conversion based approaches. The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to other application domains like image classification in presence of adversarial attacks where 43.2 and 27.9% latency improvements were observed on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a widespread problem in the field of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms that automate the process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure prevention systems. Therefore, many machine learning models have been designed to address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with some generative adversarial elements. This work shows a framework that incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly detection scores of new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution strategies for evolving an ensemble model, in which every single model works on a subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimize the architecture and hyperparameters such as the window size, the number of layers, and the layer depths. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully automated mode. We ran tests on the SWAT and WADI datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection model is built in a fully automatic way using a neuroevolution strategy.",

Most traditional approaches to multiagent learning are affected by long training periods as well as high computational complexity. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a popular evolutionary strategy used to obtain the best performing neural network architecture often used to tackle optimization problems in the field of artificial intelligence. This paper utilizes the NEAT algorithm to achieve competitive multiagent learning on a modified pong game environment in an efficient manner. The competing agents abide by different rules while having similar observation space parameters. The proposed algorithm utilizes this property of the environment to define a singular neuroevolutionary procedure that obtains the optimal policy for all the agents. The compiled results indicate that the proposed implementation achieves ideal behaviour in a very short training period when compared to existing multiagent reinforcement learning models.",

        "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) is a class of attacks on the physical implementation of a cipher, which enables the extraction of confidential key information by exploiting unintended leaks generated by a device. In recent years, researchers have observed that neural networks (NNs) can be utilized to perform highly effective SCA profiling, even against countermeasure-hardened targets. This study investigates a new approach to designing NNs for SCA, called neuroevolution to attack side-channel traces yielding convolutional neural networks (NASCTY-CNNs). This method is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves the architectural hyperparameters to automatically create CNNs for side-channel analysis. The findings of this research demonstrate that we can achieve performance results comparable to state-of-the-art methods when dealing with desynchronized leakages protected by masking techniques. This indicates that employing similar neuroevolutionary techniques could serve as a promising avenue for further exploration. Moreover, the similarities observed among the constructed neural networks shed light on how NASCTY effectively constructs architectures and addresses the implemented countermeasures.",

This paper uses the NEAT calculation to accomplish serious multiagent learning on a changed pong game climate in a productive way. The contending specialists keep various guidelines while having comparable perception space boundaries. The proposed calculation uses this property of the climate to characterize a particular neuro transformative system that gets the ideal strategy for every one of the specialists. The ordered outcomes show that the proposed execution accomplishes ideal conduct in an exceptionally short preparation period when contrasted with existing multiagent support learning models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWhile interest in artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been renewed by the ubiquitous use of deep learning to solve high-dimensional problems, we are still far from general artificial intelligence. In this article, we address the problem of emergent cognitive capabilities and, more crucially, of their detection, by relying on co-evolving creatures with mutable morphology and neural structure. The former is implemented via both static and mobile structures whose shapes are controlled by cubic splines. The latter uses ESHyperNEAT to discover not only appropriate combinations of connections and weights but also to extrapolate hidden neuron distribution. The creatures integrate low-level perceptions (touch/pain proprioceptors, retina-based vision, frequency-based hearing) to inform their actions. By discovering a functional mapping between individual neurons and specific stimuli, we extract a high-level module-based abstraction of a creature’s brain. This drastically simplifies the discovery of relationships between naturally occurring events and their neural implementation. Applying this methodology to creatures resulting from solitary and tag-team co-evolution showed remarkable dynamics such as range-finding and structured communication. Such discovery was made possible by the abstraction provided by the modular ANN which allowed groups of neurons to be viewed as functionally enclosed entities.",

However, there is a lack of accessible tools to analyse, contrast and visualise the behaviour of neuroevolution systems. A variety of search strategies have been proposed such as Novelty search and Quality-Diversity search, but their impact on the evolutionary dynamics is not well understood. We propose using a data-driven, graph-based model, search trajectory networks (STNs) to analyse, visualise and directly contrast the behaviour of different neuroevolution search methods. Our analysis uses NEAT for solving maze problems with two search strategies: novelty-based and fitness-based, and including and excluding the crossover operator. We model and visualise the trajectories, contrasting and illuminating the behaviour of the studied neuroevolution variants. Our results confirm the advantages of novelty search in this setting, but challenge the usefulness of recombination.",
