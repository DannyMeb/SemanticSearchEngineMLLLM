        "abstract": "With the growth of free improvisation as a field of study within academic institutions there is a need to investigate the fundamental musical and psychological processes that lie behind this creative form of social activity. This chapter presents interviews with eight expert free-improvising musicians. The interviews focused on how the participants developed their creative skills, and offer insights into their learning processes. Thematic analysis of the transcribed interviews highlights three main learning modes: autodidactism, mentoring and learning in a social context. These areas of learning influenced conceptual and practical approaches to performance, and participants emphasised the importance of mentoring and group learning as critical elements in their becoming improvising musicians. The experiences of the interviewees reveal the socially constructed nature of musical development and creativity, and the nature of the social environments in which learning can take place.",

It investigates how the troop-to-space ratio and the imbalance between strategic and tactical mobility — combined with firepower contributed to the stalemate on the Western Front. Beyond these daunting firepower and organizational challenges, the chapter also looks at a number of coordination problems being faced by the commanders during the war: infantry–artillery coordination, the challenge around achieving surprise, and logistics. It also examines the two unenviable trade-offs encountered by the commanders which revolved around depth and breadth. The chapter then shifts to discuss the challenges of the defenders and how they had to constantly adapt during the war. It identifies the optimal doctrine for ending the stalemate. Finally, the chapter analyzes the British, French, and German armies' set of solutions to these problems and challenges: assault tactics, combined-arms, and elastic defense in depth.",

        "abstract": "This chapter highlights the important lessons about wartime learning. It seeks to know what enabled the marines — masters of conventional maneuver warfare — to adapt to the demands of a decidedly unconventional counterinsurgency doctrine. It also explores why do some militaries learn faster than others and what can we do to ensure that the Marine Corps — and all of our war-fighting organizations — are ready to learn as quickly as possible the next time we send troops into harm's way. The chapter's central premise is that the First World War is uniquely relevant to the challenges that today's leaders face as they prepare for tomorrow's wars. It then shifts to outline at least three reasons why the First World War — and the years leading up to it — is relevant to the challenges military leaders face today. The first reason involves the rate of technological change, the second reason concerns the character of technological change, and the third reason involves the relative absence of great-power wars in recent times. The chapter offers a theory of wartime learning — assessment, command, and training (ACT) theory — to explore how the German Army mastered the elastic defense in depth.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on using MOOCs to learn image denoising techniques. It begins with an introduction to the concept of MOOCs - these innovative online learning platforms that offer a wide range of courses across disciplines, providing convenient and affordable learning opportunities for a global audience. It then explains the characteristics of MOOC's wide coverage, high flexibility, and different from traditional education models. It then introduces the advantages of MOOCs: accessibility and inclusiveness (open to anyone with an Internet connection), cost-effectiveness (a cost-effective alternative, many courses available for free), flexibility and self-paced learning (the ability to learn at your own pace), a diverse curriculum and global expertise. Then the concept of image denoising is introduced - image denoising is a basic process of digital image processing, and the common denoising methods are described: filter method and the applicable range of various filters, the advantages and disadvantages of wavelet change, the advantages of deep learning method and the principle of non-local mean denoising technology. It then describes how MOOCs can help learn image denoising: integrating course content, getting expert guidance, hands-on exercises and projects, and community and peer communication. In addition, it introduces the challenges encountered by MOOCs: high dropout rate, quality and credibility of MOOCs, lack of interaction and humanization in traditional classrooms, accessibility. The relationship between E-learning and MOOC is also introduced – E-learning and MOOC play complementary roles in modern education. MOOC provide a structured, flexible, cost-effective environment and a transformative educational experience for learning about biological image denoising.",

        "abstract": "Chains would be interesting if only because their share of GDP is three times that of manufacturing. However, what makes them valuable for management scholars is that they are “learning lab rats”: Each chain has a large number of essentially identical operating units. In addition, chains have two levels of learning: within units and across units. Comparisons within and across units allow us to better isolate factors driving heterogeneity in learning rates. Review of such studies suggests three factors drive differences in learning rates: properties of new practices (design maturity, extent of codification), properties of the operating units (knowledge of practices/implementation, incentives to adopt them), and fit between the practices and the operating unit (extent to which they enhance performance). These insights suggest a number of means to increase learning (even outside chains): better design of practices, more complete codification/training of those practices, and novel organizational designs.",

        "abstract": "Quest Alliance began its organizational journey as digital technology was about to unfold sweeping changes in India, including in the areas of education and employment. As if to symbolize its tryst with technology, it is nestled in India’s “silicon valley” city of Bengaluru. Today, it also happens to enjoy the patronage of an enviable list of marquee donors ranging from leaders in the financial services industry and information technology to multilateral development agencies and Indian Government. Over the course of its work with these partners, Quest Alliance has come to serve as an interesting node in the arena of skill development and operates at the intersection of education, technology and youth employment. Established in 2005, it started as an earnest but modest enterprise. From 2009—when it had seven people and a sudden crisis of funding at hand—till 2022, it saw rapid acceleration. By the end of 2022, it had a team of 234 handling over INR 62 crore worth of annual funding. What Quest was working on—“Enabling self-learning”—was highly topical and certainly aided its growth, but amidst this growth something unusually remained steadfast: the extent of its investment on learning, development and capacity building of its own team. This holds significance for civil society where sourcing and building talent is a continuous pre-occupation for leadership. The case engages with the journey of Quest and its founder Aakash Sethi, and explores what it takes to put in place the internal scaffolding to hold together this deliberate and sustained focus on self-learning and development of its own people. It also engages with Quest’s work towards evolving a model of talent-building of young people in schools as well as those in transition from education to employment: anchored in the notion of young people as self-learners equipped with 21st century skills. The latter part of the case explores how Quest has crafted its own people management practice around the “self-learner” and gives learners the opportunity to reflect on the challenges of building and maintaining a way of being, doing and relating in a rapidly growing organization.",

        "abstract": "Although Puerto Rican students’ school dropout rate was high in the 1970s, the number of students attending colleges and universities increased, both in Chicago and across the state. Two of those institutions, Northeastern Illinois University and the University of Illinois Circle Campus (later known as the University of Illinois at Chicago), quickly became sites of contention as the students sought institutional changes aimed at increasing the number of Puerto Rican and other Latina/o students and creating resources and opportunities to enhance their success. Perhaps learning from their community’s struggles during the previous decade, Puerto Rican students mobilized and utilized their community capital to challenge yet another system of education that they saw as impeding their progress. Chapter 4 serves to historicize the experiences of these students.",
