        "abstract": "Deep Learning is a new generation of artificial neural networks that have transformed our daily lives and has impacted several industries and scientific disciplines in recent years. Recent development in deep learning provides various significant methods to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. Generative Adversarial Networks give the idea of learning the deep representations without extensively interpreting the training data. The generative adversarial network involves the generative modeling approach that uses the deep learning approach. The chapter is broadly divided into the following sections as (1) Insights of deep learning &amp; the generative adversarial networks, (2) GAN’s representative variants, training methods, architecture, and mathematical representation, and (3) Efficacy of GAN in different applications. This chapter will gain the recent work done in GAN and implement this technique in the different deep learning applications for healthcare. Here, we will also analyze some of the future perspectives and trends in the forthcoming time.<br>",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia is a common disease that occurs in many countries, more specifically, in poor countries. This disease is an obstructive pneumonia which has the same impression on pulmonary radiographs as other pulmonary diseases, which makes it hard to distinguish even for medical radiologists. Lately, image processing and deep learning models are established to rapidly and precisely diagnose pneumonia disease. In this research, we have predicted pneumonia diseases dependably from the X-ray images, employing image segmentation and machine learning models. A public labelled database is utilized with 4000 pneumonia disease X-rays and 4000 healthy X-rays. ImgNet and SqueezeNet are utilized for transfer learning from their previous computed weights. The proposed deep learning models are trained for classifying pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases. The following processes are presented in this paper: X-ray segmentation utilizing BoxENet architecture, X-ray classification utilizing the segmented chest images. We propose the improved BoxENet model by incorporating transfer learning from both ImgNet and SqueezeNet using a majority fusion model. Performance metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and Dice are evaluated. The proposed Improved BoxENet model outperforms the other models in binary and multi-classification models. Additionally, the Improved BoxENet has higher speed compared to other models in both training and classification.",

        "abstract": "IoT-based communication between medical devices has encouraged the healthcare industry to use automated systems which provide effective insight from the massive amount of gathered data. AI and machine learning have played a major role in the design of such systems. Accuracy and validation are considered, since copious training data is required in a neural network (NN)-based deep learning model. This is hardly feasible in medical research, because the size of data sets is constrained by complexity and high cost experiments. The availability of limited sample data validation of NN remains a concern. The prediction of outcomes on a NN trained on a smaller data set cannot guarantee performance and exhibits unstable behaviors. Surrogate data-based validation of NN can be viewed as a solution. In the current chapter, the classification of breast tissue data by a NN model has been detailed. In the absence of a huge data set, a surrogate data-based validation approach has been applied. The discussed study can be applied for predictive modelling for applications described by small data sets. ",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the acquisition of different deep learning (DL) algorithms is becoming an advantage in the healthcare sector. Algorithms like CNN (Convolution Neural Network) are used to detect diseases and classify the images of various disease abnormalities. It has been proven that CNN shows high performance in the classification of diseases, so deep learning can remove doubts that occur in the healthcare sector. DL is also used in the reconstruction of various medical diagnoses images like Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. CNN is used to map input image data to reference image data, and this process is known as the registration of images using deep learning. DL is used to extract secrets in the healthcare sector. CNN has many hidden layers in the network so that prediction and analysis can be made accurately. Deep learning has many applications in the healthcare system, like the detection of cancer, gene selection, tumor detection, recognition of human activities, the outbreak of infectious diseases, etc. DL has become famous in the field of healthcare due to its open data source. In the case of the small dataset, CNN becomes an advantage as it does not provide an excellent way to statistical importance. Deep Learning is a technique that includes the basis of ANN (Artificial neural networks), appears as a robust tool for machine learning, and encourages recasting artificial intelligence. Deep learning architecture has more than two hidden layers, as in ANN; it is only one or two. Therefore, this chapter represents a survey of the role of deep learning in the healthcare industry with its challenges and future scope.<br>",

Deep Learning is a group of neural network algorithms and learns from various levels of representation and abstraction to aid in the data interpretation. Since the datasets get bigger, computers become more powerful, and the training of the datasets (images or numeric) gets much easier and the results achieved using deep learning are better. In contrast to machine-learning algorithms that rely on large amounts of labelled data, human cognition can find structure in unlabeled data, a technique known as unsupervised learning. It was noted that using deep learning algorithms on the dataset will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in future. In this chapter, the authors study deep learning algorithms to diagnose diabetic retinopathy retinal images and training a convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm to identify object tumors from a large set of brain tumor images.

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) is a major focus of discussion in the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector in the United States generates around one trillion Gigabytes of clinical data annually. With limited resources, manually analyzing these massive amounts of data is a tremendously time-consuming. Finding useful patterns and acquiring knowledge from high-dimensional, poorly annotated, heterogeneous and complex clinical data continues to be a significant challenge in the health care sector. Latest advancements in DL have been shown as an efficacious approach to building end-to-end learning models for disease prognosis and diagnosis. In the past, discovering information from data has been accomplished through the use of conventional Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These techniques first require optimal features to be extracted from clinical data before building a disease predictive model on top of them. Problems with these techniques are that they do not scale properly with the increase in data due to a lack of domain knowledge. Firstly, this chapter explores popular DL algorithms for various types of clinical data. These algorithms can potentially prevent infectious disease, reducing operating costs, and efforts. Finally, the challenges while designing and implementing a holistic DL model have been discussed for disease prediction.",

        "abstract": "Disease classification based on machine learning has become a crucial research topic in the fields of genetics and molecular biology. Generally, disease classification involves a supervised learning style; i.e., it requires a large number of labelled samples to achieve good classification performance. However, in the majority of the cases, labelled samples are hard to obtain, so the amount of training data are limited. However, many unclassified (unlabelled) sequences have been deposited in public databases, which may help the training procedure. This method is called semi-supervised learning and is very useful in many applications. Self-training can be implemented using high- to low-confidence samples to prevent noisy samples from affecting the robustness of semi-supervised learning in the training process. The deep forest method with the hyperparameter settings used in this paper can achieve excellent performance. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel combined deep learning model and semi-supervised learning with self-training approach to improve the performance in disease classification, which utilizes unlabelled samples to update a mechanism designed to increase the number of high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve good performance in disease classification and disease-causing gene identification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nGlioma is the most common primary brain tumor, and it's extremely dangerous for the patient's health. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based glioma segmentation is an important tool for doctors to use when examining, analyzing, and diagnosing glioma's outward appearance both for the indoor and outdoor patients. Among other methods, deep learning-based glioma segmentation is the most widely used in literature. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed glioma segmentation methods which is primarily based on deep learning more specifically convolution neural networks. A DM-DA-based cascade method for glioma segmentation based on 2DResUnet is proposed to address the problem of insufficient 3D spatial information acquisition in 2D full convolutional networks and the memory consumption problem of 3D full convolutional networks. Use of multiple-scale fusion mechanisms, DenseBlock, Attention, and multi-scale convolutional networks to segment gliomas at different stages and fixed region sampling to reduce the model's three-dimensionality in the Unet model using the glioma image's multi-sequence information, the convolutional network can better segment the tumor by using less memory. Use the BraTS18 data set for local five-fold cross-validation, and use the BraTS17 data set for official online evaluation. The evaluation results show that the average Dice Score of the edema, core and enhancement areas of the glioma segmentation results on the BraTS17 validation set by DM-DA-Unet achieves higher performance. The average sensitivity is also high, which is close to the best model segmentation effect on the BraTS17 validation set, and can accurately segment gliomas.",
