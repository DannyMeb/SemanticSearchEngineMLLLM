        "abstract": "AbstractRecent large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable prediction performance for a growing array of tasks. However, their proliferation into high-stakes domains and compute-limited settings has created a burgeoning need for interpretability and efficiency. We address this need by proposing Aug-imodels, a framework for leveraging the knowledge learned by LLMs to build extremely efficient and interpretable prediction models. Aug-imodels use LLMs during fitting but not during inference, allowing complete transparency and often a speed/memory improvement of greater than 1000x for inference compared to LLMs. We explore two instantiations of Aug-imodels in natural-language processing: Aug-Linear, which augments a linear model with decoupled embeddings from an LLM and Aug-Tree, which augments a decision tree with LLM feature expansions. Across a variety of text-classification datasets, both outperform their non-augmented, interpretable counterparts. Aug-Linear can even outperform much larger models, e.g. a 6-billion parameter GPT-J model, despite having 10,000x fewer parameters and being fully transparent. We further explore Aug-imodels in a natural-language fMRI study, where they generate interesting interpretations from scientific data.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), attracting considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. These models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various tasks, including decision-making. This paper aims to compare the decision-making efficiency of two prominent LLMs, Bard and GPT, across different domains.To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, a set of carefully designed questions was used to assess the performance of Bard and GPT in specific decision-making contexts. Through quantitative analysis, we aimed to quantify their abilities and identify potential variations in their performance.The results of our study revealed interesting insights into the decision-making efficiency of Bard and GPT across different domains. In the domain of logical reasoning and error detection, both Bard and GPT exhibited similar performance, but GPT outperformed Bard in data analysis by a notable margin. This finding suggests that GPT possesses stronger analytical abilities, enabling it to make more accurate and reliable decisions in contexts that require accurate data analysis and interpretation.The comparative analysis of Bard and GPT's decision-making efficiency highlights the significance of considering the specific domains and tasks when evaluating the performance of LLMs. It underscores the fact that different LLMs may possess domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, which can have a profound impact on their decision-making capabilities.Future research endeavors may involve expanding the evaluation to additional domains and considering a larger sample of questions to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the findings. Moreover, investigating the interpretability and explainability of LLMs in decision-making processes could shed further light on their decision-making strategies and enhance trust and transparency in their applications.This paper contributes to the growing body of research on LLMs by comparing the decision-making efficiency of Bard and GPT across different domains. The findings highlight the relative strengths of each model, emphasizing the importance of domain-specific considerations in decision-making tasks. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, practitioners can harness their potential to improve decision-making processes in diverse real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Detection of false or misleading green claims (referred to as “greenwashing”) within company sustainability disclosures is challenging for a number of reasons, which include the textual and qualitative nature, volume, and complexity of such disclosures. In recent years, notable progress made in the fields of artificial intelligence and specifically, large language models (LLMs), has showcased the capacity of these tools to effectively analyse extensive and intricate textual data, including the contents of sustainability disclosures. Transformer-based LLMs, such as Google’s BERT architecture, were trained on general domain text corpora. Subsequent research has shown that further pre-training of such LLMs on specific domains, such as the climate or sustainability domains, may improve performance. However, previous research often uses text corpora that exhibit significant variation across topics and language and which often consist of heterogeneous subdomains. We therefore propose a conceptual framework for further pre-training of transformer based LLMs using text corpora relating to specific sustainability subdomains i.e. subdomain specific pre-training. We do so as a basis for the improved performance of such models in analysing sustainability disclosures. The main contribution is a conceptual framework to advance the use of LLMs for the reliable identification of green claims and ultimately, greenwashing.\r\nKeywords: greenwashing, artificial intelligence, sustainability, sustainability reporting, sustainability disclosures.",

Additionally, the review seeks to identify key areas for future research, with a particular focus on AI ethics considerations for responsible use and ensuring trustworthy AI.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nFollowing the scoping review methodological framework, a search strategy was conducted across 6 databases. To structure our review, we employed AI ethics guidelines and principles, constructing a concept matrix for investigating the responsible use of AI in telehealth. Using the concept matrix in our review enabled the identification of gaps in the literature and informed future research directions.\n\n\nResults\nTwenty studies were included in the review. Among the included studies, 5 were empirical, and 15 were reviews and perspectives focusing on different telehealth applications and healthcare contexts. Benefit and reliability concepts were frequently discussed in these studies. Privacy, security, and accountability were peripheral themes, with transparency, explainability, human agency, and contestability lacking conceptual or empirical exploration.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe findings emphasized the potential of LLMs, especially ChatGPT, in telehealth. They provide insights into understanding the use of LLMs, enhancing telehealth services, and taking ethical considerations into account. By proposing three future research directions with a focus on responsible use, this review further contributes to the advancement of this emerging phenomenon of healthcare AI.\n",

        "abstract": "This comprehensive survey delves into the integration and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the tourism sector, a domain ripe with potential for transformative AI-driven enhancements. As tourism increasingly embraces digital innovation, LLMs stand at the forefront of this evolution, offering sophisticated solutions for personalized travel experiences, multilingual communication, and the preservation of cultural heritage. This paper systematically explores the multifaceted roles of LLMs in tourism, from generating dynamic travel itineraries and culturally rich site descriptions to providing real-time assistance and multilingual support for global travelers. Through an analysis of current implementations and potential applications, we highlight both the remarkable opportunities presented by LLMs and the significant challenges, including data privacy concerns, cultural sensitivity, and the need for real-time processing capabilities. The findings underscore the imperative for a balanced approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs while addressing ethical considerations and ensuring inclusivity and accessibility in global tourism. This survey aims to provide a foundational understanding for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, guiding future innovations and fostering a responsible integration of AI technologies in enhancing the global tourism experience.\n",

        "abstract": "This paper draws on information infrastructures (IIs) in science and technology studies (STS), as well as on feminist STS scholarship and contemporary critical accounts of digital technologies, to build an initial mapping of the infrastructural mechanisms and implications of large language models (LLMs). Through a comparison with discriminatory machine learning (ML) systems and a case study on gender bias, I present LLMs as contested artefacts with categorising and performative capabilities. This paper suggests that generative systems do not tangibly depart from traditional, discriminative counterparts in terms of their underlying probabilistic mechanisms, and therefore both technologies can be theorised as infrastructures of categorisation. However, LLMs additionally retain performative capabilities through their linguistic outputs. Here, I outline the intuition behind this phenomenon, which I refer to as “language as infrastructure”. While traditional, discriminative systems “disappear” into larger IIs, the hype surrounding generative technologies presents an opportunity to scrutinise these artefacts, to alter their computational mechanisms and introduce governance measures]. I illustrate this thesis through Sharma’s formulation of “broken machine”, and suggest dataset curation and participatory design as governance mechanisms that can partly address downstream harms in LLMs (Barocas, et al., 2023).",

LLMs can generate educational material, summarize text, extract structured data from free text, create reports, write programs, and potentially assist in case sign-out. LLMs combined with vision models can assist in interpreting histopathology images. LLMs have immense potential in transforming pathology practice and education, but these models are not infallible, so any artificial intelligence generated content must be verified with reputable sources. Caution must be exercised on how these models are integrated into clinical practice, as these models can produce hallucinations and incorrect results, and an over-reliance on artificial intelligence may lead to de-skilling and automation bias. This review paper provides a brief history of LLMs and highlights several use cases for LLMs in the field of pathology.",

        "abstract": "In deep learning, large language models are typically trained on data from a corpus as representative of current knowledge. However, natural language is not an ideal form for the reliable communication of concepts. Instead, formal logical statements are preferable since they are subject to verifiability, reliability, and applicability. Another reason for this preference is that natural language is not designed for an efficient and reliable flow of information and knowledge, but is instead designed as an evolutionary adaptation as formed from a prior set of natural constraints. As a formally structured language, logical statements are also more interpretable. They may be informally constructed in the form of a natural language statement, but a formalized logical statement is expected to follow a stricter set of rules, such as with the use of symbols for representing the logic-based operators that connect multiple simple statements and form verifiable propositions.",

        "abstract": "It is argued that the Curry-Howard correspondence for classical logic implies limitations for logical reasoning that can be learned and performed by large language models. The correspondence establishes an isomorphism between proofs in logic and programs in functional typed lambda calculus. While intuitionistic logic maps to a version of lambda calculus that can be carried out in a local way, i.e., considering local parts of the code in isolation, the version of lambda calculus that corresponds to classical logic requires non-local relations – and this non-locality cannot be learned by large language models due to their restriction to investigate a relative short sequence of tokens. A possible way to go beyond this limitation is sketched as well. Implications for other areas are investigated as well.\n",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on the basis of task-based benchmarks such as MMLU. Such benchmarks do not examine the behaviour of LLMs in specific contexts. This is particularly true in the LGBTI+ context where social stereotypes may result in variation in LGBTI+ terminology. Therefore, domain-specific lexicons or dictionaries may be useful as a representative list of words against which the LLM’s behaviour needs to be evaluated. This paper presents a methodology for evaluation of LLMs using an LGBTI+ lexicon in Indian languages. The methodology consists of four steps: formulating NLP tasks relevant to the expected behaviour, creating prompts that test LLMs, using the LLMs to obtain the output and, finally, manually evaluating the results. Our qualitative analysis shows that the three LLMs we experiment on are unable to detect underlying hateful content. Similarly, we observe limitations in using machine translation as means to evaluate natural language understanding in languages other than English. The methodology presented in this paper can be useful for LGBTI+ lexicons in other languages as well as other domain-specific lexicons. The work done in this paper opens avenues for responsible behaviour of LLMs in the Indian context, especially with prevalent social perception of the LGBTI+ community.",

        "abstract": "Large language models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have recently gained attention for their impressive natural language processing capabilities. While their potential to revolutionize various industries is still being explored, the tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from their use. In this study, we conduct an early assessment of the impact potential of GPTs on the tourism industry using a mixed-methods approach.\n\nWe first analyze the existing literature on the use of GPTs in the tourism industry and identify several potential applications such as personalized travel recommendations, language translation, and chatbots. We then collect data from various stakeholders in the tourism industry through surveys and interviews to understand their current practices and their willingness to adopt GPT-based solutions.\n\nOur results indicate that while there is a high level of awareness and interest in GPTs among tourism professionals, the adoption of these technologies is currently limited. The main barriers identified include a lack of technical expertise, concerns around data privacy and security, and the high cost of implementing GPT-based solutions. However, those who have adopted GPTs report significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and improved customer satisfaction.\n\nTo further explore the potential of GPTs in the tourism industry, we conduct a pilot study to develop a GPT-based travel recommendation system. The system uses GPT to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and feedback. Our evaluation of the system indicates that it performs well in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction, demonstrating the potential for GPTs to provide personalized and tailored experiences to travellers.\n\nOverall, our study provides an early look at the impact potential of GPTs on the tourism industry and identifies several avenues for future research. We recommend that tourism professionals and researchers collaborate to address the current barriers to adoption and explore the full range of applications for GPTs in the industry.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA recent paper by Häffner et al. (2023, Political Analysis 31, 481–499) introduces an interpretable deep learning approach for domain-specific dictionary creation, where it is claimed that the dictionary-based approach outperforms finetuned language models in predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability. We show that the dictionary-based approach’s reported superiority over large language models, BERT specifically, is due to the fact that most of the parameters in the language models are excluded from finetuning. In this letter, we first discuss the architecture of BERT models, then explain the limitations of finetuning only the top classification layer, and lastly we report results where finetuned language models outperform the newly proposed dictionary-based approach by 27% in terms of \n\n\n\n$R^2$\n\n\n and 46% in terms of mean squared error once we allow these parameters to learn during finetuning. Researchers interested in large language models, text classification, and text regression should find our results useful. Our code and data are publicly available.",

These datasets contain judgments of lexical properties like concreteness and age of acquisition, and can be used to norm experimental stimuli, discover empirical relationships in the lexicon, and stress-test computational models. However, collecting human judgments at scale is both time-consuming and expensive. This issue of scale is compounded for multi-dimensional norms and those incorporating context. The current work asks whether large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to augment the creation of large, psycholinguistic datasets in English. I use GPT-4 to collect multiple kinds of semantic judgments (e.g., word similarity, contextualized sensorimotor associations, iconicity) for English words and compare these judgments against the human “gold standard”. For each dataset, I find that GPT-4’s judgments are positively correlated with human judgments, in some cases rivaling or even exceeding the average inter-annotator agreement displayed by humans. I then identify several ways in which LLM-generated norms differ from human-generated norms systematically. I also perform several “substitution analyses”, which demonstrate that replacing human-generated norms with LLM-generated norms in a statistical model does not change the sign of parameter estimates (though in select cases, there are significant changes to their magnitude). I conclude by discussing the considerations and limitations associated with LLM-generated norms in general, including concerns of data contamination, the choice of LLM, external validity, construct validity, and data quality. Additionally, all of GPT-4’s judgments (over 30,000 in total) are made available online for further analysis.",

        "abstract": " Political theory as a discipline has long been skeptical of computational methods. In this paper, I argue that it is time for theory to make a perspectival shift on these methods. Specifically, we should consider integrating recently developed generative large language models like GPT-4 as tools to support our creative work as theorists. Ultimately, I suggest that political theorists should embrace this technology as a method of supporting our capacity for creativity—but that we should do so in a way that is mindful of the content and value of theorizing, the technical constraints of the models, and the ethical questions that the technology raises.

To optimize for efficiency, we employ a distillation technique that effectively reduces the size of the original input paper by 50%, while maintaining the paragraph structure and overall semantic integrity. We then explore the model’s responses using a multi-document context (ten distilled documents). Our findings indicate that GPT-4 excels in the multi-document domain, providing detailed answers contextualized within the framework of related research findings. Our results showcase the potential of large language models for the astronomical community, offering a promising avenue for further exploration, particularly the possibility of utilizing the models for hypothesis generation.",

        "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has offered a reliable foundation for measurement of young children’s reading skills and of second-language (L2) speaking skills. This is because well-fit task-specific language models (LMs) enable recognition that supports accurate scoring of pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary, usage, and grammar (Bernstein and Cheng, 2023). ASR works well in these measurement tasks because measurement of word production, disfluencies, and pronunciation errors is not very sensitive to moderate differences in word-error-rate (WER) accuracy, and because speech-interactive tasks appropriate for reading instruction or L2 assessment elicit relatively predictable responses, for which task-specific low-perplexity ASR systems achieve sufficiently accurate speech recognition (Cheng and Townshend, 2003). In the work reported here, we compared the accuracy of two English ASR systems on a set of 718 extended spontaneous speech recordings from 77 adult non-native speakers of English speaking from six countries under uncontrolled recording conditions. A Kaldi-based ASR system with well-fit task-specific LMs achieved WER 17%, while USM, a general-purpose mSLAM recognizer with an RNN-T decoder, achieved 11% WER, which is a 34% relative improvement. The mSLAM + RNN-T technology will be briefly described and an analysis of results in three different open-response interactive speaking tasks will be presented.",

        "abstract": "The research creates a professional certification survey to test large language models and evaluate their employable skills. It compares the performance of two AI models, GPT-3 and Turbo-GPT3.5, on a benchmark dataset of 1149 professional certifications, emphasizing vocational readiness rather than academic performance. GPT-3 achieved a passing score (>70% correct) in 39% of the professional certifications without fine-tuning or exam preparation. The models demonstrated qualifications in various computer-related fields, such as cloud and virtualization, business analytics, cybersecurity, network setup and repair, and data analytics. Turbo-GPT3.5 scored 100% on the valuable Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam. The models also displayed competence in other professional domains, including nursing, licensed counseling, pharmacy, and teaching. Turbo-GPT3.5 passed the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 exam with a 70% grade without preparation. Interestingly, Turbo-GPT3.5 performed well on customer service tasks, suggesting potential applications in human augmentation for chatbots in call centers and routine advice services. The models also score well on sensory and experience-based tests such as wine sommelier, beer taster, emotional quotient, and body language reader. The OpenAI model improvement from Babbage to Turbo resulted in a median 60% better-graded performance in less than a few years. This progress suggests that focusing on the latest model's shortcomings could lead to a highly performant AI capable of mastering the most demanding professional certifications. We open-source the benchmark to expand the range of testable professional skills as the models improve or gain emergent capabilities.",

        "abstract": "As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This paper delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI.",

        "abstract": "\n The focus of this text is on the influence of large linguistic models on the self-determination of the humanities. Large language models are able to generate plausible texts. It seems that they thus become on a par with other tools that, throughout the development of technology have freed people from routine. At the same time, for the humanities, the individualization of the generated texts is very great, and knowledge itself is closely related to its textual embodiment. If we agree that knowledge is a text, and embodied in another text, another knowledge appears before us, then humanities will have to answer the question of how a text generated by a person differs in value from the same text generated by a machine. The text of the work raises methodological and epistemological problems of the correlation of texts of natural and artificial origin if they are made in the genre of a scientific work. The difference between such artifacts is clearly visible only for some scientific disciplines, and raises questions about the rest. These issues should be resolved with the help of deep reflection, which was not so urgently needed in the last centuries of the development of the humanities, but which is now required from a humanitarian scientist. The humanitarian will have to explicitly oppose himself to large language models and prove the importance of his work compared to what a neural network can generate.\n\t",

While LLMs have transformed various fields, their evaluation in Arabic remains limited. This work addresses this gap by proposing a novel evaluation method for LLMs in both Arabic and English, allowing for a direct comparison between the performance of the two languages. We build a new evaluation dataset based on the General Aptitude Test (GAT), a standardized test widely used for university admissions in the Arab world, that we utilize to measure the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. We conduct several experiments to examine the linguistic capabilities of ChatGPT and quantify how much better it is at English than Arabic. We also examine the effect of changing task descriptions from Arabic to English and vice-versa. In addition to that, we find that fastText can surpass ChatGPT in finding Arabic word analogies. We conclude by showing that GPT-4 Arabic linguistic capabilities are much better than ChatGPT’s Arabic capabilities and are close to ChatGPT’s English capabilities.",

Large language models such as GPT-4 and LLAMA, with their remarkable text-generation capabilities, stand at the forefront of this AI revolution. In the first part of the presentation, I examine how these AI tools are reshaping the nature of systematic reviews. The ability to analyze, summarize, and generate vast amounts of text allows these models to facilitate more efficient processes, offering a valuable tool to researchers navigating through vast databases of published work.\nI would discuss how AI is engendering new developments in research methodology. Through the use of predictive modelling and advanced analytics, AI tools like GPT-4 allow for a deeper understanding of existing research and the identification of gaps in the literature, thereby promoting innovative research approaches. However, these advancements come with the need for updated ethical frameworks, a topic I would try to address also.\nThe issues related to AI use include issues of transparency and accountability, as the ”blackbox” approach to deep learning models can be uncovered; without appropriate interpretability architecture (such as with GPT-4 or LLAMA), these models can be generating inaccurate information based on their predictive capabilities.\nNevertheless, these have proved to be of use, and with a fine prompt tuning, publicly available models can be of great use to researchers. I would delve into the question of how to balance the benefits of AI tools with the need to maintain high ethical standards in research, aiming to provide possible insights into how these ethical frameworks might be updated to accommodate the new realities of AI.\nFurthermore, I’d reflect on the consequences of AI for the evaluation of research. While AI can aid in the quick assessment of a paper's relevance or novelty, questions remain about its capacity to fully evaluate the quality and significance of research. This discussion emphasizes the need for a blend of AI models with human expertise to achieve robust research evaluation for the time being (or for further training for specific use cases of the models.)\nI’d like to conclude with a reflection on the overall impact of the integration of AI LLMs on systematic reviews and research dissemination. While acknowledging the transformative potential of AI in reshaping the scientific landscape, it underscores the need for careful navigation of the associated challenges and ethical implications.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of large language models (LLMs) as powerful tools for various applications, including healthcare. These large-scale machine learning models, such as GPT and LLaMA have demonstrated potential for improving patient outcomes and transforming medical practice. However, healthcare professionals without a background in data science may find it challenging to understand and utilize these models effectively. This paper aims to provide an accessible introduction to LLMs for healthcare professionals, discussing their core concepts, relevant applications in healthcare, ethical considerations, challenges, and future directions. With an overview of LLMs, we foster a more collaborative future between healthcare professionals and data scientists, ultimately driving better patient care and medical advancements.",

However, they still have several limitations, for instance, the length of the context, degeneration processes, lack of logical structure, and facts consistency. In this work, we focus on the fact-checking problem applied to the output of the generative models on classical downstream tasks, such as paraphrasing, summarization, text style transfer, etc. We define the task of internal fact-checking, set the criteria for factual consistency, and present the novel dataset for this task for the Russian language. The benchmark for internal fact-checking and several baselines are also provided. We research data augmentation approaches to extend the training set and compare classification methods on different augmented data sets.",

        "abstract": "ChatGPT generated much dialogue on the implications of large language models (LLMs) for language teaching and learning. Since language teachers are uniquely positioned to teach metalinguistic awareness, they can support their learners’ understanding of how LLMs are shaped by language ideologies and how their outputs are indexical of social power. This awareness would help learners be more conscientious in using LLMs, deciding how to interact with them and adapt their outputs for their purposes. This article introduces LLMs as statistical systems that predict linguistic forms. It surfaces two language ideologies that have shaped their development: the belief in the separability of language from its social contexts and the belief in the value of larger text corpora. It also highlights some ideological effects including uneven language performance, text outputs that reflect biases, privacy violations, circulation of copyrighted materials, misinformation, and hallucinations. Some suggestions for mitigating these effects are offered.",
