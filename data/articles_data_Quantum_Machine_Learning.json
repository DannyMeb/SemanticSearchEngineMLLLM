        "abstract": "Quantum machine learning algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits are promising candidates for near-term quantum advantage. Although these algorithms are compatible with the current generation of quantum processors, device noise limits their performance, for example by inducing an exponential flattening of loss landscapes. Error suppression schemes such as dynamical decoupling and Pauli twirling alleviate this issue by reducing noise at the hardware level. A recent addition to this toolbox of techniques is pulse-efficient transpilation, which reduces circuit schedule duration by exploiting hardware-native cross-resonance interaction. In this work, we investigate the impact of pulse-efficient circuits on near-term algorithms for quantum machine learning. We report results for two standard experiments: binary classification on a synthetic dataset with quantum neural networks and handwritten digit recognition with quantum kernel estimation. In both cases, we find that pulse-efficient transpilation vastly reduces average circuit durations and, as a result, significantly improves classification accuracy. We conclude by applying pulse-efficient transpilation to the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz and show that it delays the onset of noise-induced barren plateaus.",

        "abstract": "The widespread success of deep neural networks has revealed a surprise in classical machine learning: very complex models often generalize well while simultaneously overfitting training data. This phenomenon of benign overfitting has been studied for a variety of classical models with the goal of better understanding the mechanisms behind deep learning. Characterizing the phenomenon in the context of quantum machine learning might similarly improve our understanding of the relationship between overfitting, overparameterization, and generalization. In this work, we provide a characterization of benign overfitting in quantum models. To do this, we derive the behavior of a classical interpolating Fourier features models for regression on noisy signals, and show how a class of quantum models exhibits analogous features, thereby linking the structure of quantum circuits (such as data-encoding and state preparation operations) to overparameterization and overfitting in quantum models. We intuitively explain these features according to the ability of the quantum model to interpolate noisy data with locally \"spiky\" behavior and provide a concrete demonstration example of benign overfitting.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA new paradigm for data science has emerged, with quantum data, quantum models, and quantum computational devices. This field, called quantum machine learning (QML), aims to achieve a speedup over traditional machine learning for data analysis. However, its success usually hinges on efficiently training the parameters in quantum neural networks, and the field of QML is still lacking theoretical scaling results for their trainability. Some trainability results have been proven for a closely related field called variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). While both fields involve training a parametrized quantum circuit, there are crucial differences that make the results for one setting not readily applicable to the other. In this work, we bridge the two frameworks and show that gradient scaling results for VQAs can also be applied to study the gradient scaling of QML models. Our results indicate that features deemed detrimental for VQA trainability can also lead to issues such as barren plateaus in QML. Consequently, our work has implications for several QML proposals in the literature. In addition, we provide theoretical and numerical evidence that QML models exhibit further trainability issues not present in VQAs, arising from the use of a training dataset. We refer to these as dataset-induced barren plateaus. These results are most relevant when dealing with classical data, as here the choice of embedding scheme (i.e., the map between classical data and quantum states) can greatly affect the gradient scaling.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe medical information system is rich in datasets, but no intelligent systems can easily analyse the disease. Recently, ML (Machine Learning)‐based algorithms have acted as a handy diagnostic tool to identify whether a person is affected by thyroid or not. However, they produced classification with low accuracy and led to misclassification. Hence, the proposed system combines quantum computing with ML techniques to enhance computational power and precision. The system employs modified QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimisation) for feature selection since its searching performance is better than that of conventional PSO for selecting the optimum global position of the particle, thus selecting the relevant feature. Whereas, the QSVM (Quantum Support Vector Machine) is implemented for more accurate classification than classical SVM, as it tends to capture complex patterns in data produced due to high dimensional feature space applied by quantum kernel functions. This combination of modified QPSO and QSVM tends to increase the performance accuracy significantly. The efficiency of the proposed model is measured based on derivative parameters, such as F‐1‐score, recall, precision and accuracy, with corresponding confusion matrix and ROC. Further, the classification is compared with other traditional approaches to predict the accuracy of the proposed model with traditional methods.",

We find that typical phase classifiers based on deep neural networks are extremely vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: adding a tiny amount of carefully crafted noises into the original legitimate examples will cause the classifiers to make incorrect predictions at a notably high confidence level. Through the lens of activation maps, we find that some important underlying physical principles and symmetries remain to be adequately captured for classifiers with even near-perfect performance. This explains why adversarial perturbations exist for fooling these classifiers. In addition, we find that, after adversarial training the classifiers will become more consistent with physical laws and consequently more robust to certain kinds of adversarial perturbations. Our results provide valuable guidance for both theoretical and experimental future studies on applying machine learning techniques to condensed matter physics.",

It is often the case that high accuracy in prediction using a ML model, demands a large and costly training set. Various solutions and procedures have been presented to reduce this cost. These include methods such as Δ-ML, hierarchical-ML, and multifidelity machine learning (MFML). MFML combines various Δ-ML like sub-models for various fidelities according to a fixed scheme derived from the sparse grid combination technique. In this work we implement an optimization procedure to combine multifidelity models in a flexible scheme resulting in optimized MFML (o-MFML) that provides superior prediction capabilities. This hyperparameter optimization is carried out on a holdout validation set of the property of interest. This work benchmarks the o-MFML method in predicting the atomization energies on the QM7b dataset, and again in the prediction of excitation energies for three molecules of growing size. The results indicate that o-MFML is a strong methodological improvement over MFML and provides lower error of prediction. Even in cases of poor data distributions and lack of clear hierarchies among the fidelities, which were previously identified as issues for multifidelity methods, the o-MFML is advantageous for the prediction of quantum chemical properties.",

This research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the performance of known quantum–classical models, while having eight times fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters. These models represent advancements in quantum machine learning research and illuminate the path towards more accurate image classification systems.",

This interest has supported the development of a multitude of software frameworks (e.g. Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket) to implement, simulate, and execute quantum algorithms. Most of them allow us to define quantum circuits, run basic quantum algorithms, and access low-level primitives depending on the hardware such software is supposed to run. For most experiments, these frameworks have to be manually integrated within a larger machine learning software pipeline. The researcher is in charge of knowing different software packages, integrating them through the development of long code scripts, analyzing the results, and generating the plots. Long code often leads to erroneous applications, due to the average number of bugs growing proportional with respect to the program length. Moreover, other researchers will struggle to understand and reproduce the experiment, due to the need to be familiar with all the different software frameworks involved in the code script. We propose QuASK, an open-source quantum machine learning framework written in Python that aids the researcher in performing their experiments, with particular attention to quantum kernel techniques. QuASK can be used as a command-line tool to download datasets, pre-process them, quantum machine learning routines, analyze and visualize the results. QuASK implements most state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the data through quantum kernels, with the possibility to use projected kernels, (gradient-descent) trainable quantum kernels, and structure-optimized quantum kernels. Our framework can also be used as a library and integrated into pre-existing software, maximizing code reuse.",

        "abstract": "The usage of QNNs is one approach that might be used to close the knowledge gap that exists between the domains of machine learning and quantum computing. As a result of this research, a full analysis of QNNs has been offered, covering a wide range of issues including their theoretical underpinnings, training techniques, benefits, limits, applications, and assessment methodologies. Quantum neural networks, also known as QNNs, are a type of artificial neural network that makes use of the power of quantum computing. These networks provide the promise for a significant improvement in processing speed as well as greater representation capabilities. On the other hand, in order to make full advantage of the benefits that QNNs give, obstacles such as scalability concerns and hardware restrictions need to be addressed and fixed. The fact that QNNs have the potential to be applied in such a broad range of different sectors is evidence of both the adaptability and the significance of this rapidly developing field of study. It will be necessary to do more study and investigation if there is to be any hope of making headway in the field of quantum machine learning with regard to the creation of QNNs and of realizing their full potential.",

In this study, we demonstrate the recognition of OAM Bell states using interference patterns generated by a classical light source and a single-photon source from a Sagnac interferometer-based OAM Bell state evolution device. The interference patterns exhibit a one-to-one correspondence with the input Bell states, providing conclusive evidence for the full recognition of OAM Bell states. Furthermore, we introduce machine learning to the field of Bell state recognition by proposing a neural network model capable of accurately recognizing higher order single-photon OAM Bell states, even in the undersampling case. In particular, the model’s training set includes interference patterns of OAM Bell states generated by classical light sources, yet it is able to recognize single-photon OAM Bell states with high accuracy, without relying on quantum resources during training. Our innovative application of neural networks to the recognition of single-photon OAM Bell states not only circumvents the resource consumption and experimental difficulties associated with quantum light sources but also facilitates the study of OAM-based quantum information.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the diversification of consumer values has led to an increase in the number of small-quantity, high-mix products. For many manufacturing companies, shipping inspections of such products are of great importance. As all products have the same value, good and defective products need to be efficiently identified. Now, a promising future application of quantum technology is considered to be quantum machine learning. We believe that the quantum classifier for SVMs using quantum kernels is one of the areas where quantum advantages can be demonstrated. At present, there are few examples of quantum classifiers applied to real problems in manufacturing processes. In this study, we aim to build a classifier that can demonstrate the quantum advantage and compare SVMs using classical and quantum kernels with conventional ResNet. Initially, a binarised image was generated after image pre-processing. After principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction were performed on the images, SVM with kernels was carried out. The kernel-based SVMs was then compared with the conventionally implemented Residual neural network (ResNet) using an evaluation index: F1-score. The results showed that the F1-score of SVMs using classical kernels was equivalent to that of Resnet. In addition, SVMs using quantum kernels showed higher F1-score than ResNet. In addition, the impact of the feature map and principal components of the quantum kernel was also investigated. It was found that when the feature map became more complex, conversely, circuit generation took more time. It was also found that the principal components are highly relevant to the image and cannot lead to simple results. In the future, we plan to accumulate more experimental data, look for scenes where quantum machine learning can be used and apply it to the manufacturing field.  ",

The experimental results suggest that our model outperforms previous models in terms of scope of applications and robustness. Additionally, we establish a new learning algorithm to solve parameters in HQMM by relating the quantum conditional master equation to the HQMM.

Quantum machine learning algorithms based on variational quantum circuits are run on freely available quantum computing hardware, showing very good performances as compared to deep neural networks run on classical computing facilities. In particular, we show that such kind of quantum neural networks is able to correctly classify the targeted signal with an Area Under the characteristic Curve (AUC) that is very close to the one obtained with the corresponding classical neural network, but employing a much lower number of resources, as well as less variable data in the training set.

The idea of ML was quite simple, merging two separate fields, Mathematics and Computer Science. This simple idea is the very reason that so many predictive and classification-based applications exist today. The development of such applications is a time-consuming process and is very computationally heavy because in the corporate world, a very large amount of historical data is used and processed. The training processes such as pre-processing, data engineering and transformations, deep learning, training and testing are themselves time consuming. A very new field of computer science deals with solving this exact problem of time consumption. Quantum Computing (QC) tries to solve these problems by using the concepts of Quantum Mechanics during computations. The QC technology claims to be not only fast in its computational speed but also more efficient and accurate as well. The following article consists of an experiment conducted where a machine learning model is trained in a classical computing environment using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm versus in a quantum computing environment using Quantum K-Nearest Neighbors (QKNN) algorithm.",

Variational QML algorithms have the potential to solve practical problems on real hardware, particularly when involving quantum data. However, training these algorithms can be challenging and calls for tailored optimization procedures. Specifically, QML applications can require a large shot-count overhead due to the large datasets involved. In this work, we advocate for simultaneous random sampling over both the dataset as well as the measurement operators that define the loss function. We consider a highly general loss function that encompasses many QML applications, and we show how to construct an unbiased estimator of its gradient. This allows us to propose a shot-frugal gradient descent optimizer called Refoqus (REsource Frugal Optimizer for QUantum Stochastic gradient descent). Our numerics indicate that Refoqus can save several orders of magnitude in shot cost, even relative to optimizers that sample over measurement operators alone.",

However, the community should focus on developing high-throughput simulation tools that utilize molecular dynamics capabilities for thorough exploration of the complex potential energy surfaces that exist, particularly in heterogeneous catalysis. Catalyst-specific databases should be developed to contain enough data to represent the complex multi-dimensional space that defines structure-function relationships. Machine learning tools will continue to impact rational catalyst design; however, we believe that more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms would yield better understanding of structure-function relationships for heterogeneous catalysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHybrid quantum-classical classifiers promise to positively impact critical aspects of natural language processing tasks, particularly classification-related ones. Among the possibilities currently investigated, quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage. This work shows potential advantages, in terms of both performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical linguistics task—acceptability judgements. Acceptability judgement is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgement. The evaluation phase shows results for the quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers’ capabilities to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrently available quantum computers suffer from constraints including hardware noise and a limited number of qubits. As such, variational quantum algorithms that utilise a classical optimiser in order to train a parameterised quantum circuit have drawn significant attention for near-term practical applications of quantum technology. In this work, we take a probabilistic point of view and reformulate the classical optimisation as an approximation of a Bayesian posterior. The posterior is induced by combining the cost function to be minimised with a prior distribution over the parameters of the quantum circuit. We describe a dimension reduction strategy based on a maximum a posteriori point estimate with a Laplace prior. Experiments on the Quantinuum H1-2 computer show that the resulting circuits are faster to execute and less noisy than the circuits trained without the dimension reduction strategy. We subsequently describe a posterior sampling strategy based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. Numerical simulations on three different problems show that the strategy is capable of generating samples from the full posterior and avoiding local optima.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGenerative modeling is an unsupervised machine learning framework, that exhibits strong performance in various machine learning tasks. Recently, we find several quantum versions of generative model, some of which are even proven to have quantum advantage. However, those methods are not directly applicable to construct a generative model for learning a set of quantum states, i.e., ensemble. In this paper, we propose a quantum generative model that can learn quantum ensemble, in an unsupervised machine learning framework. The key idea is to introduce a new loss function calculated based on optimal transport loss, which have been widely used in classical machine learning due to its good properties; e.g., no need to ensure the common support of two ensembles. We then give in-depth analysis on this measure, such as the scaling property of the approximation error. We also demonstrate the generative modeling with the application to quantum anomaly detection problem, that cannot be handled via existing methods. The proposed model paves the way for a wide application such as the health check of quantum devices and efficient initialization of quantum computation.",

        "abstract": "Quantum computing has been proven to excel in factorization issues and unordered search problems due to its capability of quantum parallelism. This unique feature allows exponential speed-up in solving certain problems. However, this advantage does not apply universally, and challenges arise when combining classical and quantum computing to achieve acceleration in computation speed. This paper aims to address these challenges by exploring the current state of quantum machine learning and benchmarking the performance of quantum and classical algorithms in terms of accuracy. Specifically, we conducted experiments with three datasets for binary classification, implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Quantum SVM (QSVM) algorithms. Our findings suggest that the QSVM algorithm outperforms classical SVM on complex datasets, and the performance gap between quantum and classical models increases with dataset complexity, as simple models tend to overfit with complex datasets. While there is still a long way to go in terms of developing quantum hardware with sufficient resources, quantum machine learning holds great potential in areas such as unsupervised learning and generative models. Moving forward, more efforts are needed to explore new quantum learning models that can leverage the power of quantum mechanics to overcome the limitations of classical machine learning.",

Starting with common methods in machine learning, the feature selection task is treated as a quadratic unconstrained optimisation problem (QUBO), which can be tackled with classical numerical methods as well as within a quantum computing framework. The different results in small problem instances are compared. According to the results of the authors’ study, whether the QUBO method outperforms other feature selection methods depends on the data set. In an extension to a larger data set with 27 features, the authors compare the convergence behaviour of the QUBO methods via quantum computing with classical stochastic optimisation methods.

On the other hand, machine learning has become an essential method for solving many problems such as computer vision, natural language processing, prediction and classification. Quantum machine learning is a new field developed by combining the advantages of these two primary methods. As a hybrid approach to quantum and classical computing, variational quantum circuits are a form of machine learning that allows predicting an output value against input variables. In this study, the effects of superposition and entanglement on weather forecasting, were investigated using a variational quantum circuit model when the dataset size is small. The use of the entanglement layer between the variational layers has made significant improvements on the circuit performance. The use of the superposition layer before the data encoding layer resulted in the use of less variational layers.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the applicability of quantum machine learning for classification tasks using two quantum classifiers from the Qiskit Python environment: the variational quantum circuit and the quantum kernel estimator (QKE). We provide a first evaluation on the performance of these classifiers when using a hyperparameter search on six widely known and publicly available benchmark datasets and analyze how their performance varies with the number of samples on two artificially generated test classification datasets. As quantum machine learning is based on unitary transformations, this paper explores data structures and application fields that could be particularly suitable for quantum advantages. Hereby, this paper introduces a novel dataset based on concepts from quantum mechanics using the exponential map of a Lie algebra. This dataset will be made publicly available and contributes a novel contribution to the empirical evaluation of quantum supremacy. We further compared the performance of VQC and QKE on six widely applicable datasets to contextualize our results. Our results demonstrate that the VQC and QKE perform better than basic machine learning algorithms, such as advanced linear regression models (Ridge and Lasso). They do not match the accuracy and runtime performance of sophisticated modern boosting classifiers such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. Therefore, we conclude that while quantum machine learning algorithms have the potential to surpass classical machine learning methods in the future, especially when physical quantum infrastructure becomes widely available, they currently lag behind classical approaches. Our investigations also show that classical machine learning approaches have superior performance classifying datasets based on group structures, compared to quantum approaches that particularly use unitary processes. Furthermore, our findings highlight the significant impact of different quantum simulators, feature maps, and quantum circuits on the performance of the employed quantum estimators. This observation emphasizes the need for researchers to provide detailed explanations of their hyperparameter choices for quantum machine learning algorithms, as this aspect is currently overlooked in many studies within the field. To facilitate further research in this area and ensure the transparency of our study, we have made the complete code available in a linked GitHub repository.",

Relevant results are presented by performing various methods viz. indexing and crawling and the output of these processes is the retrieved results that have to pass through the ranking process which is the central goal of information retrieval systems. The ranking is carried out through the classification or clustering of processed results which can include redundant and noisy features. The accuracy of classification or clusters for the ranking process can be maximized by removing noisy and duplicate features through the feature selection method. Although feature selection is an expensive computational process, after many decades, quantum computation tools are in use for many algorithms to implement realistic problems, particularly in the standard of Quantum Annealing. This paper focuses to prospect the standard of quantum computing in order to increase the quality of information classes through the feature selection method.

Unfortunately, these models do not protect the privacy necessary within commercial settings, prohibiting the use of potentially extremely valuable data by others. Encrypting the prediction process can solve this problem by double-blind model evaluation and prohibits the extraction of training or query data. However, contemporary ML models based on fully homomorphic encryption or federated learning are either too expensive for practical use or have to trade higher speed for weaker security. We have implemented secure and computationally feasible encrypted ML models using oblivious transfer enabling and secure predictions of molecular quantum properties across chemical compound space. However, we find that encrypted predictions using kernel ridge regression models are a million times more expensive than without encryption. This demonstrates a dire need for a compact ML model architecture, including molecular representation and kernel matrix size, that minimizes model evaluation costs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nQuantum computers promise to enhance machine learning for practical applications. Quantum machine learning for real-world data has to handle extensive amounts of high-dimensional data. However, conventional methods for measuring quantum kernels are impractical for large datasets as they scale with the square of the dataset size. Here, we measure quantum kernels using randomized measurements. The quantum computation time scales linearly with dataset size and quadratic for classical post-processing. While our method scales in general exponentially in qubit number, we gain a substantial speed-up when running on intermediate-sized quantum computers. Further, we efficiently encode high-dimensional data into quantum computers with the number of features scaling linearly with the circuit depth. The encoding is characterized by the quantum Fisher information metric and is related to the radial basis function kernel. Our approach is robust to noise via a cost-free error mitigation scheme. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods for noisy quantum computers by classifying images with the IBM quantum computer. To achieve further speedups we distribute the quantum computational tasks between different quantum computers. Our method enables benchmarking of quantum machine learning algorithms with large datasets on currently available quantum computers.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn-depth theoretical and practical research is nowadays being performed on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which have the potential to surpass traditional, classical, algorithms on a variety of problems, in physics, chemistry, biology, and optimization. Because they are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, it takes a certain set of optimal conditions for their full potential to be exploited. For VQAs, the construction of an appropriate ansatz in particular is crucial, since it lays the ground for efficiently solving the particular problem being addressed. To prevent severe negative effects that hamper quantum computation, the substantial noise, together with the structural limitations, characteristic of currently available devices must be also taken into consideration while building the ansatz. In this work the effect of the quantum hardware structure, namely the topological properties emerging from the couplings between the physical qubits and the basis gates of the device itself, on the performances of VQAs is addressed. Specifically, it is here experimentally shown that a complex connectivity in the ansatz, albeit being beneficial for exploring wider sets of solutions, introduces an overhead of gates during the transpilation on a quantum computer that increases the overall error rate, thus undermining the quality of the training. It is hence necessary, when implementing a variation quantum learning algorithm, to find the right balance between a sufficiently parametrized ansatz and a minimal cost in terms of resources during transpilation. Moreover, the experimental finding allows to construct a heuristic metric function, which aids the decision-making process on the best possible ansatz structure to be deployed on a given quantum hardware, thus fostering a more efficient application of VQAs in realistic situations. The experiments are performed on two widely used variational algorithms, the VQE (variational quantum eigensolver) and the VQC (variational quantum classifier), both tested on two different problems, the first on the Markowitz portfolio optimization using real-world financial data, and the latter on a classification task performed on the Iris dataset.",

        "abstract": "AbstractTensor network quantum machine learning (QML) models are promising applications on near-term quantum hardware. While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced.",

        "abstract": "Despite its undeniable success, classical machine learning remains a resource-intensive process. Practical computational efforts for training state-of-the-art models can now only be handled by high speed computer hardware. As this trend is expected to continue, it should come as no surprise that an increasing number of machine learning researchers are investigating the possible advantages of quantum computing. The scientific literature on Quantum Machine Learning is now enormous, and a review of its current state that can be comprehended without a physics background is necessary. The objective of this study is to present a review of Quantum Machine Learning from the perspective of conventional techniques. Departing from giving a research path from fundamental quantum theory through Quantum Machine Learning algorithms from a computer scientist’s perspective, we discuss a set of basic algorithms for Quantum Machine Learning, which are the fundamental components for Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. We implement the Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) on a quantum computer to recognize handwritten digits, and compare its performance to that of its classical counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, we implement the QSVM on the breast cancer dataset and compare it to the classical SVM. Finally, we implement the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and many classical classifiers on the Iris dataset to compare their accuracies.",
