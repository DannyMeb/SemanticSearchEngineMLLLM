        "abstract": "The large military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has consequences for the global financial market. The European region is one of the hardest hits, which experienced a high energy cost and devaluation of the currency. This paper investigates the Employment Expectations Indicator (EEI) and Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) from the business consumer survey index to reflect the reaction of the consumers of the European market by implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. In the object, the monetary policy decisions from European Central Bank are considered the data set for forecasting the Index. In the result, all nine models from scikit-learn contributed a great job in both categories of Accuracy, Precision, and F-score and Recall with a level of 90% as average. It represents that the NLP techniques effectively forecast the future value of two European business and consumer indexes. However, the limit of the dataset and model mostly related to the performance of NLP techniques is working for forecasting but less related to the expected values of the EEI and ESI indices. Future research would focus more on forecasting the expected value of the two indexes and reflect the consumers' reactions in the markets.",

Data over the period of 2016–2020 that are relevant to financial reporting and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting have been extracted for 208 firms in the ICT industry. Important variables have been identified to help predict the financial performance in the following years upon the publication of CSR reports. Drawing on resource‐based view and stakeholder theory, the purpose of this study is to find the quintessential variables that influence the prediction accuracy of financial performance. To better forecast earnings per share (EPS), machine learning feature selection methods have been implemented. The findings suggest that certain variables such as return on total assets, SDGs adoption and whether the firm has established KPI for SDGs achievements can help enhance EPS prediction. With the various predictive models, the artificial neural network model is the most effective in predicting CFPs. Most importantly, the adoption of SDGs can be utilized to sharpen the forecast on financial performance as it enables firms to bolster stakeholder engagement and evaluate environmental, social, and corporate governance efforts.",

Daily financial market indices and price observations are used to assess the forecasting models. We compare statistical, machine learning, and deep learning forecasting models to evaluate the financial markets, such as the ARIMA, hybrid ETS-ANN, and kNN predictive models. The study results indicate that predicting financial market fluctuations is challenging, and the accuracy levels are generally low in several instances. ARIMA and hybrid ETS-ANN models perform better over extended periods compared to the kNN model, with ARIMA being the best-performing model in 2018–2021 and the hybrid ETS-ANN model being the best-performing model in most of the other subperiods. Still, the kNN model outperforms the others in several periods, depending on the observed accuracy measure. Researchers have advocated using parametric and non-parametric modeling combinations to generate better results. In this study, the results suggest that the hybrid ETS-ANN model is the best-performing model despite its moderate level of accuracy. Thus, the hybrid ETS-ANN model is a promising financial time series forecasting approach. The findings offer financial analysts an additional source that can provide valuable insights for investment decisions.",

One of the solutions to control the death rate and cases is to forecast the cases number. This study proposed ensemble forecasting that build from several penalized regressions. Penalized regressions are able to overcome linear regression analysis’ shortcomings by using penalty values, that will affect regression’s coefficient, resulting on regression model with a slight bias in order to reduce parameter estimations and prediction values' variances. Penalized regressions are evaluated and built as ensemble forecasting method to minimize the shortcomings of other existing model, so it could produce more accurate values comparing to single penalized regression model. The result showed that the ensemble model `consists of smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and Elastic-net is sufficient to capture data patterns with root mean squared error (RMSE) 6.38. </span></p>",

Ones of the considerable problems of solar and wind systems, they depend on the weather, as compared to the conventional generation. As we know, the balance in managing load and generated power in energy system is very import ant. If the power which is supplied from solar and wind perfectly predictable, the extra cost of operating power system with a large penetration of renewable energy will be reduced. Since, the accurate and reliable forecasting system for renewable sources represents an important topic as a major contribution for increasing non-programmable renewable on over the world. The target of this research is to describe the advanced hybrid evolutionary techniques of computational intelligence applied for PV as well as wind power forecast. The evaluation of this investigation is obtained by comparing different definitions of the forecasting error. Moreover, the meaning of NWP (numerical weather prediction) values based on meteorological information on solar and wind power forecasting at Indore has been highlighted in this research.",

To provide an insight into the trends in AI and ML in health care, we conducted an international patent analysis.\n\n\nObjective\nIt is pivotal to obtain a clear overview on upcoming AI and MLtrends in health care to provide regulators with a better position to foresee what technologies they will have to create regulations for, which are not yet available on the market. Therefore, in this study, we provide insights and forecasts into the trends in AI and ML in health care by conducting an international patent analysis.\n\n\nMethods\nA systematic patent analysis, focusing on AI- and ML-based patents in health care, was performed using the Espacenet database (from January 2012 until July 2022). This database includes patents from the China National Intellectual Property Administration, European Patent Office, Japan Patent Office, Korean Intellectual Property Office, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified 10,967 patents: 7332 (66.9%) from the China National Intellectual Property Administration, 191 (1.7%) from the European Patent Office, 163 (1.5%) from the Japan Patent Office, 513 (4.7%) from the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and 2768 (25.2%) from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The number of published patents showed a yearly doubling from 2015 until 2021. Five international companies that had the greatest impact on this increase were Ping An Medical and Healthcare Management Co Ltd with 568 (5.2%) patents, Siemens Healthineers with 273 (2.5%) patents, IBM Corp with 226 (2.1%) patents, Philips Healthcare with 150 (1.4%) patents, and Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co Ltd with 144 (1.3%) patents.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis international patent analysis showed a linear increase in patents published by the 5 largest patent offices. An open access database with interactive search options was launched for AI- and ML-based patents in health care.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractIntraday financial data often take the form of a collection of curves that can be observed sequentially over time, such as intraday stock price curves. These curves can be viewed as a time series of functions observed on equally spaced and dense grids. Due to the curse of dimensionality, high‐dimensional data pose challenges from a statistical aspect; however, it also provides opportunities to analyze a rich source of information so that the dynamic changes within short‐time intervals can be better understood. We consider a sieve bootstrap method to construct 1‐day‐ahead point and interval forecasts in a model‐free way. As we sequentially observe new data, we also implement two dynamic updating methods to update point and interval forecasts for achieving improved accuracy. The forecasting methods are validated through an empirical study of 5‐min cumulative intraday returns of the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Index.",

The proposed framework incorporates a nonlinear threshold regression specification to consider the leverage effect and model the contemporaneous dependence between the observed realized measure and hidden volatility. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method is adapted and employed for model estimation, with its validity assessed via a simulation study. The validity of incorporating the proposed measurement equation in Realized‐GARCH type models is evaluated via an empirical study, forecasting the 1% and 2.5% Value‐at‐Risk and expected shortfall on six market indices with two different out‐of‐sample sizes. The proposed framework is shown to be capable of producing competitive tail risk forecasting results in comparison with the GARCH and Realized‐GARCH type models.",

        "abstract": "The article analyzes and builds economic and mathematical models for forecasting the main segments of the financial market of Ukraine:: the banking market; stock market; insurance market.  The role of the financial market in modern civilized society is huge. Its functions include the mobilization of capital, its distribution among industries, control and support of the reproductive process, as well as increasing the efficiency of the economic system as a whole. The turning point for the Ukrainian financial market was 2022, namely the beginning of a full-scale Russian invasion, which led to the isolation of the financial market of Ukraine due to the introduction of martial law. In order to identify the key challenges for the development of the financial market, it is necessary to forecast the dynamics of its main segments using the tools of economic and mathematical modeling.  A feature of the development of the domestic financial market is that the main part of the state’s financial resources is concentrated in such subjects of the financial system as deposit (commercial) banks; non-deposit financial intermediaries (insurance companies); subsidiary financial corporations (stock exchanges). According to the constructed forecasting models, it can be concluded that, all things being equal, in 2023 and 2024, the tendency to decrease the number of operating banks will continue and will be 59 and 54, respectively. As for the share of commercial banks with domestic capital, it will remain at the same level in 2023 and decrease by 4% in 2024. The number of insurance companies will decrease to 111 in 2023 and increase by 8 in 2024. Regarding the size of their assets, in 2023 there will be a decrease to the level of UAH 68,557 million, and a slight increase to the level of UAH 69,283 million in 2024. The share of the exchange market in the total volume of trades on the securities market will increase to 62% in 2022 and to 66% in 2023.",

More businesses are using AI in curriculum vitae (CV) screening. While the move improves efficiency in the recruitment process, it is vulnerable to biases, which have adverse effects on organizations and the broader society. This research aims to analyze case studies on AI hiring to demonstrate both successful implementations and instances of bias. It also seeks to evaluate the impact of algorithmic bias and the strategies to mitigate it. The basic design of the study entails undertaking a systematic review of existing literature and research studies that focus on artificial intelligence techniques employed to mitigate bias in hiring. The results demonstrate that the correction of the vector space and data augmentation are effective natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques for mitigating algorithmic bias in hiring. The findings underscore the potential of artificial intelligence techniques in promoting fairness and diversity in the hiring process with the application of artificial intelligence techniques. The study contributes to human resource practice by enhancing hiring algorithms’ fairness. It recommends the need for collaboration between machines and humans to enhance the fairness of the hiring process. The results can help AI developers make algorithmic changes needed to enhance fairness in AI-driven tools. This will enable the development of ethical hiring tools, contributing to fairness in society.",

We analyze the asset allocations performed and test different portfolio strategies, such as maximum Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, and minimum conditional value at risk. Using international financial market indices, we specify the regular, drawable, and canonical vine copulas, such as the Gaussian, Student's \n, Clayton, Frank, Joe, Gumbel, and mixed copulas, and analyze both in‐sample and out‐of‐sample portfolio performances. Out‐of‐sample portfolio back‐testing shows that vine copulas reduce portfolio risk better than the benchmark portfolio strategies and also better than simple multivariate copulas. Overall, we find that mixed vine copula models perform best with regard to risk reduction, both for the entire period 2001–2022 and during financial crises periods. Thus, a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric copula families works best in terms of portfolio risk reduction irrespective of the chosen optimization approach.",

        "abstract": "<p>Predicting commodity prices, particularly food prices, is a significant concern for various stakeholders, especially in regions that are highly sensitive to commodity price volatility. Historically, many machine learning models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) have been suggested to overcome the forecasting task. These models struggle to capture the multifaceted and dynamic factors influencing these prices. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated considerable promise in handling complex forecasting tasks. This paper presents a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based model for commodity price forecasting. The model uses five essential commodities namely bread, meat, milk, oil, and petrol. The proposed model focuses on advanced feature engineering which involves moving averages, price volatility, and past prices. The results reveal that our model outperforms traditional methods as it achieves 0.14, 3.04%, and 98.2% for root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared (R<sup>2</sup>), respectively. In addition to the simplicity of the model, which consists of an LSTM single-cell architecture that reduced the training time to a few minutes instead of hours. This paper contributes to the economic literature on price prediction using advanced deep learning techniques as well as provides practical implications for managing commodity price instability globally.</p>",

        "abstract": "Corporate credit ratings provide multiple strategic, financial, and managerial benefits for decision-makers. Therefore, it is essential to have accurate and up-to-date ratings to continuously monitor companies’ financial situations when making financial credit decisions. Machine learning (ML)-based internal models can be used for the assessment of companies’ financial situations using annual statements. Particularly, it is necessary to check whether these ML models achieve better results compared to statistical methods. Due to the multi-class classification problem when forecasting corporate credit ratings, the development, monitoring, and maintenance of ML-based systems are more challenging compared to simple classifications. This problem becomes even more complex due to the required coordination with financial regulators (e.g., OECD, EBA, BaFin, etc.). Furthermore, the ML models must be updated regularly due to the periodic nature of annual statements as a dataset. To address the problem of the limited dataset, multiple sampling strategies and machine learning algorithms can be combined for accurate and up-to-date forecasting of credit ratings. This paper provides various implications for ML-based forecasting of credit ratings and presents an approach for combining sampling strategies and ML techniques. It also provides design recommendations for ML-based services in the finance industry on how to fulfill the existing regulations.",

Deep learning is a method of realising computer vision using image recognition and object detection technologies. Since its emergence, computer vision has evolved rapidly with the development of deep learning and has significantly improved image recognition accuracy. Moreover, an expert system can imitate and reproduce the flow of reasoning and decision making executed in human experts’ brains to derive optimal solutions. Machine learning, including deep learning, has made it possible to ‘acquire the tacit knowledge of experts’, which was not previously achievable with conventional expert systems. Machine learning ‘systematises tacit knowledge’ based on big data and measures phenomena from multiple angles and in large quantities. In this review, we discuss some knowledge-based computer vision techniques that employ deep learning.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe validity of asset pricing models implies white‐noise pricing errors (PEs). However, we find that the PEs of six well‐known factor models all exhibit a significant reversal pattern and are predictable by their lagged values up to 12 months. Moreover, the predictability of the PEs can produce substantial economic profits. Similar conclusions hold for recently developed machine learning models too. Additional analysis reveals that the significant PE profits cannot be explained by common behavioral biases. Our results imply that much remains to be done and there is a great need to develop new asset pricing models.",

        "abstract": "Securing online financial transactions has become a critical concern in an era where financial services are becoming more and more digital. The transition to digital platforms for conducting daily transactions exposed customers to possible risks from cybercriminals. This study proposed a framework that combines multi-factor authentication and machine learning to increase the safety of online financial transactions. Our methodology is based on using two layers of security. The first layer incorporates two factors to authenticate users. The second layer utilizes a machine learning component, which is triggered when the system detects a potential fraud. This machine learning layer employs facial recognition as a decisive authentication factor for further protection. To build the machine learning model, four supervised classifiers were tested: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and naive Bayes. The results showed that the accuracy of each classifier was 97.938%, 97.881%, 96.717%, and 92.354%, respectively. This study’s superiority is due to its methodology, which integrates machine learning as an embedded layer in a multi-factor authentication framework to address usability, efficacy, and the dynamic nature of various e-commerce platform features. With the evolving financial landscape, a continuous exploration of authentication factors and datasets to enhance and adapt security measures will be considered in future work.",

Accurate prediction of financial distress not only helps to safeguard the interests of investors but also improves the ability of managers to manage financial risks. Prior studies predominantly rely on accounting metrics derived from financial statements to predict financial distress. Our research takes a step further by incorporating media news to enhance the accuracy of financial distress prediction. Based on the data from Chinese listed companies, seven classifiers are established to verify the additional value of media news in improving the financial distress prediction performance of models. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of media news in predictive models is effective as it contributes to better performance compared with models that solely rely on accounting features. Moreover, random forest model is a reliable tool in financial distress prediction due to its superior ability to capture complex feature relationships. Evaluation indicators, statistical tests, and Bayesian A/B tests further confirm that the inclusion of media news can significantly improve the identification of financially distressed companies.",

This paper combines social responsibility indicators with financial, management, and textual indicators to construct a multi‐dimensional FDP index system. To increase prediction accuracy, the difference in the number of samples between special treatment and health companies is actively considered, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique is adopted to deal with class‐imbalanced datasets. Moreover, a feature extraction method based on the genetic algorithm is employed to select features as input of machine learning models for predicting financial distress in Chinese listed companies. Experimental results show that ensemble classifiers are the better choice for predicting financial distress, of which gradient boosting decision tree outperforms other classifiers. Textual indicators play the most significant role in complementing traditional financial indicators of FDP, and their financial distress signals emerge earlier compared with management and social responsibility indicators.",

To that end, it uses shadow rates as a proxy measure of unconventional monetary policy actions and a financial stress index as an indicator of financial instability. We apply a global vector autoregressive model and present the outcome of impulse response functions and forecasts of macroeconomic and financial stress variables. Our results show that US output and inflation are positively affected in response to a domestic negative monetary policy shock, whereas financial stress is unresponsive to the same shock. This policy also has international effects, as we find significant spillovers with the US interest rate shock impacting inflation abroad.

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper compares several methods for constructing weekly nowcasts of recession probabilities in Italy, with a focus on the most recent period of the Covid‐19 pandemic. The common thread of these methods is that they use, in different ways, the information content provided by financial market data. In particular, a battery of probit models are estimated after extracting information from a large dataset of more than 130 financial market variables observed at a weekly frequency. The accuracy of these models is explored in a pseudo out‐of‐sample nowcasting exercise. The results demonstrate that nowcasts derived from probit models estimated on a large set of financial variables are, on average, more accurate than those delivered by standard probit models estimated on a single financial covariate, such as the slope of the yield curve. The proposed approach performs well even compared with probit models estimated on single time series of real economic activity variables, such as industrial production, business tendency survey data or composite PMI indicators. Overall, the financial indicators used in this paper can be easily updated as soon as new data become available on a weekly basis, thus providing reliable early estimates of the Italian business cycle.",

        "abstract": "This article examines emerging legal issues and theories of liability for directors involved in the management of AI financial instruments that are protected as trade secrets. The main question of the article is whether excessive delegation of functions or lack of transparency of AI algorithms can undermine the performance of fiduciary duties by directors. By reviewing case law in the context of strict oversight of past technological failures, the article proposes a renewed approach to the use of blockchain tools that will maintain efficiency benefits while ensuring necessary reporting and accountability. The study suggests that governance based on the principles of auditing AI performance and setting minimum standards for explainability can help strike a balance between driving innovation, addressing liability issues, and aligning with modern doctrines that hold boards accountable for key decision-making. new technologies. As algorithms become increasingly integrated into senior management decision-making processes, there is a need to further explore transparency mechanisms and monitoring processes that will support evolving fiduciary responsibilities in relation to evolving automation capabilities that impact shareholder interests.",

        "abstract": "The issue of road traffic congestion has become increasingly apparent in modern times. With the rise of urbanization, technological advancements, and an increase in the number of vehicles on the road, almost all major cities are experiencing poor traffic environments and low road efficiency. To address this problem, researchers have turned to diverse data resources and focused on predicting traffic flow, a crucial issue in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that can help alleviate congestion. By analyzing data from correlated roads and vehicles, such as speed, density, and flow rate, it is possible to anticipate traffic congestion and patterns. This paper presents an adaptive traffic system that utilizes supervised machine learning and big data analytics to predict traffic flow. The system monitors and extracts relevant traffic flow data, analyzes and processes the data, and stores it to enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness. A simulation was conducted by the authors to showcase the proposed solution. The outcomes of the study carry substantial implications for transportation systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing traffic flow management.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA novel forecast combination and weighted quantile‐based tail risk forecasting framework is proposed, aiming to reduce the impact of modeling uncertainty. The proposed approach is based on a two‐step estimation procedure. The first step involves the combination of value‐at‐risk (VaR) forecasts at a grid of quantile levels. A range of parametric and semiparametric models is selected as the model universe in the forecast combination procedure. The quantile forecast combination weights are estimated by optimizing the quantile loss. In the second step, the expected shortfall (ES) is computed as a weighted average of combined quantiles. The quantiles weighting structure for ES forecasting is determined by minimizing a strictly consistent joint VaR and ES loss function of the Fissler–Ziegel class. The proposed framework is applied to six stock market indices and its forecasting performance is compared to each individual model in the universe, a simple average approach and a weighted quantile approach. The forecasting results support the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Channel state information in millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications systems is vital for various tasks ranging from planning the optimal locations of BSs to efficient beam tracking mechanisms to handover design. Due to the use of large-scale phased antenna arrays and high sensitivity to environmental geometry and materials, precise propagation models for these bands are obtained via ray-tracing modeling. However, the propagation conditions in mmWave/THz systems may theoretically change at very small distances, that is, 1 mm–1 μm, which requires extreme computational effort for modeling. In this paper, we first will assess the effective correlation distances in mmWave/THz systems for different outdoor scenarios, user mobility patterns, and line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (nLoS) conditions. As the metrics of interest, we utilize the angle of arrival/departure (AoA/AoD) and path loss of the first few strongest rays. Then, to reduce the computational efforts required for the ray-tracing procedure, we propose a methodology for the extrapolation and interpolation of these metrics based on the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model. The proposed methodology is based on a special representation of the channel state information in a form suitable for state-of-the-art video enhancement machine learning (ML) techniques, which allows for the use of their powerful prediction capabilities. To assess the prediction performance of the ConvLSTM model, we utilize precision and recall as the main metrics of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that the channel state correlation in AoA/AoD parameters is preserved up until approximately 0.3–0.6 m, which is 300–600 times larger than the wavelength at 300 GHz. The use of a ConvLSTM model allows us to accurately predict AoA and AoD angles up to the 0.6 m distance with AoA being characterized by a higher mean squared error (MSE). Our results can be utilized to speed up ray-tracing simulations by selecting the grid step size, resulting in the desired trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational time. Additionally, it can also be utilized to improve beam tracking in mmWave/THz systems via a selection of the time step between beam realignment procedures.",

        "abstract": "global Islamic finance industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, establishing Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) as prominent players in the international financial landscape. To maintain competitiveness and sustainability, IFIs must embrace innovation and explore avenues for maximising their performance. This research aims to investigate the effect of AI-based Chatbots on the value and profitability of IFIs in Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. The study has employed quantitative methodology, and the data was collected from the Bloomberg database, Thomson Reuters DataStream, World Development Indicators and annual reports of 104 IFIs across 44 OIC countries from 2020 to 2022. Employing the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM), this study investigates the impact of AI-based Chatbots on the value and profitability of IFIs. The findings show a positive impact of Chatbot on Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q (TBQ). Furthermore, the analysis reveals that variables such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), institutional size (SIZE), and age (AGE) exhibit positive associations with the value and profitability of IFIs. Conversely, the study identifies Consumer Price Index (CPI) as exerting a negative influence on the value and profitability of IFIs, indicating potential challenges posed by inflationary pressures. IFIs may consider investing in the development and deployment of advanced AI technologies to enhance overall profitability.

        "abstract": "<span lang=\"EN-US\">The significance of the agriculture sector in Malaysia is often overlooked, and there is a notable deficiency in the advancement of digitalization within the country's agricultural domain. The integration of a price forecasting model in the platform enables the relevant parties, including farmers, to make informed decisions and plan their crop selection based on projected future prices. In this research, the authors proposed the hybrid approach with the combination of linear model and non-linear model in doing the vegetable price forecasting model. The hybrid SARIMA-DWT-GANN model is utilized to forecast the monthly vegetable prices in Malaysia. The historical vegetable price data is collected from the FAMA Malaysia and split into training/test set for modelling. The performance of the models is evaluated on the accuracy metrics including MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. The forecasted results using the proposed hybrid model are compared to that using the single SARIMA model. In conclusion, the hybrid SARIMA-DWT-GANN model is superior to the individual model, which obtained the smaller MAE, RMSE, and got the forecast accuracy of at least 95%. </span>",

        "abstract": "The financial market model should be formed taking into account a clearly defined subject area and its objects, which is ensured by their classification and adequate representation in form. The described processes are significant since the type and forms of expression of the financial market form the basis for launching evaluation methods and forecasting its effectiveness through performance. The financial market classification consists of supplementing its model with the location and organization of its interrelated elements. It should be noted that for this purpose, systems for dividing objects into groups according to predetermined characteristics should be applied, in particular: 1) division of the financial market according to information about it (into groups, subgroups according to a particular characteristic); 2) allocation of logical connections between groups and subgroups of the financial market. These object distribution systems are based on the identification/construction of structures forming a combinatorial financial market model. The purpose of the article is the process of research the classification and forms of presentation of the financial market as a basis for evaluating transformational processes and forecasting their effectiveness through effectiveness. The process of researching the classification and forms of presentation of the financial market as a basis for evaluating transformational processes and forecasting its effectiveness through effectiveness is revealed. The main approaches to the classification of the financial market are characterized (by generalized, syncretic, and LOD approaches).  The structuring of the financial need based on the convergence of economic relations with the transfer of ownership and the specifics of the legislative regulation of this process is essential and provides the presentation of information in terms of such components as currency market, deposit market, credit market; Securities Market; derivatives market; real estate market. The outlined approach to structuring the financial market forms a conceptual understanding of its model as a system S, which reflects the basic structures necessary to determine the objects of assessment and directions of performance forecasting through performance. To ensure the practical applicability of the conceptual model, modeling procedures, methods and algorithms must be systematically characterized.",

        "abstract": "In today’s complex economic environment, individuals and households alike grapple with the challenge of financial planning. This paper introduces novel methodologies for both individual and cooperative (household) financial budgeting. We firstly propose an optimization framework for individual budget allocation, aiming to maximize savings by efficiently distributing monthly income among various expense categories. We then extend this model to households, wherein the complexity of handling multiple incomes and shared expenses is addressed. The cooperative model prioritizes not only maximized savings but also the preferences and needs of each member, fostering a harmonious financial environment, whether they are short-term needs or long-term aspirations. A notable innovation in our approach is the integration of recommendations from a large language model (LLM). Given its vast training data and potent inferential capabilities, the LLM provides initial feasible solutions to our optimization problems, acting as a guiding beacon for individuals and households unfamiliar with the nuances of financial planning. Our preliminary results indicate that the LLM-recommended solutions result in budget plans that are both economically sound, meaning that they are consistent with established financial management principles and promote fiscal resilience and stability, and aligned with the financial goals and preferences of the concerned parties. This integration of AI-driven recommendations with econometric models, as an instantiation of an extended coevolutionary (EC) theory, paves the way for a new era in financial planning, making it more accessible and effective for a wider audience, as we propose an example of a new theory in economics where human behavior can be greatly influenced by AI agents.",

Gastric emptying’s variability presents challenges to drug delivery systems, making gastroretentive drug delivery systems increasingly popular for retaining drugs in the stomach and ensuring gradual release. Traditional oral delivery systems often fail to overcome gastrointestinal obstacles, resulting in incomplete drug release, decreased efficacy. Thus, achieving prolonged gastric residence times is crucial, particularly for drugs with upper small intestine absorption windows. Gastro retentive drug delivery system provide for prolonged drug release in the upper digestive system, improving bioavailability for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows, extending dosing intervals, and enhancing patient compliance. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advancements in the preparation techniques for floating drug delivery systems and highlights the incorporation of AI-Enabled design and optimization in drug release behavior. These technologies enhance precision and efficiency in gastroretentive drug delivery systems development, promising further improvements in drug delivery effectiveness and patient adherence.",

        "abstract": "In this study, LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) techniques of deep learning, which are among the latest advanced technologies, were applied in the Google Colab software program for stock price forecasting. The dataset used in the study was obtained from Yahoo Finance and covers the dates between 02/01/2013 and 30/12/2022. Forecast models were created by considering 5 companies belonging to the XELKT (Electricity Market in Borsa Istanbul) index, which is part of BIST (Borsa Istanbul). Subsequently, the success of these forecast models was tested with the calculated model performance criteria, aiming to determine whether the techniques used were successful in stock price forecasting. Additionally, based on the results of MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) among the calculated model performance criteria, the techniques used were compared with each other, aiming to determine which of these techniques provided forecasts with less error. Then, through the analysis conducted on four different days, an attempt was made to identify the day that yielded the most successful forecasts. As a final step, the goal was to find a model with the least error based on techniques, epoch number, and the number of days forecasted, considering both MSE and MAPE for stocks. Since the model performance criteria outputs obtained from these analyses are below 1 for MSE and below 5% for MAPE, it can be concluded that both techniques demonstrate successful stock price forecasting. Consequently, in the comparison between these two techniques, it is observed that the LSTM technique is slightly more successful than the GRU technique.",

        "abstract": "This research endeavors to employ sales forecasting techniques on historical sales data for the purpose of determining the sales budget. The application of forecasting is based on sales data from the preceding period, utilizing a descriptive qualitative method. The analysis employs the half-average trend method, generating an estimated sales figure for the upcoming period. This estimate serves as a reference for both inventory planning and the formulation of the sales budget. Within this research, the half-average trend method involves the selection of two X parameter values, namely 0.5 and 0. To determine the superior value, a calculation of SKF (Standard Error of Forecasting) is executed. The analysis results reveal that utilizing the value 0 yields an SKF value of 4,166.6, while the value 0.5 produces a lower SKF value of 3,941.6. This implies that the estimated sales number with the X value of 0.5 is smaller than that with the X value of 0. Conclusively, the application of the half-average trend method in this research provides sales estimates for the next three months, contributing valuable insights for effective planning and budgeting processes.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis study attempts to accelerate the learning ability of an artificial electric field algorithm (AEFA) by attributing it with two mechanisms: elitism and opposition-based learning. Elitism advances the convergence of the AEFA towards global optima by retaining the fine-tuned solutions obtained thus far, and opposition-based learning helps enhance its exploration ability. The new version of the AEFA, called elitist opposition leaning-based AEFA (EOAEFA), retains the properties of the basic AEFA while taking advantage of both elitism and opposition-based learning. Hence, the improved version attempts to reach optimum solutions by enabling the diversification of solutions with guaranteed convergence. Higher-order neural networks (HONNs) have single-layer adjustable parameters, fast learning, a robust fault tolerance, and good approximation ability compared with multilayer neural networks. They consider a higher order of input signals, increased the dimensionality of inputs through functional expansion and could thus discriminate between them. However, determining the number of expansion units in HONNs along with their associated parameters (i.e., weight and threshold) is a bottleneck in the design of such networks. Here, we used EOAEFA to design two HONNs, namely, a pi-sigma neural network and a functional link artificial neural network, called EOAEFA-PSNN and EOAEFA-FLN, respectively, in a fully automated manner. The proposed models were evaluated on financial time-series datasets, focusing on predicting four closing prices, four exchange rates, and three energy prices. Experiments, comparative studies, and statistical tests were conducted to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Despite several solutions and experiments have been conducted recently addressing image super-resolution (SR), boosted by deep learning (DL), they do not usually design evaluations with high scaling factors. Moreover, the datasets are generally benchmarks which do not truly encompass significant diversity of domains to proper evaluate the techniques. It is also interesting to remark that blind SR is attractive for real-world scenarios since it is based on the idea that the degradation process is unknown, and, hence, techniques in this context rely basically on low-resolution (LR) images. In this article, we present a high-scale (8×) experiment which evaluates five recent DL techniques tailored for blind image SR: Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation (APA), Blind Image SR with Spatially Variant Degradations (BlindSR), Deep Alternating Network (DAN), FastGAN, and Mixture of Experts Super-Resolution (MoESR). We consider 14 datasets from five different broader domains (Aerial, Fauna, Flora, Medical, and Satellite), and another remark is that some of the DL approaches were designed for single-image SR but others not. Based on two no-reference metrics, NIQE and the transformer-based MANIQA score, MoESR can be regarded as the best solution although the perceptual quality of the created high-resolution (HR) images of all the techniques still needs to improve.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines how the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology can enable autonomous AI agents to engage and execute economic and financial transactions. We critically examine the constraints on AI agents in achieving predefined objectives independently, especially due to their limited access to economic and financial institutions. We argue that AI’s access to these institutions is vital in enhancing its capabilities to augment human productivity. Drawing on the theory of institutional economics, we propose that blockchain provides a solution for creating digital economic and financial institutions, permitting AI to engage with these institutions through the management of private keys. This extends AI’s capabilities to form and execute contracts, participate in marketplaces, and utilize financial services autonomously. The paper encourages further research on AI as a general-purpose technology and blockchain as an institutional technology that can unlock the full capabilities of autonomous AI agents.",

        "abstract": "<span lang=\"EN-US\">Financial Technology (FinTech) which is included in the development of digitalization in the financial sector in the industrial era 4.0. Fintech can make any transactions anywhere with the pillars of Peet-to-Peer (P2P) lending, merchants and crowdfunding. In the P2P Lending pillar, there are borrowers and lenders who are digitized in Fintech devices. Fintech in Indonesia is controlled by a state agency called the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan or Financial Services Authority (OJK). In the movement of P2P Lending, there are borrowers and lenders who can be said to be investors where these activities are reported to the OJK. This data can be forecasted using a neural network approach such as ECoS, which is a method capable of forecasting with learning that develops in the hidden layer. In this research article, we present results on forecasting borrowers with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.148% and forecasting lenders with an accuracy measurement with MAPE of 0.209% with a learning rate 1 = 0.6 and a learning rate 2 = 0.3. So, this forecasting model can be said as an optimization in FinTech activities on the behavior of borrowers and lenders.</span>",

        "abstract": "Smart fisheries are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to increase their sustainability. The potential fishing zone (PFZ) forecasts several fish aggregation zones throughout the duration of the prediction in any sea. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and random forest model are used in the current study to provide a technique for locating viable fishing zones in deep marine seas. A significant amount of data was gathered for the database's creation, including monitoring information for Indian fishing fleets from 2017 to 2019. Using expert label datasets for validation, it was discovered that the model's detection accuracy was 98%. Our method uses salinity and dissolved oxygen, two crucial markers of water quality, to identify suitable fishing zones for the first time. In the current research, a system was created to identify and map the quantity of fishing activity. The tests use a number of parameter measurements to evaluate the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) approach to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies. The findings showed that the CECT had a 94% accuracy rate compared to a convolutional neural network's 92% accuracy rate for the 80% training data and 20% testing data.",

        "abstract": "Starting with the global pandemic crisis, whose consequences included the disruption of logistics chains and the suspension in a number of economic sectors, the world economy is experiencing increasingly large losses. Full-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions against the Russian Federation by many countries have made the global economy even more unstable and problematic. Macroeconomic problems are accumulating in the world, which will be a long term trend. The article deals with Ukraine’s domestic financial and monetary sphere since the beginning of Russian aggression in 2014 and in the context of the post-pandemic global crisis. In the first months of the war, Ukraine – being a small open commodity based economy –managed to maintain the stability of money circulation and prevented panic in the financial markets, in contrast to 1998, 2008 and 2014. The full-scale war continued the economic crisis initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The interaction of the two crises deepens imbalances in both the global and Ukrainian economic and financial systems. As manifestations of the crisis, the article examines the disrupted supply chains of goods and raw materials, and the negative impact on the companies' solvency due to reduced demand. On the other hand, with their financial injections, the governments prevent the rapid bankruptcy of unviable firms in order to preserve employment, which exposes the economy to new risks. The article outlines expected developments in Ukraine’s financial system due to long war and the ensuing macroeconomic losses and uncertainty. Recommendations are given on urgent measures to support the banking sector in order to increase its liquidity and solvency under the conditions shaped in 2022. The authors note that in the fight against inflation, it is necessary to take into account the increased energy prices, the disrupted logistics chains for commodity producers, the decreased export revenue, and the increased prices for critical imported goods. Anti-inflationary measures under such conditions could lead to stagnation and phase out domestic production.",

        "abstract": "Given the prevalence of the digital world, artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as one of the most prominent technologies for demand prediction. Although numerous studies have explored energy demand forecasting using machine learning models, previous research has been limited to incorporating either a country’s macroeconomic characteristics or exogenous elements as input variables. The simultaneous consideration of both endogenous and exogenous economic elements in demand forecasting has been disregarded. Furthermore, the stability of machine learning models for energy exporters and importers facing varying uncertainties has not been adequately examined. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps by investigating these issues comprehensively. To accomplish this objective, data from 30 countries spanning the period from 2000 to 2020 was selected. In predicting oil demand, endogenous economic variables, such as carbon emissions, income level, energy price, gross domestic product (GDP), population growth, urbanization, trade liberalization, inflation, foreign direct investment (FDI), and financial development, were considered alongside exogenous factors, including energy sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that among the input variables examined in demand forecasting, oil sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic have had the most significant impact on reducing oil demand, while trade liberalization has proven to be the most influential factor in increasing oil demand. Furthermore, the support vector regression (SVR) model outperforms other models in terms of lower prediction error, as revealed by the error assessment of statistical models and AI in forecasting oil demand. Additionally, when comparing the stability of models in oil exporting and importing countries facing different levels of demand uncertainty, the SVR model demonstrates higher stability compared to other models.",

The article assesses the security of the components of Ukraine’s financial sector and calculates the overall level of financial security in this country. The author considers the current mechanism for determining the level of financial security. To date, in Ukraine, the Methodology for determining the level of financial security is in force, which is approved by the Ministry of Economy based on the \"Methodological recommendations for calculating the level of economic security of Ukraine\" created according to a quantitative study of indicators characterizing the level of Ukraine’s overall economic security and that of financial security as its priority component. Calculated security levels of the financial sectors, namely those of the banking sector and the non-banking financial sector, as well as debt, budget, currency and monetary security. The most problematic is the debt sector whose security level averages 16.9% for the analyzed period. The overall level of financial security has a downward trend (44% in 2021). Ukraine's economy is not protected from financial threats and imbalances. The author identifies a few shortcomings in the above mentioned Methodology. As it was developed in 2013, its indicators no longer reflect the real situatioin in the country, while its methods mainly focus on analyzing financial indicators and ignore non-financial information, external factors, and the impact excerted on     overall financial security by its individual components. The article points to the need to improve the mechanism of assessing the level of national financial security and provides a series of corresponding proposals.",

Machine Learning (ML), as the most advanced branch of AI in the past few years, has shown encouraging results and applications in the edge environment. Nevertheless, edge-powered ML solutions are more complex to realize due to the joint constraints from both edge computing and AI domains, and the corresponding solutions are expected to be efficient and adapted in technologies such as data processing, model compression, distributed inference, and advanced learning paradigms for Edge ML requirements. Despite the fact that a great deal of the attention garnered by Edge ML is gained in both the academic and industrial communities, we noticed the lack of a complete survey on existing Edge ML technologies to provide a common understanding of this concept. To tackle this, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive taxonomy and a systematic review of Edge ML techniques, focusing on the soft computing aspects of existing paradigms and techniques. We start by identifying the Edge ML requirements driven by the joint constraints. We then extensively survey more than twenty paradigms and techniques along with their representative work, covering two main parts: edge inference, and edge learning. In particular, we analyze how each technique fits into Edge ML by meeting a subset of the identified requirements. We also summarize Edge ML frameworks and open issues to shed light on future directions for Edge ML.",

        "abstract": "It is emphasized that the forecasting of financial and economic performance of enterprises has its own characteristics, due to the fact that income from product sales, gross and net profits, as a rule, are unstable. This is especially true for agricultural organizations and processing enterprises. ATU Gagauzia is located in the epicenter of the zone of risky (unsustainable) agriculture. The methodology for forecasting the financial and economic performance of enterprises requires clarification and, if possible, the use of uniform approaches available for use in practice, both for educational purposes and in agricultural organizations. A graphical forecasting method is proposed as the simplest and most accessible for practical use. It is based on the use of charts, analysis of their trends and approximation coefficients, reflecting the trend in the development of economic phenomena over the past 5 years or more. if the approximation coefficient is 0.8 or higher, a linear trend can be used for forecasting. If the approximation coefficient is in the range of 0.5 - 0.8, the forecast value of the indicator should be determined as an average value calculated from linear and polynomial trends. With an approximation coefficient below 0.5, the forecast is calculated as the average of linear and polynomial trends based on the use of annual moving averages. The article presents a methodology for calculating the forecast values of income from sales, equity and net profit on the example of a specific enterprise of ATU Gagauzia for 2013-2022.",

The analysis and forecasting of such series has always been of particular interest for both research analysts and practicing investors. However, financial time series have their own features, which do not allow one to choose the only correct and well-functioning forecasting method. Currently, machine-learning algorithms allow one to analyze large amounts of data and test the resulting models. Modern technologies enable testing and applying complex forecasting methods that require volumetric calculations. They make it possible to develop the mathematical basis of forecasting, to combine different approaches into a single method. An example of such a modern approach is the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), which combines the decomposition of a time series into a sum of time series, principal component analysis and recurrent forecasting. The purpose of this work is to analyze the possibility of applying SSA to financial time series. The SSA method was considered in comparison with other common methods for forecasting financial time series: ARIMA, Fourier transform and recurrent neural network. To implement the methods, a software algorithm in the Python language was developed. The method was also tested on the time series of quotes of Russian and American stocks, currencies and cryptocurrencies.",

        "abstract": "In today’s modern world, monthly forecasts of electricity consumption are vital in planning the generation and distribution of energy utilities. However, the properties of these time series are so complex that they are difficult to model directly. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of forecasting monthly electricity consumption by comparing several decomposition techniques followed by various time series models. To this end, first, we decompose the electricity consumption time series into three new subseries: the long-term trend series, the seasonal series, and the stochastic series, using the three different proposed decomposition methods. Second, to forecast each subseries with various popular time series models, all their possible combinations are considered. Finally, the forecast results of each subseries are summed up to obtain the final forecast results. The proposed modeling and forecasting framework is applied to data on Pakistan’s monthly electricity consumption from January 1990 to June 2020. The one-month-ahead out-of-sample forecast results (descriptive, statistical test, and graphical analysis) for the considered data suggest that the proposed methodology gives a highly accurate and efficient gain. It is also shown that the proposed decomposition methods outperform the benchmark ones and increase the performance of final model forecasts. In addition, the final forecasting models produce the lowest mean error, performing significantly better than those reported in the literature. Finally, we believe that the framework proposed for modeling and forecasting can also be used to solve other forecasting problems in the real world that have similar features.",

By utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, this research focuses on monitoring and forecasting three major pollutants such as Ozone (O3), Ammonia (NH3), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). The proposed IoT-based sensor nodes collect the real-time data and give the resultant data as an input to the Naive Bayes (NB) for classification and Auto-Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) for optimization. The optimized model parameters are obtained and then validated by using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Deploying a machine learning algorithm on a Raspberry Pi-3, the proposed system ensures efficient monitoring and forecasting of air pollutants 24/7 through an online open-source dashboard.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThis paper investigates the predictive impact of Financial Stress on hedging between the oil market and the GCC stock and bond markets from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020. The authors also compare the hedging performance of in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.Design/methodology/approachFor the modeling purpose, the authors combine the GARCH-BEKK model with the machine learning approach to predict the transmission of shocks between the financial markets and the oil market. The authors also examine the hedging performance in order to obtain well-diversified portfolios under both Financial Stress cases, using a One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model.FindingsAccording to the results, the in-sample analysis shows that investors can use oil to hedge stock markets under positive Financial Stress. In addition, the authors prove that oil hedging is ineffective in reducing market risks for bond markets. The out-of-sample results demonstrate the ability of hedging effectiveness to minimize portfolio risk during the recent pandemic in both Financial Stress cases. Interestingly, hedgers will have a more efficient hedging performance in the stock and oil market in the case of positive (negative) Financial Stress. The findings seem to be confirmed by the Diebold-Mariano test, suggesting that including the negative (positive) Financial Stress in the hedging strategy displays better out-of-sample performance than the in-sample model.Originality/valueThis study improves the understanding of the whole sample and positive (negative) Financial Stress estimates and forecasts of hedge effectiveness for both the out-of-sample and in-sample estimates. A portfolio strategy based on transmission shock prediction provides diversification benefits.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWind power has emerged as a successful component within power systems. The ability to reliably and accurately forecast wind speed is of great importance in maintaining the security and stability of the power grid. However, the significance of explaining prediction models has often been overlooked by researchers. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel approach to wind speed forecasting that incorporates a significant decomposition method, attention‐based machine learning, and local explanation techniques. The proposed model utilizes grid search variational mode decomposition to decompose the wind speed sequence into different modes while employing gate recurrent unit with an attention mechanism to achieve superior forecasting performance. Experimental evaluations conducted on eight real‐world wind speed datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other popular models across multiple performance criteria. In two specific experiments, the proposed approach achieved a minimal mean absolute percentage error of 2.74% and 1.70%, respectively. Furthermore, local interpretable model‐agnostic explanations (LIME) were employed to assess the influence of factors, highlighting whether they positively or negatively affected the predicted values.",

According to Inc42, the agricultural sector of India is predicted to increase to US$ 24 billion by 2025. With the increase in population, the demand for food also increases, but more than 30% of crops get affected due to crop diseases. Overall, India lost approximately five million hectares of crop area to flash floods, cyclonic storms, floods, cloudbursts, and landslides till 2021. In that case, there is a need to prevent crops from diseases to fulfil demand supply ratio. This paper presents the feature extraction of tomato viral leaf diseases using various image processing techniques. Most of the research uses Convolutional Neural networks to extract the features of these diseases, but these neural networks are not performing much accurately in real scenarios, so there is a need to extract the features using image processing methods. During the study, it is found that these diseases have different colours, shapes and textures and these features can be used with convolution neural networks to bring more accurate results in real scenarios.</span>",

Much research has been performed in this regard, but most of them used manual feature extraction or ensemble convolution neural networks that result in increased execution time during inference. This paper compared three deep learning models and utilized different augmentation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance without ensembling or fusing the models. Experimentations are made without any augmentation, with standard augmentation, and by mixed sample data augmentation techniques. Gradient accumulation and stochastic weighted averaging with mixed precision are used to have a large batch size that helped to reduce training time. The dataset comprised 48 vehicles’ models running on the road of Pakistan. The highest accuracy and F1 score of 97% and 95% using the FMix augmentation technique with EfficientNetV2-S architecture gave the confidence that the proposed solution can be implemented in production. </span>",

We present a Monte Carlo exercise where we examine the finite sample properties of the deep quantile estimator and show that it delivers good finite sample performance. We use the deep quantile estimator to forecast value-at-risk and find significant gains over linear quantile regression alternatives and other models, which are supported by various testing schemes. Further, we consider also an alternative architecture that allows the use of mixed frequency data in neural networks.

Statistical methods have been used for many years and were later complemented by neural network approaches. Currently, hybrid approaches are increasingly presented, aiming to combine both methods’ advantages. These hybrid forecasting methods could lead to more accurate predictions and enhance and improve visual analytics systems for making decisions or for supporting the decision-making process. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature review using the PRISMA methodology and investigated various hybrid forecasting approaches in detail. The exact procedure for searching and filtering and the databases in which we performed the search were documented and supplemented by a PRISMA flow chart. From a total of 1435 results, we included 21 works in this review through various filtering steps and exclusion criteria. We examined these works in detail and collected the quality of the prediction results. We summarized the error values in a table to investigate whether hybrid forecasting approaches deliver better results. We concluded that all investigated hybrid forecasting methods perform better than individual ones. Based on the results of the PRISMA study, the possible applications of hybrid prediction approaches in visual analytics systems for decision making are discussed and illustrated using an exemplary visualization.",
