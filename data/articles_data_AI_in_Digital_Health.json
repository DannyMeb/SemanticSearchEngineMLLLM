        "abstract": "Inherent to the experience of loneliness is a significant change of meaningful relatedness that (usually negatively) affects a person's relationship to self and others. This paper goes beyond a purely subjective-phenomenological description of individual suffering by emphasizing loneliness as a symptomatic expression of distortions of social recognition relations. Where there is loneliness, a recognition relation has changed. Most societies face an increase in loneliness among all groups of their population, and this sheds light on the reproduction conditions of social integration and inclusion. These functions are essential lifeworldly components of social cohesion and wellbeing. This study asks whether “social” AI promotes these societal success goals of social integration of lonely people. The increasing tendency to regard AI Companions (AICs) as reproducers of adequate recognition is critically discussed with this review. My skepticism requires further justification, especially as a large portion of sociopolitical prevention efforts aim to fight an increase of loneliness primarily with digital strategies. I will argue that AICs rather reproduce than sustainably reduce the pathodynamics of loneliness: loneliness gets simply “digitized.”",

        "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning methods in detecting dental caries from radiographic images. Methods A total of 771 bitewing radiographs were divided into two groups: adult (n = 554) and pediatric (n = 217). Two distinct semantic segmentation models were constructed for each group. They were manually labeled by general dentists for semantic segmentation. The inter-examiner reliability of the two examiners was also measured. Finally, the models were trained using transfer learning methodology along with computer science advanced tools, such as ensemble U-Nets with ResNet50, ResNext101, and Vgg19 as the encoders, which were all pretrained on ImageNet weights using a training dataset. Results Intersection over union (IoU) score was used to evaluate the outcomes of the deep learning model. For the adult dataset, the IoU averaged 98%, 23%, 19%, and 51% for zero, primary, moderate, and advanced carious lesions, respectively. For pediatric bitewings, the IoU averaged 97%, 8%, 17%, and 25% for zero, primary, moderate, and advanced caries, respectively. Advanced caries was more accurately detected than primary caries on adults and pediatric bitewings P < 0.05. Conclusions The proposed deep learning models can accurately detect advanced caries in permanent or primary bitewing radiographs. Misclassification mostly occurs between primary and moderate caries. Although the model performed well in correctly classifying the lesions, it can misclassify one as the other or does not accurately capture the depth of the lesion at this early stage. ",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have gained prominence since 2022. Powered by big data, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, they offer the potential to expand capabilities, improve productivity and provide guidance and support in various domains. Human–Artificial Intelligence (HAI) is proposed to help with the integration of human values, empathy and ethical considerations into AI in order to address the limitations of AI chatbots and enhance their effectiveness. Mental health is a critical global concern, with a substantial impact on individuals, communities and economies. Digital mental health solutions, leveraging AI and ML, have emerged to address the challenges of access, stigma and cost in mental health care. Despite their potential, ethical and legal implications surrounding these technologies remain uncertain. This narrative literature review explores the potential of AI chatbots to revolutionize digital mental health while emphasizing the need for ethical, responsible and trustworthy AI algorithms. The review is guided by three key research questions: the impact of AI chatbots on technology integration, the balance between benefits and harms, and the mitigation of bias and prejudice in AI applications. Methodologically, the review involves extensive database and search engine searches, utilizing keywords related to AI chatbots and digital mental health. Peer-reviewed journal articles and media sources were purposively selected to address the research questions, resulting in a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge on this evolving topic. In conclusion, AI chatbots hold promise in transforming digital mental health but must navigate complex ethical and practical challenges. The integration of HAI principles, responsible regulation and scoping reviews are crucial to maximizing their benefits while minimizing potential risks. Collaborative approaches and modern educational solutions may enhance responsible use and mitigate biases in AI applications, ensuring a more inclusive and effective digital mental health landscape.",

        "abstract": "Objective This qualitative study aims to present the aspirations, expectations and critical analysis of the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to transform patient–physician relationship, according to multi-stakeholder insight. Methods This study was conducted from June to December 2021, using an anticipatory ethics approach and sociology of expectations as the theoretical frameworks. It focused mainly on three groups of stakeholders; namely, physicians (n = 12), patients (n = 15) and healthcare managers (n = 11), all of whom are directly related to the adoption of AI in medicine (n = 38). Results In this study, interviews were conducted with 40% of the patients in the sample (15/38), as well as 31% of the physicians (12/38) and 29% of health managers in the sample (11/38). The findings highlight the following: (1) the impact of AI on fundamental aspects of the patient–physician relationship and the underlying importance of a synergistic relationship between the physician and AI; (2) the potential for AI to alleviate workload and reduce administrative burden by saving time and putting the patient at the centre of the caring process and (3) the potential risk to the holistic approach by neglecting humanness in healthcare. Conclusions This multi-stakeholder qualitative study, which focused on the micro-level of healthcare decision-making, sheds new light on the impact of AI on healthcare and the potential transformation of patient–physician relationship. The results of the current study highlight the need to adopt a critical awareness approach to the implementation of AI in healthcare by applying critical thinking and reasoning. It is important not to rely solely upon the recommendations of AI while neglecting clinical reasoning and physicians’ knowledge of best clinical practices. Instead, it is vital that the core values of the existing patient–physician relationship – such as trust and honesty, conveyed through open and sincere communication – are preserved. ",

The possibilities they raise are neither certain nor determinate, but active investments in them (legal, political and material investments) offer perspective on digital technology-driven influences on an international legal imagination. In contributing to visions of the future that are guiding ambitions for digital sovereignty and digital infrastructures, quantum technologies condition digital technology-driven changes to international law and legal imagination in the present. Privileging observation and description, I adapt and utilize a diffractive method with the aim to discern what emerges out of the interference among the several related things assembled for this article, including material technologies and legal institutions.

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots have the potential to substantially increase access to affordable and effective mental health services by supplementing the work of clinicians. Their 24/7 availability and accessibility through a mobile phone allow individuals to obtain help whenever and wherever needed, overcoming financial and logistical barriers. Although psychological AI chatbots have the ability to make significant improvements in providing mental health care services, they do not come without ethical and technical challenges. Some major concerns include providing inadequate or harmful support, exploiting vulnerable populations, and potentially producing discriminatory advice due to algorithmic bias. However, it is not always obvious for users to fully understand the nature of the relationship they have with chatbots. There can be significant misunderstandings about the exact purpose of the chatbot, particularly in terms of care expectations, ability to adapt to the particularities of users and responsiveness in terms of the needs and resources/treatments that can be offered. Hence, it is imperative that users are aware of the limited therapeutic relationship they can enjoy when interacting with mental health chatbots. Ignorance or misunderstanding of such limitations or of the role of psychological AI chatbots may lead to a therapeutic misconception (TM) where the user would underestimate the restrictions of such technologies and overestimate their ability to provide actual therapeutic support and guidance. TM raises major ethical concerns that can exacerbate one's mental health contributing to the global mental health crisis. This paper will explore the various ways in which TM can occur particularly through inaccurate marketing of these chatbots, forming a digital therapeutic alliance with them, receiving harmful advice due to bias in the design and algorithm, and the chatbots inability to foster autonomy with patients.",

        "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to be a solution for improving healthcare, increasing efficiency, and saving time and recourses. A lack of ethical principles for the use of AI in practice has been highlighted by several stakeholders due to the recent attention given to it. Research has shown an urgent need for more knowledge regarding the ethical implications of AI applications in healthcare. However, fundamental ethical principles may not be sufficient to describe ethical concerns associated with implementing AI applications. Objective The aim of this study is twofold, (1) to use the implementation of AI applications to predict patient mortality in emergency departments as a setting to explore healthcare professionals’ perspectives on ethical issues in relation to ethical principles and (2) to develop a model to guide ethical considerations in AI implementation in healthcare based on ethical theory. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants. The abductive approach used to analyze the empirical data consisted of four steps alternating between inductive and deductive analyses. Results Our findings provide an ethical model demonstrating the need to address six ethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, explicability, and professional governance) in relation to ethical theories defined as virtue, deontology, and consequentialism when AI applications are to be implemented in clinical practice. Conclusions Ethical aspects of AI applications are broader than the prima facie principles of medical ethics and the principle of explicability. Ethical aspects thus need to be viewed from a broader perspective to cover different situations that healthcare professionals, in general, and physicians, in particular, may face when using AI applications in clinical practice.

        "abstract": "Introduction This article was undertaken to explore the potential of AI in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in identifying hip fractures using X-ray radiographs. In the study, we trained three distinct deep learning models, and we utilized majority voting to evaluate their outcomes, aiming to yield the most reliable and precise diagnoses of hip fractures from X-ray radiographs. Methods An initial study was conducted of 10,849 AP pelvis X-rays obtained from five hospitals affiliated with Başkent University. Two expert orthopedic surgeons initially labeled 2,291 radiographs as fractures and 8,558 as non-fractures. The algorithm was trained on 6,943 (64%) radiographs, validated on 1,736 (16%) radiographs, and tested on 2,170 (20%) radiographs, ensuring an even distribution of fracture presence, age, and gender. We employed three advanced deep learning architectures, Xception (Model A), EfficientNet (Model B), and NfNet (Model C), with a final decision aggregated through a majority voting technique (Model D). Results For each model, we achieved the following metrics: For Model A: F1 Score 0.895, Accuracy 0.956, Specificity 0.973, Sensitivity 0.893. For Model B: F1 Score 0.900, Accuracy 0.960, Specificity 0.991, Sensitivity 0.845. For Model C: F1 Score 0.919, Accuracy 0.966, Specificity 0.984, Sensitivity 0.899. For Model D: F1 Score 0.929, Accuracy 0.971, Specificity 0.991, Sensitivity 0.897. We concluded that Model D (majority voting) achieved the best results in terms of the F1 score, accuracy, and specificity values. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that the results obtained by aggregating the decisions of multiple models through voting, rather than relying solely on the decision of a single algorithm, are more consistent. The practical application of these algorithms will be difficult due to ethical, legal, and confidentiality issues, despite the theoretical success achieved. Developing successful algorithms and methodologies should not be viewed as the ultimate goal; it is important to understand how these algorithms will be used in real-life situations. In order to achieve more consistent results, feedback from clinical practice will be helpful. ",

Objective This article investigates how the PMHnet algorithm – an AI prognostication tool developed in Denmark to predict the one-year all-cause mortality risk for patients hospitalized with ischemic heart disease – was presented to cardiologists working in the hospital setting, and how they responded to this novel decision-support tool. Methods Empirically, we draw upon ethnographic fieldwork in the Danish-led international research project, PM Heart, which since 2019 has developed the PMHnet algorithm and implemented the software into the electronic health record system in hospitals in Eastern Denmark (the Capital Region and Region Zealand). Results Paying careful attention to the hopes and concerns of cardiologists who will have to embrace and adapt to algorithmic tools in their everyday work of diagnosing and treating patients, we identify three analytical themes meriting attention when AI is implemented in healthcare: 1) the re-negotiation of agency and autonomy in human-algorithm relations, 2) accountability in algorithmic prognostication and 3) the complex relationship between association and causation actualized by predictive algorithms. From these analytical themes, we elicit methodological questions to guide future ethnographic explorations of how AI and advanced algorithms are put to use in the healthcare system, with what implications, and for whom. Conclusion We conclude that local, qualitative investigations of how algorithms are used, embraced and contested in everyday clinical practice are needed in order to understand their implications – good and bad, intended and unintended – for clinicians, patients and healthcare provision.

        "abstract": "BackgroundVarious patient support programs exist to provide successful therapy options for patients. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of actively supporting patients in their long-term treatment. In order to effectively assist patients, it is crucial to understand their current needs by taking a look at the patients' opinions.ObjectiveThis study focuses specifically on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and aims to determine if the current patient engagement offerings from pharmaceutical companies adequately address the needs of CML patients. To achieve this, the study uses content generated by CML patients to assess the patient engagement strategies of selected pharmaceutical companies, explore the relevance of medication, their products, and services, and analyze key concerns from the perspective of the patients.MethodsTo address the research questions, various methodologies were employed. Initially, desk research was conducted to identify relevant pharmaceutical companies and internet forums related to CML. Subsequently, content generated by patients was acquired and AI-driven techniques such as topic modeling and topic evolution analyses were used to examine this user-generated content (UGC) within the identified public forums. This involved analyzing topic models and tracking topic changes over time.ResultsThe desk research revealed that pharmaceutical companies primarily offer information about the disease and available treatment options. The UGC analysis confirmed the significant role played by the industry in supporting CML patients. Key areas of interest for patients include the disease itself, potential treatment methods and associated side effects, dosage of active substances, and the possibility of switching therapies due to treatment failure or resistance. Stem cell transplantation was also discussed.ConclusionsOverall, the pharmaceutical industry adequately addresses the needs of CML patients. However, there is room for improvement in educating patients about treatment options, drugs, and their side effects. Psychological support should not be neglected. Since CML patients frequently engage with clinical trial outcomes, there is potential for increased patient involvement in such trials. Further research in this area is recommended.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe literature on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) in mental health and psychiatry lacks consensus on what “explainability” means. In the more general XAI (eXplainable AI) literature, there has been some convergence on explainability meaning model-agnostic techniques that augment a complex model (with internal mechanics intractable for human understanding) with a simpler model argued to deliver results that humans can comprehend. Given the differing usage and intended meaning of the term “explainability” in AI and ML, we propose instead to approximate model/algorithm explainability by understandability defined as a function of transparency and interpretability. These concepts are easier to articulate, to “ground” in our understanding of how algorithms and models operate and are used more consistently in the literature. We describe the TIFU (Transparency and Interpretability For Understandability) framework and examine how this applies to the landscape of AI/ML in mental health research. We argue that the need for understandablity is heightened in psychiatry because data describing the syndromes, outcomes, disorders and signs/symptoms possess probabilistic relationships to each other—as do the tentative aetiologies and multifactorial social- and psychological-determinants of disorders. If we develop and deploy AI/ML models, ensuring human understandability of the inputs, processes and outputs of these models is essential to develop trustworthy systems fit for deployment.",

Statistical analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro. Indirect effects and their significance were estimated using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) with resampling set to n = 5000.ResultsPerceived net equity was positively associated with low levels of perceived uncertainty regarding a COVID-19 contact-tracing application and intention to adopt it. Low levels of perceived uncertainty were positively associated with intentions to adopt such an application, thereby suggesting that a perceived level of uncertainty mediates the association between perceived net equity and adoption intentions. Anxieties regarding AI technology and COVID-19 risks both moderate the associations among perceived net equity, perceived level of uncertainty, and intentions to adopt the contact-tracing technology.ConclusionsOur findings highlight how the differing sources of emotion influence the associations among rational judgment, perceptions, and decision-making about new contact-tracing technology.

        "abstract": "Disease diagnosis and monitoring using conventional healthcare services is typically expensive and has limited accuracy. Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment. This necessitates advances in applied materials and structures and using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wearable sensors to extract target signals for accurate clinical decision-making and efficient medical care. In this paper, we review two significant aspects of smart wearable sensors. First, we offer an overview of the most recent progress in improving wearable sensor performance for physical, chemical, and biosensors, focusing on materials, structural configurations, and transduction mechanisms. Next, we review the use of AI technology in combination with wearable technology for big data processing, self-learning, power-efficiency, real-time data acquisition and processing, and personalized health for an intelligent sensing platform.

        "abstract": "The transdermal route of drug administration has gained popularity for its convenience and bypassing the first-pass metabolism. Accurate skin permeability prediction is crucial for successful transdermal drug delivery (TDD). In this study, we address this critical need to enhance TDD. A dataset comprising 441 records for 140 molecules with diverse LogKp values was characterized. The descriptor calculation yielded 145 relevant descriptors. Machine learning models, including MLR, RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, LGBM, and ANN, were employed for regression analysis. Notably, LGBM, XGBoost, and gradient boosting models outperformed others, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Key descriptors influencing skin permeability, such as hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and topological polar surface area, were identified and visualized. Cluster analysis applied to the FDA-approved drug dataset (2326 compounds) revealed four distinct clusters with significant differences in molecular characteristics. Predicted LogKp values for these clusters offered insights into the permeability variations among FDA-approved drugs. Furthermore, an investigation into skin permeability patterns across 83 classes of FDA-approved drugs based on the ATC code showcased significant differences, providing valuable information for drug development strategies. The study underscores the importance of accurate skin permeability prediction for TDD, emphasizing the superior performance of nonlinear machine learning models. The identified key descriptors and clusters contribute to a nuanced understanding of permeability characteristics among FDA-approved drugs. These findings offer actionable insights for drug design, formulation, and prioritization of molecules with optimum properties, potentially reducing reliance on costly experimental testing. Future research directions include offering promising applications in pharmaceutical research and formulation within the burgeoning field of computer-aided drug design.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionA proposed Diagnostic AI System for Robot-Assisted Triage (“DAISY”) is under development to support Emergency Department (“ED”) triage following increasing reports of overcrowding and shortage of staff in ED care experienced within National Health Service, England (“NHS”) but also globally. DAISY aims to reduce ED patient wait times and medical practitioner overload. The objective of this study was to explore NHS health practitioners' perspectives and attitudes towards the future use of AI-supported technologies in ED triage.MethodsBetween July and August 2022 a qualitative-exploratory research study was conducted to collect and capture the perceptions and attitudes of nine NHS healthcare practitioners to better understand the challenges and benefits of a DAISY deployment. The study was based on a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. The study involved qualitative data analysis of the interviewees' responses. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim, and notes included into data documents. The transcripts were coded line-by-line, and data were organised into themes and sub-themes. Both inductive and deductive approaches to thematic analysis were used to analyse such data.ResultsBased on a qualitative analysis of coded interviews with the practitioners, responses were categorised into broad main thematic-types, namely: trust; current practice; social, legal, ethical, and cultural concerns; and empathetic practice. Sub-themes were identified for each main theme. Further quantitative analyses explored the vocabulary and sentiments of the participants when talking generally about NHS ED practices compared to discussing DAISY. Limitations include a small sample size and the requirement that research participants imagine a prototype AI-supported system still under development. The expectation is that such a system would work alongside the practitioner. Findings can be generalisable to other healthcare AI-supported systems and to other domains.DiscussionThis study highlights the benefits and challenges for an AI-supported triage healthcare solution. The study shows that most NHS ED practitioners interviewed were positive about such adoption. Benefits cited were a reduction in patient wait times in the ED, assistance in the streamlining of the triage process, support in calling for appropriate diagnostics and for further patient examination, and identification of those very unwell and requiring more immediate and urgent attention. Words used to describe the system were that DAISY is a “good idea”, “help”, helpful, “easier”, “value”, and “accurate”. Our study demonstrates that trust in the system is a significant driver of use and a potential barrier to adoption. Participants emphasised social, legal, ethical, and cultural considerations and barriers to DAISY adoption and the importance of empathy and non-verbal cues in patient interactions. Findings demonstrate how DAISY might support and augment human medical performance in ED care, and provide an understanding of attitudinal barriers and considerations for the development and implementation of future triage AI-supported systems.",

Usability was determined through a subset of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), the full System Usability Scale (SUS), the Net Promoter Score (NPS), and semi-structured interviews. Results We obtained usability survey data from 50 of 54 patients. Median responses to the selected MARS questions and the mean SUS scores indicated above average usability. The NPS from the semi-structured interviews at the end of the study was 24, indicating a favorable score. Conclusions Cancer patients reported above average usability for the DBM app. Qualitative analyses indicated that the app was easy to use and helpful. Future work will emphasize implementing further patient recommendations and evaluating the app's clinical efficacy in multiple settings. ",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a rapid shift of learning and education from traditional means to digital platforms. This paper aims to examine the impact of online learning on digital engagement and digital-related health symptoms among university students one year into the coronavirus pandemic. Methods: Data was collected through a self-administered online questionnaire after ethical approval. The questionnaire was adapted from the previously published Lifestyle Study in Youth Questionnaire. Through the questionnaire, the perception of students toward online learning was probed and recorded. Digital engagement and digital-related health symptoms were compared before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: The majority (97.5%) of respondents preferred face-to-face learning. The time spent on digital devices was 1.8 times higher during COVID-19 than before the COVID-19 lockdown (t-test = -18.86, p<0.0001). The total hours of sleep were reduced during COVID-19 lockdown (0.6 hours lesser) (t-test = -3.92, p<0.0001). The Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test revealed significant changes in digital-related health symptoms (15 out of 17) due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Digital eye strain, dry eye syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and upper quadrant postural and muscle strain emerged (p<0.05). Conclusion: Most university students favoured face-to-face learning compared to online learning. There was a two-fold rise in digital engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown. As a result, it has seemed to translate into reduced sleeping hours. The short-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic on digital-related health symptoms amongst university students was apparent. The long-term effects require further investigations to facilitate fact-based decision-making.",

        "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with Digital Twins (DTs) has emerged as a promising approach to revolutionize healthcare, particularly in terms of diagnosis and management of thoracic disorders. This study proposes a comprehensive framework, named Lung-DT, which leverages IoT sensors and AI algorithms to establish the digital representation of a patient’s respiratory health. Using the YOLOv8 neural network, the Lung-DT system accurately classifies chest X-rays into five distinct categories of lung diseases, including “normal”, “covid”, “lung_opacity”, “pneumonia”, and “tuberculosis”. The performance of the system was evaluated employing a chest X-ray dataset available in the literature, demonstrating average accuracy of 96.8%, precision of 92%, recall of 97%, and F1-score of 94%. The proposed Lung-DT framework offers several advantages over conventional diagnostic methods. Firstly, it enables real-time monitoring of lung health through continuous data acquisition from IoT sensors, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Secondly, the AI-powered classification module provides automated and objective assessments of chest X-rays, reducing dependence on subjective human interpretation. Thirdly, the twin digital representation of the patient’s respiratory health allows for comprehensive analysis and correlation of multiple data streams, providing valuable insights as to personalized treatment plans. The integration of IoT sensors, AI algorithms, and DT technology within the Lung-DT system demonstrates a significant step towards improving thoracic healthcare. By enabling continuous monitoring, automated diagnosis, and comprehensive data analysis, the Lung-DT framework has enormous potential to enhance patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and optimize resource allocation.",

As LLMs advance to achieve near human-level performances on medical question and answering benchmarks, it is probable that Conversational AI will soon be developed for use in healthcare. In this article we discuss the potential and compare the performance of two different approaches to generative pretrained transformers—ChatGPT, the most widely used general conversational LLM, and Foresight, a GPT (generative pretrained transformer) based model focused on modelling patients and disorders. The comparison is conducted on the task of forecasting relevant diagnoses based on clinical vignettes.

Abundant guidance exists on how to achieve transparency for medical AI products, but it is unclear whether publicly available information adequately informs about their risks. To assess this, we retrieved public documentation on the 14 available CE-certified AI-based radiology products of the II b risk category in the EU from vendor websites, scientific publications, and the European EUDAMED database. Using a self-designed survey, we reported on their development, validation, ethical considerations, and deployment caveats, according to trustworthy AI guidelines. We scored each question with either 0, 0.5, or 1, to rate if the required information was “unavailable”, “partially available,” or “fully available.” The transparency of each product was calculated relative to all 55 questions. Transparency scores ranged from 6.4% to 60.9%, with a median of 29.1%. Major transparency gaps included missing documentation on training data, ethical considerations, and limitations for deployment. Ethical aspects like consent, safety monitoring, and GDPR-compliance were rarely documented. Furthermore, deployment caveats for different demographics and medical settings were scarce. In conclusion, public documentation of authorized medical AI products in Europe lacks sufficient public transparency to inform about safety and risks. We call on lawmakers and regulators to establish legally mandated requirements for public and substantive transparency to fulfill the promise of trustworthy AI for health.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, discussions have been increasingly emerging in modern scientific research that, in connection with the development of AI technologies, questions arise about the objectivity, plausibility and reliability of knowledge, as well as whether these technologies will not replace the expert figure as the authority that has so far acted as a guarantor of objectivity and the center of decision-making. Modern historians of science Duston L. and Galison P. in their book on the history of scientific objectivity, they talk about the alternation of \"epistemic virtues\", as one of which objectivity has been established since a certain moment. At the same time, the promotion of one or another virtue regulating the scientific self, i.e. acting as a normative principle for a scientist when choosing one or another way of seeing and one or another scientific practice, depends on making decisions in difficult cases requiring the will and limitation of the self. In this sense, epistemology is combined with ethics: a scientist, guided by certain moral principles, gives preference to one or another way of behavior, choosing, for example, not a more accurate hand-drawn image, but an uncluttered photograph, perhaps fuzzy, but obtained mechanically, which means more objective and free from any admixture of subjectivity. In this regard, the epistemic status of modern AI-based technologies, which increasingly assume the functions of the scientific self, including in terms of influencing final decision-making and obtaining objective knowledge, seems interesting. For example, in the field of medicine, robotic devices already provide significant support, taking over some of the functions, for example, of a first-level doctor to collect and analyze standardized patient data and diagnostics. There is an assumption that AI will take on more and more responsibilities in the near future: data processing, development of new drugs and treatment methods, establishing remote interaction with the patient, etc. But does this mean that the scientific self can be replaced by AI-based algorithms, and another epistemic virtue will replace objectivity, finally breaking the link between ethics and epistemology – this question needs to be investigated.",

However, the integration, translation, and adoption of these technologies into clinical practice are plagued with many challenges and are lagging. Furthermore, explanations of the impediments to clinical translation are largely unknown and have not been systematically studied from the perspective of AI and digital health care startup founders and executives.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the barriers to integrating early-stage technologies in clinical practice and health care systems from the perspectives of digital health and health care AI founders and executives.\n\n\nMethods\nA stakeholder focus group workshop was conducted with a sample of 10 early-stage digital health and health care AI founders and executives. Digital health, health care AI, digital health–focused venture capitalists, and physician executives were represented. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, transcripts were organized, queried, and analyzed for thematic convergence.\n\n\nResults\nWe identified the following four categories of barriers in the integration of early-stage digital health innovations into clinical practice and health care systems: (1) lack of knowledge of health system technology procurement protocols and best practices, (2) demanding regulatory and validation requirements, (3) challenges within the health system technology procurement process, and (4) disadvantages of early-stage digital health companies compared to large technology conglomerates. Recommendations from the study participants were also synthesized to create a road map to mitigate the barriers to integrating early-stage or novel digital health technologies in clinical practice.\n\n\nConclusions\nEarly-stage digital health and health care AI entrepreneurs identified numerous barriers to integrating digital health solutions into clinical practice. Mitigation initiatives should create opportunities for early-stage digital health technology companies and health care providers to interact, develop relationships, and use evidence-based research and best practices during health care technology procurement and evaluation processes.\n",

This article aims to unveil the complexity of this concept, retracing its historical and cultural origin. This genealogical overview allows to understand the reason why an instrumental conception of digital media has prevailed, considering the digital as a mere tool to convey a message, as opposed to a constitutive conception. The constitutive conception places the digital phenomenon in the broader ground of media studies, and it considers digital technologies as an interface between the subject and the world. In this perspective, the media is not added to the experience of the person, but it shapes it from within on a cognitive, expressive and communicative level. The article makes use of two powerful examples to show the shortcomings of an instrumental conception of the digital, and to affirm the value of a constitutive conception for current media studies regarding digital interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nI demonstrate an approach fostering inventive interpretation of short stories in Literary Studies and higher education generally. It involves constructing an ‘assemblage’—at its simplest, an evolving network of unusual connections for creative outcome. The assemblage of this article combines freshly located research literature, directly and indirectly related to a story’s themes, and/or the personality type of protagonists. Importantly, this assemblage also utilizes text analysis software revealing the relatively invisible (e.g. (in)frequent words, parts of speech, and topics) and Large Language Model (LLM) Generative AI to enrich the interpretation. The use of all these elements helps productively exceed initial intuitions about the story, facilitating creativity. I model the approach using Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, The Black Cat, whose protagonist is a homicidal psychopath. Specifically, the assemblage here includes relevant software-based research (a corpus analysis of homicidal psychopathic language), non-software-based research (psychoanalytical literary criticism of The Black Cat using the empirically validated concept of transference), text analysis software (WMatrix and Datayze), and the LLM Generative AI, ‘ChatGPT’ (using the freely available LLM GPT-3.5). One use of this approach is as a pedagogy in Literary Studies employing text analysis software (e.g. on a digital stylistics course). Yet given creative adaptability is a key 21st-century skill, with digital literacy—including the use of Generative AI—an important contemporary competence, and with the short story genre universally known, I highlight too the utility of this approach as a university-wide pedagogy for enhancing creative thinking.",

In this context, the matters of transparency and accountability remain major concerns that are yet to be effectively addressed. The aim of this paper is to identify the zones of non-transparency in the context of digital platforms and provide recommendations for improving transparency issues on digital platforms. First, by surveying the literature and reflecting on the concept of platformization, choosing an AI definition that can be adopted by different stakeholders, and utilizing AI ethics, we will identify zones of non-transparency in the context of digital platforms. Second, after identifying the zones of non-transparency, we go beyond a mere summary of existing literature and provide our perspective on how to address the raised concerns. Based on our survey of the literature, we find that three major zones of non-transparency exist in digital platforms. These include a lack of transparency with regard to who contributes to platforms; lack of transparency with regard to who is working behind platforms, the contributions of those workers, and the working conditions of digital workers; and lack of transparency with regard to how algorithms are developed and governed. Considering the abundance of high-level principles in the literature that cannot be easily operationalized, this is an attempt to bridge the gap between principles and operationalization.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionLike its counterpart to the south, Canada ranks among the top five countries with the highest rates of opioid prescriptions. With many suffering from opioid use disorder first having encountered opioids via prescription routes, practitioners and health systems have an enduring need to identify and effectively respond to the problematic use of opioid prescription. There are strong challenges to successfully addressing this need: importantly, the patterns of prescription fulfillment that signal opioid abuse can be subtle and difficult to recognize, and overzealous enforcement can deprive those with legitimate pain management needs the appropriate care. Moreover, injudicious responses risk shifting those suffering from early-stage abuse of prescribed opioids to illicitly sourced street alternatives, whose varying dosage, availability, and the risk of adulteration can pose grave health risks.MethodsThis study employs a dynamic modeling and simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of prescription regimes employing machine learning monitoring programs to identify the patients who are at risk of opioid abuse while being treated with prescribed opioids. To this end, an agent-based model was developed and implemented to examine the effect of reduced prescribing and prescription drug monitoring programs on overdose and escalation to street opioids among patients, and on the legitimacy of fulfillments of opioid prescriptions over a 5-year time horizon. A study released by the Canadian Institute for Health Information was used to estimate the parameter values and assist in the validation of the existing agent-based model.Results and discussionThe model estimates that lowering the prescription doses exerted the most favorable impact on the outcomes of interest over 5 years with a minimum burden on patients with a legitimate need for pharmaceutical opioids. The accurate conclusion about the impact of public health interventions requires a comprehensive set of outcomes to test their multi-dimensional effects, as utilized in this research. Finally, combining machine learning and agent-based modeling can provide significant advantages, particularly when using the latter to gain insights into the long-term effects and dynamic circumstances of the former.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) medical devices is rapidly growing. Although AI may benefit the quality and safety of healthcare for older adults, it simultaneously introduces new ethical and legal issues. Many AI medical devices exhibit age-related biases. The first part of this paper explains how ‘digital ageism’ is produced throughout the entire lifecycle of medical AI and may lead to health inequity for older people: systemic, avoidable differences in the health status of different population groups. This paper takes digital ageism as a use case to show the potential inequitable effects of AI, conceptualized as the ‘AI cycle of health inequity’. The second part of this paper explores how the European Union (EU) regulatory framework addresses the issue of digital ageism. It argues that the negative effects of age-related bias in AI medical devices are insufficiently recognized within the regulatory framework of the EU Medical Devices Regulation and the new AI Act. It concludes that while the EU framework does address some of the key issues related to technical biases in AI medical devices by stipulating rules for performance and data quality, it does not account for contextual biases, therefore neglecting part of the AI cycle of health inequity.",

        "abstract": "AbstractToday, open source intelligence (OSINT), i.e., information derived from publicly available sources, makes up between 80 and 90 percent of all intelligence activities carried out by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and intelligence services in the West. Developments in data mining, machine learning, visual forensics and, most importantly, the growing computing power available for commercial use, have enabled OSINT practitioners to speed up, and sometimes even automate, intelligence collection and analysis, obtaining more accurate results more quickly. As the infosphere expands to accommodate ever-increasing online presence, so does the pool of actionable OSINT. These developments raise important concerns in terms of governance, ethical, legal, and social implications (GELSI). New and crucial oversight concerns emerge alongside standard privacy concerns, as some of the more advanced data analysis tools require little to no supervision. This article offers a systematic review of the relevant literature. It analyzes 571 publications to assess the current state of the literature on the use of AI-powered OSINT (and the development of OSINT software) as it relates to the GELSI framework, highlighting potential gaps and suggesting new research directions.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nDigital diabetes prevention programs (dDPPs) are effective “digital prescriptions” but have high attrition rates and program noncompletion. To address this, we developed a personalized automatic messaging system (PAMS) that leverages SMS text messaging and data integration into clinical workflows to increase dDPP engagement via enhanced patient-provider communication. Preliminary data showed positive results. However, further investigation is needed to determine how to optimize the tailoring of support technology such as PAMS based on a user’s preferences to boost their dDPP engagement.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study evaluates leveraging machine learning (ML) to develop digital engagement phenotypes of dDPP users and assess ML’s accuracy in predicting engagement with dDPP activities. This research will be used in a PAMS optimization process to improve PAMS personalization by incorporating engagement prediction and digital phenotyping. This study aims (1) to prove the feasibility of using dDPP user-collected data to build an ML model that predicts engagement and contributes to identifying digital engagement phenotypes, (2) to describe methods for developing ML models with dDPP data sets and present preliminary results, and (3) to present preliminary data on user profiling based on ML model outputs.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the gradient-boosted forest model, we predicted engagement in 4 dDPP individual activities (physical activity, lessons, social activity, and weigh-ins) and general activity (engagement in any activity) based on previous short- and long-term activity in the app. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the area under the precision-recall curve, and the Brier score metrics determined the performance of the model. Shapley values reflected the feature importance of the models and determined what variables informed user profiling through latent profile analysis.\n\n\nResults\nWe developed 2 models using weekly and daily DPP data sets (328,821 and 704,242 records, respectively), which yielded predictive accuracies above 90%. Although both models were highly accurate, the daily model better fitted our research plan because it predicted daily changes in individual activities, which was crucial for creating the “digital phenotypes.” To better understand the variables contributing to the model predictor, we calculated the Shapley values for both models to identify the features with the highest contribution to model fit; engagement with any activity in the dDPP in the last 7 days had the most predictive power. We profiled users with latent profile analysis after 2 weeks of engagement (Bayesian information criterion=−3222.46) with the dDPP and identified 6 profiles of users, including those with high engagement, minimal engagement, and attrition.\n\n\nConclusions\nPreliminary results demonstrate that applying ML methods with predicting power is an acceptable mechanism to tailor and optimize messaging interventions to support patient engagement and adherence to digital prescriptions. The results enable future optimization of our existing messaging platform and expansion of this methodology to other clinical domains.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT04773834; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04773834\n\n\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nRR2-10.2196/26750\n",

        "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the environmental impacts of AI and digital technologies, identify potential mitigation strategies, and assess the role of policy, regulation, and public awareness in fostering sustainable practices within this domain. Employing a qualitative research methodology, this study collected data through semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals across the technology sector, environmental research, policy-making, and academia. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview transcripts, allowing for the identification of main themes and categories related to the environmental impacts of AI and digital technologies and the exploration of potential mitigation strategies. Five main themes emerged from the analysis: Direct Environmental Impact, Mitigation Strategies, Technological Innovations, Policy and Regulation, and Public Awareness and Engagement. Each theme encompasses various categories and concepts, such as Energy Consumption, E-Waste, Renewable Energy Adoption, Sustainable Design, Energy-Efficient Hardware, Legislation and Standards, Educational Campaigns, and Digital Literacy. The findings highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of AI and digital technologies' environmental impacts, along with the crucial role of innovative mitigation strategies and comprehensive policy frameworks in addressing these challenges. The study concludes that while AI and digital technologies offer tremendous potential for advancing sustainable development, their deployment must be carefully managed to minimize negative environmental impacts. It underscores the importance of integrating sustainability considerations into the development and deployment of these technologies, alongside fostering robust policy and regulatory frameworks and enhancing public awareness and engagement to achieve a sustainable digital future.",

        "published": "2023-12",
        "citations": 1,
        "abstract": "AbstractDigital systems are reshaping how we engage with music as a sounding dimension of cultural life that is capable of being transformed into a commodity. At the same time, as we increasingly engage through digital media with each other and with virtual others, attributes of music that underpin our capacity to interact communicatively are disregarded or overlooked within those media. Even before the advent of technologies of music reproduction, music was susceptible to assimilation into economic acts of exchange. What is new in the digital world is the way in which modes of engagement with music are themselves being absorbed into an economy built on the datafication of virtual acts and the digital shadows of casual preferences. But music is more than just sounds that are culturally sanctioned as musical. Music is manifested as behaviours, and in interactive behaviour. Music is participatory as well as presentational, and in the participatory mode—involving collective, non-specialist, interactive real-time music-making—has significant individual and social consequences. Yet music as real-time participation is largely absent from the virtual world, with potential social costs that remain to be understood. Moreover, our everyday, face-to-face communicative—conversational—interactions are imbued with patterns between interlocutors that are musical, in that they share features with what we are happy to describe as “music”. These features are presently lacking in digital systems designed to subserve communicative functions, and this paper will consider the significant implications for our interactions with machines to which their successful incorporation into voice–user interfaces would give rise.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Yet people are often reluctant to trust automated systems, and some patient populations may be particularly distrusting. We sought to determine how diverse patient populations feel about the use of AI diagnostic tools, and whether framing and informing the choice affects uptake. To construct and pretest our materials, we conducted structured interviews with a diverse set of actual patients. We then conducted a pre-registered (osf.io/9y26x), randomized, blinded survey experiment in factorial design. A survey firm provided n = 2675 responses, oversampling minoritized populations. Clinical vignettes were randomly manipulated in eight variables with two levels each: disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea), whether AI is proven more accurate than human specialists, whether the AI clinic is personalized to the patient through listening and/or tailoring, whether the AI clinic avoids racial and/or financial biases, whether the Primary Care Physician (PCP) promises to explain and incorporate the advice, and whether the PCP nudges the patient towards AI as the established, recommended, and easy choice. Our main outcome measure was selection of AI clinic or human physician specialist clinic (binary, “AI uptake”). We found that with weighting representative to the U.S. population, respondents were almost evenly split (52.9% chose human doctor and 47.1% chose AI clinic). In unweighted experimental contrasts of respondents who met pre-registered criteria for engagement, a PCP’s explanation that AI has proven superior accuracy increased uptake (OR = 1.48, CI 1.24–1.77, p < .001), as did a PCP’s nudge towards AI as the established choice (OR = 1.25, CI: 1.05–1.50, p = .013), as did reassurance that the AI clinic had trained counselors to listen to the patient’s unique perspectives (OR = 1.27, CI: 1.07–1.52, p = .008). Disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea) and other manipulations did not affect AI uptake significantly. Compared to White respondents, Black respondents selected AI less often (OR = .73, CI: .55-.96, p = .023) and Native Americans selected it more often (OR: 1.37, CI: 1.01–1.87, p = .041). Older respondents were less likely to choose AI (OR: .99, CI: .987-.999, p = .03), as were those who identified as politically conservative (OR: .65, CI: .52-.81, p < .001) or viewed religion as important (OR: .64, CI: .52-.77, p < .001). For each unit increase in education, the odds are 1.10 greater for selecting an AI provider (OR: 1.10, CI: 1.03–1.18, p = .004). While many patients appear resistant to the use of AI, accuracy information, nudges and a listening patient experience may help increase acceptance. To ensure that the benefits of AI are secured in clinical practice, future research on best methods of physician incorporation and patient decision making is required.",

An underappreciated aspect of this clinical translation is where the AI fits into the clinical workflow, and in turn, the outputs generated by the AI to facilitate clinician interaction in this workflow. For instance, in the canonical use case of AI for medical image interpretation, the AI could prioritize cases before clinician review or even autonomously interpret the images without clinician review. A related aspect is explainability – does the AI generate outputs to help explain its predictions to clinicians? While many clinical AI workflows and explainability techniques have been proposed, a summative assessment of the current scope in clinical practice is lacking. Here, we evaluate the current state of FDA-cleared AI devices for medical image interpretation assistance in terms of intended clinical use, outputs generated, and types of explainability offered. We create a curated database focused on these aspects of the clinician-AI interface, where we find a high frequency of “triage” devices, notable variability in output characteristics across products, and often limited explainability of AI predictions. Altogether, we aim to increase transparency of the current landscape of the clinician-AI interface and highlight the need to rigorously assess which strategies ultimately lead to the best clinical outcomes.",

However, little is known about who the followers of these AI-based virtual influencers are and more importantly, what drives the followers to use AI-based virtual influencers. The results from a survey support the notion that compensatory mechanisms and the need to belong play important roles in affecting usage intentions of AI-based virtual influencers. Specifically, the study finds that usage intentions are mediated and moderated by compensatory mechanisms that arise from the perception of AI-based virtual influencers’ functional benefits and existential threats to human identity. Furthermore, the need for belonging moderates the effects of the following status (following versus non-following) on perceived personalization benefits of AI-based virtual influencers and behavioral intentions to use AI-based virtual influencers.

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools have the potential to improve health equity. However, many historically underrepresented communities have not been engaged in AI/ML training, research, and infrastructure development. Therefore, AIM-AHEAD (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity) seeks to increase participation and engagement of researchers and communities through mutually beneficial partnerships. The purpose of this paper is to summarize feedback from listening sessions conducted by the AIM-AHEAD Coordinating Center in February 2022, titled the “AIM-AHEAD Community Building Convention (ACBC).” A total of six listening sessions were held over three days. A total of 977 people registered with AIM-AHEAD to attend ACBC and 557 individuals attended the listening sessions across stakeholder groups. Facilitators led the conversation based on a series of guiding questions, and responses were captured through voice and chat via the Slido platform. A professional third-party provider transcribed the audio. Qualitative analysis included data from transcripts and chat logs. Thematic analysis was then used to identify common and unique themes across all transcripts. Six main themes arose from the sessions. Attendees felt that storytelling would be a powerful tool in communicating the impact of AI/ML in promoting health equity, trust building is vital and can be fostered through existing trusted relationships, and diverse communities should be involved every step of the way. Attendees shared a wealth of information that will guide AIM-AHEAD’s future activities. The sessions highlighted the need for researchers to translate AI/ML concepts into vignettes that are digestible to the larger public, the importance of diversity, and how open-science platforms can be used to encourage multi-disciplinary collaboration. While the sessions confirmed some of the existing barriers in applying AI/ML for health equity, they also offered new insights that were captured in the six themes.",

Although artificial intelligence algorithms are frequently used to analyze medical images, their application to evaluating intraoral structures based on images captured during emergent ETI remains limited. The aim of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence model for segmenting structures in the oral cavity using video laryngoscope (VL) images. Methods From 54 VL videos, clinicians manually labeled images that include motion blur, foggy vision, blood, mucus, and vomitus. Anatomical structures of interest included the tongue, epiglottis, vocal cord, and corniculate cartilage. EfficientNet-B5 with DeepLabv3+, EffecientNet-B5 with U-Net, and Configured Mask R-Convolution Neural Network (CNN) were used; EffecientNet-B5 was pretrained on ImageNet. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to measure the segmentation performance of the model. Accuracy, recall, specificity, and F1 score were used to evaluate the model's performance in targeting the structure from the value of the intersection over union between the ground truth and prediction mask. Results The DSC of tongue, epiglottis, vocal cord, and corniculate cartilage obtained from the EfficientNet-B5 with DeepLabv3+, EfficientNet-B5 with U-Net, and Configured Mask R-CNN model were 0.3351/0.7675/0.766/0.6539, 0.0/0.7581/0.7395/0.6906, and 0.1167/0.7677/0.7207/0.57, respectively. Furthermore, the processing speeds (frames per second) of the three models stood at 3, 24, and 32, respectively. Conclusions The algorithm developed in this study can assist medical providers performing ETI in emergent situations. ",

        "abstract": "Symposium OverviewOverall Abstract:The past decade has seen an explosion in the growth of technologies in mental health. Particularly, the scaled adoption of virtual care catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up new frontiers in how digital tools can be incorporated into psychiatry. No area of mental health care is as ripe for digital innovation as psychogeriatrics. In this session, an international group of clinicians and researchers will demonstrate how digital health in psychogeriatrics represents multiple cutting edges of innovation.Our symposium will include 4 presentations, that represent original research from the USA, Ecuador, Norway, Kosovo and Australia. We will highlight clinical applications of these digital tools and aligned issues such as improved care access in low- and middle-income countries, the ethics of digital data collection and the potential for creating new liabilities.We will focus on four distinct technologies and applications. Dr. Ipsit Vahia will discuss passive environmental sensing supported by signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI) in guiding treatment decision making, especially in dementia care. His presentation will include discussions on how AI can be incorporated into care while also preserving autonomy. Dr. Kreshnik Hoti will discuss the application of AI on voice-based signals to determine changes in pain levels and psychopathology. His presentation will include research conducted in collaboration between teams based in Australia and Kosovo and through a public-private partnership with a digital health startup. Dr. Ana Trueba will focus on digital interventions, specifically virtual reality (VR). She will present data from two studies, one from McLean hospital In the US, and the other from Ecuador that explore how VR can deliver evidence-based non-pharmacologic interventions. Dr. Bettina Husebø will present data from a project she oversees in Norway. Her talk will discuss how care in nursing homes can be improved by incorporating a range of digital approaches into nursing home care paradigms. A particular focus will be on the relationship between pain and behavior symptoms and dementia among nursing home dwelling older adults.Thus, the symposium will address diagnostics, treatment and systems level care and how New technologies are shaping the evolution of psychogeriatrics worldwide.",

        "abstract": "The accuracy and flexibility of artificial intelligence (AI) systems often comes at the cost of a decreased ability to offer an intuitive explanation of their predictions. This hinders trust and discourage adoption of AI in healthcare, exacerbated by concerns over liabilities and risks to patients’ health in case of misdiagnosis. Providing an explanation for a model’s prediction is possible due to recent advances in the field of interpretable machine learning. We considered a data set of hospital admissions linked to records of antibiotic prescriptions and susceptibilities of bacterial isolates. An appropriately trained gradient boosted decision tree algorithm, supplemented by a Shapley explanation model, predicts the likely antimicrobial drug resistance, with the odds of resistance informed by characteristics of the patient, admission data, and historical drug treatments and culture test results. Applying this AI-based system, we found that it substantially reduces the risk of mismatched treatment compared with the observed prescriptions. The Shapley values provide an intuitive association between observations/data and outcomes; the associations identified are broadly consistent with expectations based on prior knowledge from health specialists. The results, and the ability to attribute confidence and explanations, support the wider adoption of AI in healthcare.",

Here we present blood DNA methylation data from 625 infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a 17-center prospective study, and associate them with disease severity. We investigate differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) for disease severity. We characterize the DMCs based on their association with cell and tissues types, biological pathways, and gene expression. Lastly, we also examine the relationships of severity-related DMCs with respiratory and immune traits in independent cohorts. We identify 33 DMCs associated with severity. These DMCs are differentially methylated in blood immune cells. These DMCs are also significantly enriched in multiple tissues (e.g., lung) and cells (e.g., small airway epithelial cells), and biological pathways (e.g., interleukin-1-mediated signaling). Additionally, these DMCs are associated with respiratory and immune traits (e.g., asthma, lung function, IgE levels). Our study suggests the role of DNA methylation in bronchiolitis severity.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundHealthcare workers' relationship with industry is not merely an agent mediating between consumer and vendor, but they are also inventors of the interventions they exist to deliver. Driven by the background of the digital health era, scientific research and technological (Sci-tech) innovation in the medical field are becoming more and more closely integrated. However, scholars shed little light on Sci-tech relevance to evaluate the innovation performance of healthcare organizations, a distinctive feature of healthcare organizations' innovation in the digital health era.MethodsAcademic publications and patents are the manifestations of scientific research outputs and technological innovation outcomes, respectively. The study extracted data from publications and patents of 159 hospitals in China to evaluate their innovation performance. A total of 18 indicators were constructed, four of which were based on text similarity match and represented the Sci-tech relevance. We then applied factor analyses, analytical hierarchy process, and logistic regression to construct an evaluation model. We also examined the relationship between hospitals' innovation performance and their geographical locations. Finally, we implemented a mediation analysis to show the influence of digital health on hospital innovation performance.ResultsA total of 16 indicators were involved, four of which represented the Sci-tech including the number of articles matched per patent (NAMP), the number of patents matched per article (NPMA), the proportion of highly matched patents (HMP), and the proportion of highly matched articles (HMA). Indicators of HMP (r = 0.52, P = 2.40 × 10−12), NAMP (r = 0.52, P = 2.54 × 10−12), and NPMA (r = 0.51, P = 5.53 × 10−12) showed a strong positive correlation with hospital innovation performance score. The evaluation model in this study was different from other Chinese existing hospital ranking systems. The regional innovation performance index (RIP) of healthcare organizations is highly correlated with per capita disposable income (r = 0.58) and regional GDP (r = 0.60). There was a positive correlation between digital health innovation performance scores and overall hospital innovation performance scores (r = 0.20). In addition, the hospitals' digital health innovation performance affected the hospital's overall innovation score with the mediation of Sci-tech relevance indicators (NPMA and HMA). The hospitals' digital health innovation performance score showed a significant correlation with the number of healthcare workers (r = 0.44).ConclusionThis study constructed an assessment model with four invented indicators focusing on Sci-tech relevance to provide a novel tool for researchers to evaluate the innovation performance of healthcare organizations in the digital health era. The regions with high RIP were concentrated on the eastern coastal areas with a higher level of economic development. Therefore, the promotion of scientific and technological innovation policies could be carried out in advance in areas with better economic development. The innovations in the digital health field by healthcare workers enhance the Sci-tech relevance in hospitals and boost their innovation performance. The development of digital health in hospitals depends on the input of medical personnel.",

Welded aluminum stiffened structures are very common in these vehicles, but even with much research, performance of these structures under fatigue is not completely known. Many experimental investigations on similar structures were performed over the past two decades. Meanwhile, the desire for a comprehensive naval structural health monitoring (SHM) system is receiving greater interest. Recently, with re-advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for structural digital twin, older experimental sensor dataset from crack growth in welded aluminum structure could be better utilized and exploited for crack predictions with few interventions from the sensor data. In this study, piezoelectric wafer active sensors are utilized for SHM of a welded aluminum structure and sensor data were collected at multiple frequencies from multiple specimens. Crack initiation to growth pattern were also recorded. Through machine learning, sensor data from four specimens were exploited to develop an AI algorithm for predicting the crack growth. It is shown that ML and AI frameworks are suitable for ship structure digital twin applications.",

        "abstract": "Explainable AI is deemed essential for clinical applications as it allows rationalizing model predictions, helping to build trust between clinicians and automated decision support tools. We developed an inherently explainable AI model for the classification of acute myeloid leukemia subtypes from blood smears and found that high-attention cells identified by the model coincide with those labeled as diagnostically relevant by human experts. Based on over 80,000 single white blood cell images from digitized blood smears of 129 patients diagnosed with one of four WHO-defined genetic AML subtypes and 60 healthy controls, we trained SCEMILA, a single-cell based explainable multiple instance learning algorithm. SCEMILA could perfectly discriminate between AML patients and healthy controls and detected the APL subtype with an F1 score of 0.86±0.05 (mean±s.d., 5-fold cross-validation). Analyzing a novel multi-attention module, we confirmed that our algorithm focused with high concordance on the same AML-specific cells as human experts do. Applied to classify single cells, it is able to highlight subtype specific cells and deconvolve the composition of a patient’s blood smear without the need of single-cell annotation of the training data. Our large AML genetic subtype dataset is publicly available, and an interactive online tool facilitates the exploration of data and predictions. SCEMILA enables a comparison of algorithmic and expert decision criteria and can present a detailed analysis of individual patient data, paving the way to deploy AI in the routine diagnostics for identifying hematopoietic neoplasms.",

Methods Using an online survey, data are collected from over 4000 Danish citizens. The data are analysed using linear regression models. Results The results show how users’ perceptions of digital health differ significantly. Users are highly interested in data sharing across different healthcare stakeholders but less interested in online health communities. The results also show that the support for digital health is correlated with various health risks, including age, smoking and social network. However, health risks do not have uniform relationship with the perceived value of digital health. Conclusions While developing and implementing new digital health solutions, it is important to consider the perceptions of people who are expected to benefit from such solutions. This study contributes to the literature by deepening the knowledge of how citizens with different risk profiles perceive the multitude of digital health tools being introduced in the healthcare sector.

        "abstract": "AbstractIn various official documents, the European Union has declared its goal to pursue a citizen-centric governance of digital transformation. Through a critical review of several of these documents, here we show how “citizen-centric” is more a glamouring than a driving concept. De facto, the EU is enabling a federated data system that is corporate-driven, economic-oriented, and GDPR-compliant; in other words, a Digital Single Market (DSM). This leaves out societal and collective-level dimensions of digital transformation—such as social inclusion, digital sovereignty, and environmental sustainability—which are acknowledged, but not operationalized, by the EU as pillars of a citizen-centric governance. Hence, the door is open to a complementary approach to the governance of digital transformation. We argue that, while a federated data model can constitute the tech-legal backbone of the emerging DSM, a commoning of data, as an ecosystemic approach that maintains a societal and collective outlook by default, can represent a complement to enact a truly citizen-centric governance.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis exhibits a spectrum of clinical presentations dependent upon the parasites’ persistence and host immunopathologic responses. Although cytolytic CD8 T cells cannot control the parasites, they significantly contribute to pathologic responses. In a murine model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, we previously found that NKG2D plays a role in the ability of cytolytic CD8 T cells to promote disease in leishmanial lesions. Here, we investigated whether NKG2D plays a role in human disease. We found that NKG2D and its ligands were expressed within lesions from L. braziliensis-infected patients and that IL-15 and IL-1β were factors driving NKG2D and NKG2D ligand expression, respectively. Blocking NKG2D reduced degranulation by CD8 T cells in a subset of patients. Additionally, our transcriptional analysis of patients’ lesions found that patients who failed the first round of treatment exhibited higher expression of KLRK1, the gene coding for NKG2D, than those who responded to treatment. These findings suggest that NKG2D may be a promising therapeutic target for ameliorating disease severity in cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis infection.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe digital divide remains an ongoing societal concern, with digital exclusion shown to have a significantly detrimental impact on people’s quality of life. Artificial intelligence (AI), the latest wave of digitalisation, is being integrated into the fabric of society at an accelerated rate, the speed of which has prompted ethical concerns. Without addressing the digital divide, the AI revolution risks exacerbating the existing consequences of digital exclusion and limiting the potential for all people to reap the benefits provided by AI. To understand the factors that might contribute to experiences of AI, and how these might be related to digital exclusion, we surveyed a diverse online community sample (N = 303). We created a novel measure of digital confidence capturing individual levels of awareness, familiarity, and sense of competence with digital technology. Results indicated that measures of digital confidence were predicted by structural, behavioural, and psychological differences, such that women, older people, those on lower salaries, people with less digital access, and those with lower digital well-being, reported significantly less digital confidence. Furthermore, digital confidence significantly moderated the relationship between people’s experiences with everyday AI technologies and their general attitudes towards AI. This understanding of the spill-over effects of digital exclusion onto experiences of AI is fundamental to the articulation and delivery of inclusive AI.",

        "abstract": "The recent emergence of OpenAI and ChatGPT has brought numerous advantages for the professions of accountants and auditors, but at the same time numerous risks, threats and challenges. GPT's ability to understand, predict and generate human-like text has turned the technology into a clear foundation that redefines and shapes a wide range of activities, including internal auditing. GPT models have rapidly evolved from their initial roles in simple text generation to complex applications. Their ability to understand language and context, generate coherent and relevant text, and learn from vast amounts of data makes them ideal for tasks such as compiling internal audit reports. Internal audit reports summarize key findings and identify risks that need to be remedied for the audit committee, CEOs and senior management. However, writing and presenting such reports takes a lot of time, and using GPT can help significantly with that. The subject of the paper is a comprehensive review of a wide range of AI, internal audit, reporting transformation. The main conclusion points to the growing responsibility of internal auditors with the widespread use of generative artificial intelligence services to support audit reporting. Internal auditors must be aware of the risks and challenges brought by the new technology, based on artificial intelligence, which requires clear training and thematic areas incorporated into the curricula in the process of certification of internal auditors.",

However, bribery, lack of financial accountability and counterfeit drugs, a shortage of human resources, poor hygiene and ineffective infection control measures, and poor medical record keeping have been identified as major challenges for the implementation of a successful public healthcare system. Fraudulent orders, tender irregularities, fiscal dumping, and over-pricing have also been identified as additional challenges. Due to the lack of quality healthcare services, people have lost trust and hope in the African National Congress (ANC).

        "abstract": "Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce disparities, improve quality of care, and reduce cost by improving access to specialty diagnoses at the point-of-care. Diabetes and related complications represent a significant source of health disparities. Vision loss is a complication of diabetes, and there is extensive evidence supporting annual eye exams for prevention. Prior to the use of autonomous AI, store-and-forward imaging approaches using remote reading centers (asynchronous telemedicine) attempted to increase diabetes related eye exams with limited success. In 2018, after rigorous clinical validation, the first fully autonomous AI system [LumineticsCore™ (formerly IDx-DR), Digital Diagnostics Inc., Coralville, IA, United States] received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) De Novo authorization. The system diagnoses diabetic retinopathy (including macular edema) without specialist physician overread at the point-of-care. In addition to regulatory clearance, reimbursement, and quality measure updates, successful adoption requires local optimization of the clinical workflow. The general challenges of frontline care clinical workflow have been well documented in the literature. Because healthcare AI is so new, there remains a gap in the literature about challenges and opportunities to embed diagnostic AI into the clinical workflow. The goal of this review is to identify common workflow themes leading to successful adoption, measured as attainment number of exams per month using the autonomous AI system against targets set for each health center. We characterized the workflow in four different US health centers over a 12-month period. Health centers were geographically dispersed across the Midwest, Southwest, Northeast, and West Coast and varied distinctly in terms of size, staffing, resources, financing and demographics of patient populations. After 1 year, the aggregated number of diabetes-related exams per month increased from 89 after the first month of initial deployment to 174 across all sites. Across the diverse practice types, three primary determinants underscored sustainable adoption: (1) Inclusion of Executive and Clinical Champions; (2) Underlining Health Center Resources; and (3) Clinical workflows that contemplate patient identification (pre-visit), LumineticsCore Exam Capture and Provider Consult (patient visit), and Timely Referral Triage (post-visit). In addition to regulatory clearance, reimbursement and quality measures, our review shows that addressing the core determinants for workflow optimization is an essential part of large-scale adoption of innovation. These best practices can be generalizable to other autonomous AI systems in front-line care settings, thereby increasing patient access, improving quality of care, and addressing health disparities.",

Accurate device identification in the increasingly complex network structures is necessary. In this paper, a device fingerprinting (DFP) method has been proposed for device identification, based on digital footprints, which devices use for communication over a network. A subset of nine features have been selected from the network and transport layers of a single transmission control protocol/internet protocol packet based on attribute evaluators in Weka, to generate device-specific signatures. The method has been evaluated on two online datasets, and an experimental dataset, using different supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. Results have shown that the method is able to distinguish device type with up to 100% precision using the random forest (RF) classifier, and classify individual devices with up to 95.7% precision. These results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed DFP method for device identification, in order to provide a more secure and robust network.</span>",

        "abstract": " Digital transformation in health care has a lot of opportunities to improve access and quality of care. However, in reality not all individuals and communities are benefiting equally from these innovations. People in vulnerable conditions, already in need of more care and support, are often not participating in digital health programs. Fortunately, numerous initiatives worldwide are committed to make digital health accessible to all citizens, stimulating the long-cherished global pursuit of universal health coverage. Unfortunately initiatives are not always familiar with each other and miss connection to jointly make a significant positive impact. To reach universal health coverage via digital health it is necessary to facilitate mutual knowledge exchange, both globally and locally, to link initiatives and apply academic knowledge into practice. This will support policymakers, health care providers and other stakeholders to ensure that digital innovations can increase access to care for everyone, leading towards Digital health for all. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe term “ethicswashing” was recently coined to describe the phenomenon of instrumentalising ethics by misleading communication, creating the impression of ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), while no substantive ethical theory, argument, or application is in place or ethicists involved. Ethicswashing resembles greenwashing for environmental issues and has become an issue – particularly since 2019 with Thomas Metzinger’s harsh criticisms as a member of the EU panel for developing ethical guidelines for AI, which he called “ethicswashing.” Nowadays, increased ethics washing has changed the perception of AI ethics, leading critics to find a “trivialization” of ethics that may even lead to “ethics bashing.” Considering the scattered literature body and the various manifestations of digital ethicswashing, we recognise the need to assess the existing literature comprehensively. To fill this gap, this research systematically reviews current knowledge about digital ethicswashing stemming from various academic disciplines, contributing to an up-to-date assessment of its underlying characteristics. Applying content analysis to map the field leads us to present five thematic clusters: ethicswashing, ethics bashing, policymaking and regulation, watchdogs, and academia. In conclusion, we synthesise ethicswashing along a process-perception-outcome framework to provide future research to explore the multiple meanings of digital ethicswashing.",

While these proposed Directives provide some uniform liability rules for AI-caused harm, they fail to fully accomplish the EU’s goal of providing clarity and uniformity for liability for injuries caused by AI-driven goods and services. Instead, the Directives leave potential liability gaps for injuries caused by some black-box medical AI systems, which use opaque and complex reasoning to provide medical decisions and/or recommendations. Patients may not be able to successfully sue manufacturers or healthcare providers for some injuries caused by these black-box medical AI systems under either EU Member States’ strict or fault-based liability laws. Since the proposed Directives fail to address these potential liability gaps, manufacturers and healthcare providers may have difficulty predicting liability risks associated with creating and/or using some potentially beneficial black-box medical AI systems.",

This perspectives article explores the multifaceted opportunities and challenges in leveraging these technologies for value-based, precision sarcoma care. We delineate the current state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies in sarcoma care and outline their practical implications for healthcare providers, administrators, and policymakers. The article also addresses the limitations of AI and digital health platforms, emphasizing the need for high-quality data and ethical considerations. We delineate the promise held by the synergy of digital health platforms and AI algorithms in enhancing data-driven decision-making, outcome analytics, and personalized treatment planning. The concept of a sarcoma digital twin serves as an illustrative paradigm for this integration, offering a comprehensive, patient-centric view of the healthcare journey. The paper concludes with proposals for future research aimed at advancing the field, including the need for randomized controlled trials or target trial emulations and studies focusing on ethical and economic aspects. While the road to this transformative care is laden with ethical, regulatory, and practical challenges, we believe that the potential benefits far outweigh the obstacles. We conclude with a call to action for multidisciplinary collaboration and systemic adoption of these technologies, underscoring the urgency to act now for the future betterment of sarcoma care and healthcare at large.",

        "abstract": "AbstractConversational artificial intelligence (AI), particularly AI-based conversational agents (CAs), is gaining traction in mental health care. Despite their growing usage, there is a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of their impact on mental health and well-being. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to fill this gap by synthesizing evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based CAs in improving mental health and factors influencing their effectiveness and user experience. Twelve databases were searched for experimental studies of AI-based CAs’ effects on mental illnesses and psychological well-being published before May 26, 2023. Out of 7834 records, 35 eligible studies were identified for systematic review, out of which 15 randomized controlled trials were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that AI-based CAs significantly reduce symptoms of depression (Hedge’s g 0.64 [95% CI 0.17–1.12]) and distress (Hedge’s g 0.7 [95% CI 0.18–1.22]). These effects were more pronounced in CAs that are multimodal, generative AI-based, integrated with mobile/instant messaging apps, and targeting clinical/subclinical and elderly populations. However, CA-based interventions showed no significant improvement in overall psychological well-being (Hedge’s g 0.32 [95% CI –0.13 to 0.78]). User experience with AI-based CAs was largely shaped by the quality of human-AI therapeutic relationships, content engagement, and effective communication. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based CAs in addressing mental health issues. Future research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of their effectiveness, assess long-term effects across various mental health outcomes, and evaluate the safe integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care.",

        "abstract": "Informal caregivers are a critical source of support for cancer patients. However, their perspectives are not routinely collected, despite health impacts related to the burden of caregiving. We created the TOGETHERCare smartphone application (app) to collect observer-reported outcomes regarding the cancer patient’s health and caregiver’s perceptions of their own mental and physical health, and to provide tips and resources for self-care and patient care. We enrolled 54 caregivers between October 2020 and March 2021 from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated healthcare system. Fifty caregivers used the app for approximately 28 days. Usability and acceptability were assessed using questions from the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), the System Usability Scale (SUS), the Net Promoter Score (NPS), and semi-structured interviews. The caregivers’ mean age was 54.4 years, 38% were female and 36% were non-White. The SUS total mean score was 83.4 (SD = 14.2), for a percentile rank of 90–95 (“excellent”). Median MARS responses to the functionality questions were also high. The NPS score of 30 at the end of the study indicated that most caregivers would recommend the app. Themes from semi-structured interviews were consistent across the study period and indicated that the app was easy to use and helpful. Caregivers indicated a need for feedback from the app, suggested some changes to the wording of questions, the app’s visuals, and timing of notifications. This study demonstrated that caregivers are willing to complete frequent surveys about themselves and their patients. The app is unique because it provides a remote method to collect caregivers’ observations about the patient that may be useful for clinical care. To our knowledge, TOGETHERCare is the first mobile app developed specifically to capture adult cancer patient symptoms from the informal caregiver’s perspective. Future research will examine whether use of this app can help improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "AimsThe use of virtual care enabled by digital technologies has increased, prompted by public health restrictions in response to COVID-19. Non-hospitalized persons in the acute phase of COVID-19 illness may have unique health needs while self-isolating in the community. This scoping review aimed to explore the nature of care, the use of digital technologies, and patient outcomes arising from virtual care among community-based self-isolating COVID-19 patients.MethodsLiterature searches for peer-reviewed articles were conducted in four bibliographic databases: CINAHL, Medline, Embase and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between January and February 2022, followed by hand-searching reference lists of included articles. Two levels of screening using defined eligibility criteria among two independent reviewers were completed.ResultsOf the 773 articles retrieved, 19 were included. Results indicate that virtual care can be safe while enabling timely detection of clinical deterioration to improve the illness trajectory. COVID-19 virtual care was delivered by single health professionals or by multidisciplinary teams using a range of low-technology methods such as telephone to higher technology methods like wearable technology that transmitted physiological data to the care teams for real-time or asynchronous monitoring.ConclusionThe review described the varied nature of virtual care including its design, implementation, and evaluation. Further research is needed for continued exploration on how to leverage digital health assets for the delivery of appropriate and safe virtual COVID-19 community care, which can support patient recovery, control transmission, and prevent intensifying the burden on the health care system, especially during surges.",

        "abstract": "Background Remote digital health studies are on the rise and promise to reduce the operational inefficiencies of in-person research. However, they encounter specific challenges in maintaining participation (enrollment and retention) due to their exclusive reliance on technology across all study phases. Objective The goal of this study was to collect experts’ opinions on how to facilitate participation in remote digital health studies. Method We conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with principal investigators, researchers, and software developers who had recent experiences with remote digital health studies. Informed by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework, we performed a thematic analysis and mapped various approaches to successful study participation. Results Our analyses revealed four themes: (1) study planning to increase participation, where experts suggest that remote digital health studies should be planned based on adequate knowledge of what motivates, engages, and disengages a target population; (2) participant enrollment, highlighting that enrollment strategies should be selected carefully, attached to adequate support, and focused on inclusivity; (3) participant retention, with strategies that minimize the effort and complexity of study tasks and ensure that technology is adapted and responsive to participant needs, and (4) requirements for study planning focused on the development of relevant guidelines to foster participation in future studies. Conclusions Our findings highlight the significant requirements for seamless technology and researcher involvement in enabling high remote digital health study participation. Future studies can benefit from collected experiences and the development of guidelines to inform planning that balances participant and scientific requirements. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractSensemaking has recently been identified as a driver of society developments, in particular in the context of designing a reasonable, valuable, and fair life. Since the construction of meaning is a crucial momentum in sensemaking processes, the authors investigate how meaning can be constructed in a sustaining form by utilizing digital means of expression, articulation, sharing of information, and creation of artscience artefacts. The authors report on results of exploring cyber-physical-systems with performative methodologies in the context of sensemaking to identify sensemaking processes of entering digital environments and share meaning-making activities through interaction. The collected data from two artscience studies reveal that activities beyond cognition facilitate sensemaking. Aesthetics and embodiment in performing actions are understood to play a role in sensemaking and subsequently effect on the construction of meaning. To investigate the role of the body and aesthetics in sensemaking in digital environments, we were particularly interested in sensemaking through embodied agency and aesthetic awareness, drawing from kinesthetic awareness of performance artists. In the performative activities digital behavior recognition and human task behavior were coupled, on the one hand by performers exploring digital environments actively reflecting on their performative process, on the other hand by a performance artist and choreographer creating performative experiences for audiences. It has been demonstrated in cyber-physical settings and can be utilized in upcoming developments further integrating virtual and physical worlds.",

Climate change, resource depletion, and the need for decarbonization demand innovative solutions. This analytical research paper examines the key challenges in the energy sector and explores how generative AI, digital twins, AI, and data science can play a transformative role in addressing these challenges. By leveraging advanced technologies and data-driven approaches, the energy sector can achieve greater efficiency, optimize operations, and facilitate informed decision-making. Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves replicating human-like intelligence in machines, enabling them to execute tasks that typically demand human cognitive capabilities like perception, reasoning, learning, and problem[1]solving. AI encompasses various methodologies and technologies, such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. Its adoption in the energy sector carries significant promise for addressing critical concerns and revolutionizing the industry. An overarching challenge in the energy sector revolves around enhancing energy efficiency, and AI emerges as a pivotal tool for optimizing energy utilization and curbing wastage. By analyzing vast amounts of data from various sources such as sensors, smart meters, and historical energy consumption patterns, AI algorithms can identify patterns and anomalies that humans may not detect. This enables the development of predictive models and algorithms that optimize energy consumption, leading to significant energy savings.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article is about professional skill and what happens when work is instrumented with technology. The purpose is to contribute to the understanding of the professional skill, its role and development in an increasingly digitalized working life. The article also argues that more research is needed to understand what is at stake in terms of professional skill in the age of digital technology. The research on which the article is based shows that people adapt their way of thinking and perceiving reality to the technology they use. This means that people are gradually becoming more and more like machines. There is an ongoing intellectual inner mechanization, which can be contrasted with the outer mechanization of human muscle power that the industrial revolution entailed. The intellectually mechanized man observes and describes reality in the terms of technology and loses the ability to discern nuances and make qualified judgments gradually. The concepts of Turing’s man and functional autism capture these phenomena. Tacit engagement is a concept that captures the tacit knowledge that can only be expressed when people share physical space. The concept draws attention to the importance of the physical space and the body and what is at stake in terms of interpersonal knowledge in the wake of digital communication technology. It is not machines with supposedly human abilities and characteristics that we need to pay attention to when working life becomes increasingly digitalized, but people who gradually become like machines. What is required to safeguard the knowledge that is unique to man is bildung, i.e., to see the limits of the technology and the abstract theoretical models one uses. Art, classical literature, and drama, with their more plastic language, can reach areas where mathematics and natural science cannot reach.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough numerous ethical principles and guidelines have been proposed to guide the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it has proven difficult to translate these principles into actionable practices beyond mere adherence to ethical ideas. This is particularly challenging in the context of AI systems for healthcare, which requires balancing the potential benefits of the solution against the risks to patients and the wider community, including minorities and underserved populations. To address this challenge, we propose a shift from one-size-fits-all ethical principles to contextualized case-based ethical frameworks. This study uses an AI-enabled mHealth application as a case study. Our framework is built on existing ethical guidelines and principles, including the AI4People framework, the EU High-Level Expert Group on trustworthy AI, and wider human rights considerations. Additionally, we incorporate relational perspectives to address human value concerns and moral tensions between individual rights and public health. Our approach is based on ”ethics by design,” where ethical principles are integrated throughout the entire AI development pipeline, ensuring that ethical considerations are not an afterthought but implemented from the beginning. For our case study, we identified 7 ethical principles: fairness, agility, precision, safeguarding humanity, respect for others, trust and accountability, and robustness and reproducibility. We believe that the best way to mitigate and address ethical consequences is by implementing ethical principles in the software development processes that developers commonly use. Finally, we provide examples of how our case-based framework can be applied in practice, using examples of AI-driven mobile applications in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Digital agriculture employs artificial intelligence (AI) to transform data collected in the field into actionable crop management. Effective digital agriculture models can detect problems early, reducing costs significantly. However, ineffective models can be counterproductive. Farmers often want to validate models by spot checking their fields before expending time and effort on recommended actions. However, in large fields, farmers can spot check too few areas, leading them to wrongly believe that ineffective models are effective. Model validation is especially difficult for models that use neural networks, an AI technology that normally assesses crops health accurately but makes inexplicable recommendations. We present a new approach that trains random forests, an AI modeling approach whose recommendations are easier to explain, to mimic neural network models. Then, using the random forest as an explainable white box, we can (1) gain knowledge about the neural network, (2) assess how well a test set represents possible inputs in a given field, (3) determine when and where a farmer should spot check their field for model validation, and (4) find input data that improve the test set. We tested our approach with data used to assess soybean defoliation. Using information from the four processes above, our approach can reduce spot checks by up to 94%.",

Development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for diagnosing of diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema (DME), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), vitreomacular interface abnormalities (VMA) through the analysis of OCT scans and fundus images.      Material and methods. Fundus images of patients with DR and DME, OCT scans of patients with DME, AMD and VMA were used as training and validation databases. The volume of training databases was 3600 fundus images and 10 000 OCT scans, the volume of validation databases was 400 fundus images and 1000 OCT scans. For fundus images analysis algorithms accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUROC were calculated for the following structures: microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates, retinal and optic disc neovascularization, preretinal hemorrhages, epiretinal fibrosis, laser coagulates. For OCT scan analysis algorithms, these metrics were calculated for the features: intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid, pigment epithelium detachment, subretinal hyperreflective material, drusen, epiretinal membrane, full thickness macular hole, lamellar macular hole, vitreomacular traction.      Results. For fundus images analysis algorithms, accuracy exceeded 93% for all features except soft exudates (88.3%) and neovascularization (88.0%), sensitivity exceeded 90% for all features except neovascularization (80.2%) and epiretinal fibrosis (72.5%), specificity exceeded 91% for all features except microaneurysms (80.5%), hard exudates (83.5%) and soft exudates (88.7%), AUROC exceeded 0.90 for all signs except epiretinal fibrosis (0.88), neovascularization (0.87), preretinal hemorrhages (0.89). For OCT analysis algorithms, accuracy exceeded 93% for all features, sensitivity exceeded 90% for all features except lamellar macular hole (87.22%), specificity exceeded 93% for all features, AUROC exceeded 0.93 for all features.      Conclusion. An algorithm for high precision segmentation of pathological signs has been developed. Based on these AI algorithms, the Retina.AI ophthalmological platform was developed, which allows automated analysis of OCT scans and fundus images and diagnosing of DR, DME, AMD and VMA.

        "abstract": "Objective Delay discounting denotes the tendency for humans to favor short-term immediate benefits over long-term future benefits. Episodic future thinking (EFT) is an intervention that addresses this tendency by having a person mentally “pre-experience” a future event to increase the perceived value of future benefits. This study explores the feasibility of using mobile health (mHealth) technology to deliver EFT micro-interventions. Micro-interventions are small, focused interventions aiming to achieve goals while matching users’ often limited willingness or capacity to engage with interventions. We aim to explore whether EFT delivered as digital micro-interventions can reduce delay discounting, the users’ perceptions, and if there are differences between regular EFT and goal-oriented EFT (gEFT), a variant where goals are embedded into future events. Method A randomized study was conducted with 208 participants allocated to either gEFT, EFT, or a control group for a 21-day study. Results Results indicate intervention groups when combined achieved a significant reduction of [Formula: see text] in delay discounting ([Formula: see text]) compared to the control. When split into gEFT and EFT separately only the reduction of [Formula: see text] in EFT delay discounting was significant ([Formula: see text]). We further explore and discuss thematic user perceptions. Conclusions Overall, user perceptions indicate gEFT may be slightly better for use in micro-interventions. However, perceptions also indicate that audio-based EFT micro-interventions were not always preferable to users, with findings suggesting that future EFT micro-interventions should be delivered using different forms of multimedia based on user preference and context and supported by other micro-interventions to maintain interest.

        "abstract": " When patients are unwilling to speak openly, therapists miss valuable information and may not be able to provide best possible care. This study investigated the idea of human Digital Twins (DT) of patients and therapists as a novel solution to encourage them to speak openly. We proposed a methodology to create highly realistic human DT using computer vision, 3D scanning, Metahumans tool, and Unreal game engine. Based on this methodology, we created two versions of virtual therapeutic session: a) video-based virtual sessions with real human and b) virtual sessions with DT of patients and therapists. Twelve therapists then were asked to evaluate technology acceptance of each virtual session. Participants reported significantly lower trust to virtual sessions with highly realistic digital human compared to video-based one. Findings from this study may provide insights regarding opportunities and challenges of virtual therapy using highly realistic digital human technologies. This work also contributes to the virtual therapeutic research field by proposing an AI-powered methodology to create human DT of patients and therapists. Further studies are needed to provide more validation of the efficiency of this approach in virtual sessions for mental health support. ",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the performance of a large language model called ChatGPT on the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), which consists of three exams: Step 1, Step 2CK, and Step 3. ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement. Additionally, ChatGPT demonstrated a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations. These results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, clinical decision-making.",
