        "abstract": "Artistic style transfer, a captivating application of generative artificial intelligence, involves fusing the content of one image with the artistic style of another to create unique visual compositions. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of a novel technique for style transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging deep image representations learned by CNNs, we demonstrate how to separate and manipulate image content and style, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images that combine content and style in a harmonious manner. We describe the methodology, including content and style representations, loss computation, and optimization, and showcase experimental results highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the approach across different styles and content.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, after the study ‘A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style’ published by Gatys et al. in 2016b, research on style transfer boomed drastically. Style transfer is the process of copying an art style from a ‘style image’ to the contents of the ‘content image’ and producing a ‘draft image’ that is on par with respect to quality expectations. This paper explores different techniques of achieving style transformations namely Style Fusion and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Although CNNs are the state-of-the-art architecture to tackle cognitive visual tasks, and that they clearly perform much better than most conventional algorithms, the image processing-based style fusion method comes close to the CNN in terms of image output quality and supersedes in terms of time and computation and resources complexity. The procedure of both of these methods has been discussed in detail in this paper and it was concluded that CNNs have a lot more room for improvement that can be facilitated by the availability of better and larger datasets.",

        "abstract": "This study’s main goal is to create a useful software application for finding and classifying fine art photos in museums and art galleries. There is an increasing need for tools to swiftly analyze and arrange art collections based on their artistic styles as a result of the digitization of art collections. To increase the accuracy of the style categorization, the suggested technique involves two parts. The input image is split into five sub-patches in the first stage. A DCNN that has been particularly trained for this task is then used to classify each patch individually. A decision-making module using a shallow neural network is part of the second phase. Probability vectors acquired from the first-phase classifier are used to train this network. The results from each of the five patches are combined in this phase to deduce the final style classification for the input image. One key advantage of this approach is employing probability vectors rather than images, and the second phase is trained separately from the first. This helps compensate for any potential errors made during the first phase, improving accuracy in the final classification. To evaluate the proposed method, six various already-trained CNN models, namely AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and InceptionV3, were employed as the first-phase classifiers. The second-phase classifier was implemented as a shallow neural network. By using four representative art datasets, experimental trials were conducted using the Australian Native Art dataset, the WikiArt dataset, ILSVRC, and Pandora 18k. The findings showed that the recommended strategy greatly surpassed existing methods in terms of style categorization accuracy and precision. Overall, the study assists in creating efficient software systems for analyzing and categorizing fine art images, making them more accessible to the general public through digital platforms. Using pre-trained models, we were able to attain an accuracy of 90.7. Our model performed better with a higher accuracy of 96.5 as a result of fine-tuning and transfer learning.",

        "abstract": " With the development of computer technology, image stylization has become one of the hottest technologies in image processing. To optimize the effect of artistic image style conversion, a method of artistic image style conversion optimized by attention mechanism is proposed. The CycleGAN network model is introduced, and then the generator is optimized by the attention mechanism. Finally, the application effect of the improved model is tested and analyzed. The results show that the improved model tends to be stable after 40 iterations, the loss value remains at 0.3, and the PSNR value can reach up to 15. From the perspective of the generated image effect, the model has a better visual effect than the CycleGAN model. In the subjective evaluation, 63 people expressed satisfaction with the converted artistic image. As a result, the cyclic generative adversarial network model optimized by the attention mechanism improves the clarity of the generated image, enhances the effect of blurring the target boundary contour, retains the detailed information of the image, optimizes the image stylization effect, and improves the image quality of the method and application value of the processing field.

        "abstract": "Controlling the degree of stylization in the Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a little tricky since it usually needs hand-engineering on hyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose the first deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) based architecture that splits one-step style transfer into a step-wise process for the NST task. Our RL-based method tends to preserve more details and structures of the content image in early steps, and synthesize more style patterns in later steps. It is a user-easily-controlled style-transfer method. Additionally, as our RL-based model performs the stylization progressively, it is lightweight and has lower computational complexity than existing one-step Deep Learning (DL) based models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.",

Previous research in this area has made important breakthroughs, creating various style transfer models and innovative architectural designs, and has achieved success in commercial applications. This paper presents a novel design for automatic style weight determination based on constraining the initial total loss within a healthy range and finding the optimal solution through grid search. This design aims to harness the potential of existing NST models by automating the optimization of neural style transfer hyperparameters. The paper first discusses the impact of content weights and loss weights on the generated images and validates the influence of weight ratios on image quality through experimental adjustments of weight proportions. It also confirms that the initial loss essentially defines the optimization space of the optimizer. The paper explores the significance of the initial loss and proposes a method to improve image generation quality by constraining the initial loss range.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a major cause of death among women in both developed and underdeveloped countries. Early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer are crucial for patients to receive proper treatment and increase their chances of survival. To improve the automatic detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, a new deep learning model called “Breast Cancer Prognosis Based Transfer Learning (BCP-TL)” has been developed. This model uses transfer learning, which applies the knowledge gained from solving one problem to another relevant problem. The model is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts features from the mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) dataset. Four different CNN architectures were used in thismodel: AlexNet, Xception, ResNeXt, and Channel Boosted CNN. The performance of the model was evaluated using six metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The combination of Xception and Channel Boosted CNN showed excellent performance. By combining essential features from multiple iterations, the Channel Boosted CNN can achieve higher accuracy in breast cancer diagnosis, with an overall accuracy of 98.96%. This highlights the potential of the BCP-TL model in effectively detecting and diagnosing breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe discussion of \"can machines think?\" which started with the invention of the modern computer, brought along the question of \"can machines design?\" by researchers in the design field. These developments in information technologies have also affected the architecture. Artificial intelligence applications are encountered in many areas such as pricing estimation, energy conservation security systems of buildings, ventilation systems, user-oriented interactive design solutions, computer-aided programs used in the plan production phase and design process. When the literature on artificial intelligence applications in the architecture is reviewed, it can be seen that it generally includes shape grammars, graph theory, decision trees, constraint-based models, machine learning methods, RNN (Recursive Neural Networks), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) algorithms. In this study, the use of artificial intelligence algorithms in architecture was examined, and an example was designed to determine the architectural structures of different periods by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). In the study, the open source TensorFlow library developed by Google and the Python programming language were used. Employing a statistical approach and utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a study has successfully classified the current flow patterns of buildings based on datasets comprising facades of Gothic, Modern, and Deconstructivist architectural styles. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of CNNs in accurately distinguishing the intricate details of diverse architectural styles. Recognizing elements from different periods using the CNN algorithm can examine not only individual buildings but also the relationship of buildings with their environments. It can also gain an important place in the field of conservation of the architectural discipline. The historical processes, aesthetic features and changes of protected buildings can be learned with the CNN algorithm and can guide restoration decisions. As a result of the study, the employed CNN-based model can correctly classify structures with 84.66% accuracy rate.",

        "abstract": "Face recognition has become a crucial technology with diverse applications in various domains such as biometric security, healthcare, personal identification, and law enforcement. It stands out due to its high recognition rate, the richness of features, its universality, and its uniqueness. Having said that, challenges such as varying illumination, poses, facial expressions, face transformations, and backgrounds have hindered recognition accuracy, especially when using traditional techniques that rely on explicit feature extraction before the actual classification. The emergence of deep learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has exhibited prominent potential in image recognition capabilities, but building effective face recognition systems from scratch demands substantial labeled data and computational resources.  To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes transfer learning and a pre-trained AlexNet CNN to improve face recognition capabilities. The model is trained with three different deep-learning optimizers, and the most suitable one is selected for the proposed system. For experiments, we created a custom database with images of five distinct individuals, generating over 1260 face images with each person having at least 250 samples. The dataset was further enriched using data augmentation technique. Using MATLAB with the Deep Learning Toolbox, the results demonstrate the model's recognition rate, peaking up to 100 per cent when the SGD optimizer is employed, 97.88 per cent when RMSProp is the optimizer, and 99.2 per cent for the Adam optimizer while using the same set of hyperparameters. These findings showcase the effectiveness of the approach and open doors for more efficient and accurate face recognition systems in real-world scenarios with large datasets.",

        "abstract": "Temporal consistency and content preservation are the prominent challenges in artistic video style transfer. To address these challenges, we present a technique that utilizes depth data and we demonstrate this on real-world videos from the web, as well as on a standard video dataset of three-dimensional computer-generated content. Our algorithm employs an image-transformation network combined with a depth encoder network for stylizing video sequences. For improved global structure preservation and temporal stability, the depth encoder network encodes ground-truth depth information which is fused into the stylization network. To further enforce temporal coherence, we employ ConvLSTM layers in the encoder, and a loss function based on calculated depth information for the output frames is also used. We show that our approach is capable of producing stylized videos with improved temporal consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods whilst also successfully transferring the artistic style of a target painting.",

        "abstract": "Climate change and global warming drive many governments and scientists to investigate new renewable and green energy sources. Special attention is on solar panel technology, since solar energy is considered one of the primary renewable sources and solar panels can be installed in domestic neighborhoods. Photovoltaic (PV) power prediction is essential to match supply and demand and ensure grid stability. However, the PV system has assertive stochastic behavior, requiring advanced forecasting methods, such as machine learning and deep learning, to predict day-ahead PV power accurately. Machine learning models need a rich historical dataset that includes years of PV power outputs to capture hidden patterns between essential variables to predict day-ahead PV power production accurately. Therefore, this study presents a framework based on the transfer learning method to use reliable trained deep learning models of old PV plants in newly installed PV plants in the same neighborhoods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of transfer learning in day-ahead PV prediction in newly established PV plants where a sizable historical dataset of them is unavailable. Among all nine models presented in this study, the LSTM models have better performance in PV power prediction. The new LSTM model using the inadequate dataset has 0.55 mean square error (MSE) and 47.07% weighted mean absolute percentage error (wMAPE), while the transferred LSTM model improves prediction accuracy to 0.168 MSE and 32.04% wMAPE.",

The design of the experiment was based on the previous study by Sun et al. 2022 that compared cognitive differences in artworks between artists and art style transfer. In the experiment of this paper, the stimuli were generated from 24 pairs of digital artworks done by AI and human painters respectively, and participants were asked to differentiate between the stimuli. The results indicated that participants made more correct choices when there was not enough time to process all the details than when there was enough time to consider all the evidence. This study once again demonstrates that rapid cognition holds advantages in analyzing complex information in a short period of time.",

        "abstract": "In our work we propose a new model by segmenting content features (i.e., segregating the feature map into several parts) of the content image in style transfer. We demonstrate that our novel way for style transfer with segmentation ties together the style of both global effect and local appearance that are used in majority of parametric and non-parametric techniques respectively. Our new model can successfully figure out the difficult problems with the current transfer techniques. For one thing, the new model in our research is able to avoid the distortion of local style maps, at the same time it also allows transfer in the level of semanteme compared to parametric means. For another thing, in contrast to other nonparametric approaches, it keeps the style image's overall appearance consistent and avoids washing-out images. We also present a feature optimization strategy based on this. Our trials have proven that our approach is suitable to a wide range of style genes and simultaneously yields higher-quality results over earlier papers.",

        "abstract": "In the rapidly emerging era of untact (“contact-free”) technologies, the requirement for three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments utilized in virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR) and the metaverse has seen significant growth, owing to their extensive application across various domains. Current research focuses on the automatic transfer of the style of rendering images within a 3D virtual environment using artificial intelligence, which aims to minimize human intervention. However, the prevalent studies on rendering-based 3D environment-style transfers have certain inherent limitations. First, the training of a style transfer network dedicated to 3D virtual environments demands considerable style image data. These data must align with viewpoints that closely resemble those of the virtual environment. Second, there was noticeable inconsistency within the 3D structures. Predominant studies often neglect 3D scene geometry information instead of relying solely on 2D input image features. Finally, style adaptation fails to accommodate the unique characteristics inherent in each object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach: a neural rendering-based 3D scene-style conversion technique. This methodology employs semantic nearest-neighbor feature matching, thereby facilitating the transfer of style within a 3D scene while considering the distinctive characteristics of each object, even when employing a single style image. The neural radiance field enables the network to comprehend the geometric information of a 3D scene in relation to its viewpoint. Subsequently, it transfers style features by employing the unique features of a single style image via semantic nearest-neighbor feature matching. In an empirical context, our proposed semantic 3D scene style transfer method was applied to 3D scene style transfers for both interior and exterior environments. This application utilizes the replica, 3DFront, and Tanks and Temples datasets for testing. The results illustrate that the proposed methodology surpasses existing style transfer techniques in terms of maintaining 3D viewpoint consistency, style uniformity, and semantic coherence.",

        "abstract": "Artistic style transfer aims to repaint the content image with the learned artistic style. Existing artistic style transfer methods can be divided into two categories: small model-based approaches and pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches. Small model-based approaches can preserve the content strucuture, but fail to produce highly realistic stylized images and introduce artifacts and disharmonious patterns; Pre-trained large-scale model-based approaches can generate highly realistic stylized images but struggle with preserving the content structure. To address the above issues, we propose ArtBank, a novel artistic style transfer framework, to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of the content images. Specifically, to sufficiently dig out the knowledge embedded in pre-trained large-scale models, an Implicit Style Prompt Bank (ISPB), a set of trainable parameter matrices, is designed to learn and store knowledge from the collection of artworks and behave as a visual prompt to guide pre-trained large-scale models to generate highly realistic stylized images while preserving content structure. Besides, to accelerate training the above ISPB, we propose a novel Spatial-Statistical-based self-Attention Module (SSAM). The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a deep learning approach to photorealistic universal style transfer that extends the PhotoNet network architecture by adding extra feature-aggregation modules. Given a pair of images representing the content and the reference of style, we augment the state-of-the-art solution mentioned above with deeper aggregation, to better fuse content and style information across the decoding layers. As opposed to the more flexible implementation of PhotoNet (i.e., PhotoNAS), which targets the minimization of inference time, our method aims to achieve better image reconstruction and a more pleasant stylization. We propose several deep layer aggregation architectures to be used as wrappers over PhotoNet, to enhance the stylization and quality of the output image.",

        "abstract": "In the late 19th century, Sir Galton started the use of fingerprint recognition as a method for baby identification. However, even after the extent two centuries, fingerprint identification for newborns and toddlers has not advanced to the same level as that for adults. According to research from the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, there is a growing request for fingerprint identification of babies because more than a million of them go missing each year. So, we want to ensure that newborns and toddlers have access to their rights, including vaccinations, healthcare, and nutritional supplements until they reach school age. This paper develops an algorithm that has been used in previous research to recognize newborns and toddlers to produce remarkable and promising results by Pre-trained model deep neural networks and transfer learning to extract the deep features and to get the identification score, aiming to enhance accuracy and validate. The proposed model is validated on the fingerprint dataset of babies named as NITG dataset. The fingerprint recognition model proposed in the research showcases excellent results, where achieved 100% accuracy in training and 90.35% in validation.\r\n ",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Artificial intelligence has been used in many different fields throughout its development, especially in recent years as the amount of data available has increased. Its major objective is to aid individuals in making more reliable decisions more quickly. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are being used more and more in medicine. This is particularly true in the medical field where a large number of digital files must be collected and processed to apply a variety of biomedical imaging and diagnostic techniques. Machine learning is used to analyse medical images, which helps with consistency and increases reporting accuracy. To process chest X-ray data and assist in diagnosis, this study compares transfer learning-based deep neural networks. The study focuses on comparing and evaluating deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks for the identification of pneumonia. To establish the model that would accurately diagnose pneumonia, the researchers developed several different models. Five distinct CNN models, including VGG19, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionNet v3, and YOLO v5, were trained using the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset. Validation Accuracy and Area Under Curve were used to gauge their performance. On test data, VGG16 had the highest validation accuracy (88%) and AUC-ROC (91.8%), whereas YOLO v5 was used to locate the inflammation with a 99% level of confidence.",

        "abstract": "Before neural networks, image style transfer procedures had a common idea: analyze images with a certain style, build a mathematical or statistical model for the style, and then change the image to be transferred, so that it better fits the established model. In this paper, k-means and semantic closed natural matting algorithm is combined for image segmentation, the style and content in the image are extracted based on neural network, and the resulting image is synthesized by image reconstruction technology to realize the migration of national costume styles. Due to the serious artifacts of the output image, an improved image style transfer algorithm is adopted to constrain the transformation from the input image to the output image in the local affine transformation of the color space, and this constraint is expressed as a completely differentiable parameter term, image distortion is suppressed effectively. In the process of real photo style transfer, there is also space inconsistency. Smoothing is done to ensure that the space style is consistent after style processing, it greatly speeds up the operation speed. On NVIDIA GTX1080TI graphics card, algorithm is tested with 256×256 resolution images. It includes three indicators of average running time, memory usage and the number of styles generated by a single model, which are 0.06 s, 136.06 MB and 1 respectively. These indicators can reflect the efficiency and flexibility of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": " Transfer-based attacks, a type of adversarial attack, have become a growing threat in recent years with the proliferation of cloud services. Deep neural networks that exploit human cognitive bias (Loosely Symmetric-Deep Neural Network, LS-DNN) are known as a defensive technique against transfer-based attacks. LS-DNN can prevent malfunctions caused by adversarial examples with a high probability by incorporating human learning characteristics into the neural network’s nodes. However, maintaining accuracy against normal data and reducing Training Time is challenging. This paper proposes a new model called “LS+-DNN” inspired by the Dropout method to solve this problem. Evaluation experiments on two datasets show that the proposed model can achieve both in high dimensions. In addition, we analyze the proposed model focusing on the variance and confidence score of the training parameters of the proposed model. As a result, we point out that the confidence score is an important indicator of robust models against transfer-based attacks. ",

        "abstract": "Transfer learning (TL) has shown great potential to improve Reinforcement Learning (RL) efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge in new tasks. However, much of the existing TL research focuses on transferring knowledge between tasks that share the same state-action spaces.  Further, transfer from multiple source tasks that have different state-action spaces is more challenging and needs to be solved urgently to improve the generalization and practicality of the method in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes TURRET (Transfer Using gRaph neuRal nETworks), to utilize the generalization capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate efficient and effective multi-source policy transfer learning in the state-action mismatch setting.  TURRET learns a semantic representation by accounting for the intrinsic property of the agent through GNNs, which leads to a unified state embedding space for all tasks. As a result, TURRET achieves more efficient transfer with strong generalization ability between different tasks and can be easily combined with existing Deep RL algorithms. Experimental results show that TURRET significantly outperforms other TL methods on multiple continuous action control tasks, successfully transferring across robots with different state-action spaces.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIt is necessary to estimate the temperature field accurately during manufacturing and heat treatment processes to perform an effective manufacturing procedure. Under some situations, the front surface temperature can be determined indirectly by the solution of an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) based on the transient temperature or heat flux measurements taken at the back surface. This study investigates the capability of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach for predicting the front surface temperature and heat flux from the measured back surface parameters. At the early stage, the back surface temperature and heat flux are determined using a direct Python script code. Then, the inverse solution is applied with the help of the fully dense DNN approach. To prevent overfit and non-generalization issues, the regularization and dropout techniques are embedded into the neural network framework. The results reveal that the DNN approach provides more accurate prediction compared to previous mathematical frameworks such as Conjugate Gradient Method (CGM). Moreover, the model is tested by noisy data (from 1% to 10%) causing instabilities in the recovered front surface conditions. Despite of the niose presence, the model can overcome this difficulty and is able to predict the desired parameters with a good accordance.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable progress, with deep learning techniques playing a pivotal role in this transformative journey. One prominent facet of this progress is Neural Style Transfer (NST), a domain within computer vision and image processing. NST entails merging the content of one image with the stylistic attributes of another, resulting in a seamless fusion of content and style. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two influential style transfer models, VGG19 and Magenta, shedding light on their strengths and limitations. VGG19, a well-established convolutional neural network, excels in feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and image classification, making it ideal for computer vision tasks. In contrast, Magenta, a creative content generation framework, specializes in producing innovative content, such as music and art, while promoting human-AI collaboration. Evaluation reveals that Magenta's generated images tend to exhibit softer colors but higher clarity, while VGG19 produces vibrant and faithful color reproductions with finer details. The choice between these models should be driven by specific task requirements. VGG19 is suitable for tasks emphasizing color fidelity, while Magenta excels in image clarity. Future research directions may involve enhancing algorithmic capabilities to harness the strengths of both models and improving efficiency in style transfer techniques. This analysis empowers researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to make informed decisions when selecting a model aligned with their objectives, contributing to the evolving landscape of AI-assisted creative content generation.",

        "abstract": "Depth extraction generative adversarial network (DE-GAN) is designed for artistic work style transfer. Traditional style transfer models focus on extracting texture features and color features from style images through an autoencoding network by mixing texture features and color features using high-dimensional coding. In the aesthetics of artworks, the color, texture, shape, and spatial features of the artistic object together constitute the artistic style of the work. In this paper, we propose a multi-feature extractor to extract color features, texture features, depth features, and shape masks from style images with U-net, multi-factor extractor, fast Fourier transform, and MiDas depth estimation network. At the same time, a self-encoder structure is used as the content extraction network core to generate a network that shares style parameters with the feature extraction network and finally realizes the generation of artwork images in three-dimensional artistic styles. The experimental analysis shows that compared with other advanced methods, DE-GAN-generated images have higher subjective image quality, and the generated style pictures are more consistent with the aesthetic characteristics of real works of art. The quantitative data analysis shows that images generated using the DE-GAN method have better performance in terms of structural features, image distortion, image clarity, and texture details.",

So, inversion with AI becomes appropriate to extract information from post-stack data. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) and deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) inverted seismic data using multiattributes, and their results were compared with those provided by a model-based inversion (MBI). Applied to a post-stack volume of the Frontier Formation at the Teapot-Dome field, Wyoming-USA, the three methods provided porosity volumes (ϕ), gamma rays (GR), and Lamé impedances (µρ, λρ). The comparison between well-logs and the provided volumes revealed a reliable PNN prediction, while DFNN achieved the best geologically correlated parameter sections and a less reliable MBI prediction. The geomorphological time-slice analysis discriminated high ϕ-µρ areas and low GR–λρ areas, geologically interpreted as a deltaic environment, with distributary channels and beachfront lobes subject to the action of the tides, which agrees with the well-log interpretation and the basin geological evolution. The results enhanced the stacked section’s importance by the geological information contained, which would contribute to reducing the prospecting risk. Finally, PNN and DFNN encouraging results reaffirm their best searching-in-multivariate space ability.",
