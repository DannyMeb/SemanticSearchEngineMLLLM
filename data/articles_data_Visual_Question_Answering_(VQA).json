The system consists of the Visual Query Generation (VQG) and Visual Question Answer (VQA) modules. VQG generates questions based on visual cues, and VQA provides matching answers to the VQG modules. VQG system generates questions using LSTM and VGG19 model, training parameters, and predicting words with the highest probability for output. VQA uses VGG-19 convolutional neural network for image encoding, embedding, and multilayer perceptron for high-quality responses. The proposed system reduces the need for human annotation and thus supports the traditional education sector by significantly reducing the human intervention required to generate text queries. The system can be used in interactive interfaces to help young children learn.",

        "abstract": "Natural disasters are a major source of significant damage and costly repairs around the world. After a natural disaster occurs, there is usually a significant amount of damage, and with that, there are also a lot of costs involved with repairing and aiding all the people involved. In addition, the occurrence of natural phenomena has increased significantly in the past decade. With that in mind, post-disaster damage detection is usually performed manually by human operators. Taking into consideration all the areas one has to closely look into, as well as the difficult terrain and places with hard access, it becomes easy to understand how incredibly difficult it is for a surveyor to identify and annotate every single possible damage out there. Because of that, it has become essential to find new creative solutions for damage detection and classification in the case of natural disasters, especially hurricanes. This study focuses on the feasibility of using a Visual Question Answering (VQA) method for post-disaster damage detection, using aerial footage taken from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Two other approaches are also utilized to provide comparison and to evaluate the performance of VQA. Our case study on our custom dataset collected after Hurricane Sally shows successful results using VQA for post-disaster damage detection applications.",

        "abstract": "In 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA), the scarcity of fully annotated data and limited visual content diversity hampers the generalization to novel scenes and 3D concepts (e.g., only around 800 scenes are utilized in ScanQA and SQA dataset). Current approaches resort supplement 3D reasoning with 2D information. However, these methods face challenges: either they use top-down 2D views that introduce overly complex and sometimes question-irrelevant visual clues, or they rely on globally aggregated scene/image-level representations from 2D VLMs, losing the fine-grained vision-language correlations. To overcome these limitations, our approach utilizes question-conditional 2D view selection procedure, pinpointing semantically relevant 2D inputs for crucial visual clues. We then integrate this 2D knowledge into the 3D-VQA system via a two-branch Transformer structure. This structure, featuring a Twin-Transformer design, compactly combines 2D and 3D modalities and captures fine-grained correlations between modalities, allowing them mutually augmenting each other. Integrating proposed mechanisms above, we present BridgeQA, that offers a fresh perspective on multi-modal transformer-based architectures for 3D-VQA. Experiments validate that BridgeQA achieves state-of-the-art on 3D-VQA datasets and significantly outperforms existing solutions. Code is available at https://github.com/matthewdm0816/BridgeQA.",

Under these research circumstances, the demand for multilingual evaluation of visual question answering (VQA) tasks, a representative task of multimodal systems, has increased. Accordingly, we propose a bilingual outside-knowledge VQA (BOK-VQA) dataset in this study that can be extended to multilingualism. The proposed data include 17K images, 17K question-answer pairs for both Korean and English and 280K instances of knowledge information related to question-answer content. We also present a framework that can effectively inject knowledge information into a VQA system by pretraining the knowledge information of BOK-VQA data in the form of graph embeddings. Finally, through in-depth analysis, we demonstrated the actual effect of the knowledge information contained in the constructed training data on VQA.",

        "abstract": "Understanding multiple modalities and relating them is an easy task for humans. But for machines, this is a stimulating task. One such multi-modal reasoning task is Visual question answering which demands the machine to produce an answer for the natural language query asked based on the given image. Although plenty of work is done in this field, there is still a challenge of improving the answer prediction ability of the model and breaching human accuracy. A novel model for answering image-based questions based on a transformer has been proposed. The proposed model is a fully Transformer-based architecture that utilizes the power of a transformer for extracting language features as well as for performing joint understanding of question and image features. The proposed VQA model utilizes F-RCNN for image feature extraction. The retrieved language features and object-level image features are fed to a decoder inspired by the Bi-Directional Encoder Representation Transformer - BERT architecture that learns jointly the image characteristics directed by the question characteristics and rich representations of the image features are obtained. Extensive experimentation has been carried out to observe the effect of various hyperparameters on the performance of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the modelâs ability to predict the answer increases with the increase in the number of layers in the transformerâs encoder and decoder.

However, since relying heavily on human instructions, i.e., annotations or priors, current contrastive learning-based VideoQA methods remains challenging to perform fine-grained visual-linguistic alignments. In this work, we innovatively resort to game theory, which can simulate complicated relationships among multiple players with specific interaction strategies, e.g., video, question, and answer as ternary players, to achieve fine-grained alignment for VideoQA task. Specifically, we carefully design a VideoQA-specific interaction strategy to tailor the characteristics of VideoQA, which can mathematically generate the fine-grained visual-linguistic alignment label without label-intensive efforts. Our TG-VQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art by a large margin (more than 5%) on long-term and short-term VideoQA datasets, verifying its effectiveness and generalization ability. Thanks to the guidance of game-theoretic interaction, our model impressively convergences well on limited data (10^4 videos), surpassing most of those pre-trained on large-scale data (10^7 videos).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recently years, some visual question answering (VQA) methods that emphasize the simultaneous understanding of both the context of image and question have been proposed. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they fail to explore a more comprehensive and generalized context learning tactics. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multiple Context Learning Networks (MCLN) to model the multiple contexts for VQA. Three kinds of contexts are investigated, namely visual context, textual context and a special visual-textual context that ignored by previous methods. Moreover, three corresponding context learning modules are proposed. These modules endow image and text representations with context-aware information based on a uniform context learning strategy. And they work together to form a multiple context learning layer (MCL). Such MCL can be stacked in depth and which describe high-level context information by associating intra-modal contexts with inter-modal context. On the VQA v2.0 datasets, the proposed model achieves 71.05% and 71.48% on test-dev set and test-std set respectively, and gains better performance than the previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, extensive ablation studies have been carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This paper proposes an approach to learn multimodal feature representation with adversarial training. The purpose of the adversarial training allows the model to learn from standard fusion methods in an unsupervised manner. The discriminator model is equipped with a siamese combinatin of two standard fusion method namely multimodal compact bilinear pooling and multimodal tucker fusion. Output multimodal feature representation from generator is a resultant of graph convolutional operation. The resultant multimodal representation of the adversarial training allows the proposed model to infer the correct answers from open-ended natural language questions from the VQA 2.0 dataset. An overall accuracy of 69.86\\% demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed model.",

Combining the self-attention (SA) models, we reweight the vital feature to locate the critical information on the whiteboard and students&rsquo; faces and further recognize their content and facial expressions. Three branches of information are encoded into the feature vectors to be fed into a bidirectional GRU network. With the real labels of the studentsâ answers annotated by two teachers and the predicted labels from the text and facial expression feedback, we train the chained network.

        "abstract": "Language bias stands as a noteworthy concern in Visual Question Answering (VQA), wherein models tend to rely on spurious correlations between questions and answers for prediction. This prevents the models from effectively generalizing, leading to a decrease in performance. To address this bias, we propose a novel modality fusion collaborative de-biasing algorithm (CoD). In our approach, bias is considered as the modelâs neglect of information from a particular modality during prediction. We employ a collaborative training approach to facilitate mutual modeling between different modalities, achieving efficient feature fusion and enabling the model to fully leverage multi-modal knowledge for prediction. Our experiments on various datasets, including VQA-CP v2, VQA v2, and VQA-VS, using different validation strategies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, employing a basic baseline model resulted in an accuracy of 60.14% on VQA-CP v2.",
