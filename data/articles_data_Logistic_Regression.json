        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe prediction of early childhood numeracy skills development is often studied by determining the learner’s performance in a numeracy test. It is an important study area since numeracy impacts on the learner’s mathematical and statistical abilities later in life. Despite having pros and cons over each other, classification algorithms are often applied in the prediction of early childhood numeracy skills development without justifying the choice of a certain algorithm over others. In this paper, the bi-directional stepwise logistic regression model (SLRM), hierarchical logistic regression model (HLRM), classification and regression tree (CART) and Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm were compared in terms of their ability to accurately classify some learners as having passed or having failed a numeracy test. The intention was to determine the most accurate algorithm from the four relative to predicting the learner’s performance in a numeracy test. The algorithms were compared using the true positive rate, true negative rate, specificity, sensitivity, classification error, classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. The results showed that the HLRM which has been applied by several previous studies on the prediction of numeracy test competence is the best classifier followed by SLRM, CART then NB. The study also confirmed some important predictors of the learner’s performance in a numeracy test some of which were also identified by some previous studies on early childhood numeracy development. Some gaps and recommendations for future research pertaining to the classification algorithms as well as implications for practice were also highlighted. We have made the HLRM scoring algorithm generated from SPSS available as a supplementary material and can be used to classify a set of new learners to either the pass or fail group.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the fuzzy semi-parametric logistic quantile regression model was studied in the absence of special conditions in the classical regression models. This model becomes more flexible to deal with data for outlier's values and in the absence of a linear regression condition when the data of the dependent variable are restricted and fuzzy data and some of the variables are nonparametric, and the dependent variable in this model represents the fuzzy triangular number.\r\nThe estimation of the semi-parametric logistic quantile regression model has been applied to simulated data when the sample size is (25, 50, 75, 100) and with a repetition of 1000. Where the model is estimated in two steps, the first step is to estimate the parametric part, and the second step is to estimate the non-parametric part by the Nadaraya-Watson estimator through different kernel functions. Depending on the mean squares error and the measure of goodness of fit, the results indicated the best estimate of a model with the Kernel-Cassian function when the quantile of the fuzzy conditional distribution equals 0.2 for all sample sizes  .",

Analisis terhadap financial distress sangat perlu dilakukan sejak awal untuk mengantisipasi bangkrutnya perusahaan. Perlu dikembangkan suatu model yang menggambarkan prediksi kebangkrutan suatu perusahaan melalui analisis financial distress sebuah perusahaan. Dengan mengetahui penyebab financial distress perusahaan akan lebih bersikap lebih hati-hati dalam pengambilan keputusan keuangan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis apakah-apakah faktor-faktor likuidity, financial leverage, asset utilization dan profitability dapat memprediksi financial distress perusahaan. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh perusahaan manufaktur yang terdaftar di Bursa Efek Indonesia. Metode pengambilan sampel dilakukan dengan metode purposive sampling dengan beberapa kriteria yang ditetapkan.Model yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah model regressi logistic yang bertujuan untuk menguji probabilitas terjadinya variabel terikat financial distress dapat diprediksi dengan variabel bebasnya yaitu likuidity, financial leverage, asset utilization dan profitabilility.  Persamaan model yang dikembangkan dalam penelitian ini adalah :Y = ( FD/1-FD ) = β0 + β1X1+β2X2+β3X3+β4X4Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh perusahaan manufaktur yang terdaftar di Bursa Efek Indonesia berjumlah 136  perusahaan. Dengan criteria tertentu terpilih  50 perusahaan yang digunakan sebagai sampel. Periode penelitian tahun 2010 sd 2012.Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa secara simultan likuidity, financial leverage, asset utilization, profitability  dapat memprediksi kondisi financial distress perusahaan.

        "abstract": "Validity of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis has been tested by several researchers. While macro approaches towards EKC hypothesis are largely discussed in the literature, microeconomic approaches are quite scarce. This paper, in this respect, aims to provide individual insights on the environmental preferences. Using individual priority towards environmental protection rather than economic growth as an environmental indicator, I investigate individual factors affecting this preference. To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first attempt that explains individual environmental preferences by a wide range of individual characteristics exploiting individual observations from more than a hundred countries for the period of 1995-2020. The findings indicate that there is no clear evidence to support EKC hypothesis. However, significant effects of age, gender, education, unemployment, along with further significant explanatory variables are expected to be useful to make appropriate policies for a greener future.",

        "abstract": "Credit risk is the risk that has the greatest opportunity to occur in banking. The number of bad loans will also affect bank performance. The banking sector needs to know whether a prospective creditor is classified as a risky person or not. The purpose of this study is to classify creditors and compare the classification results through logistic regression with the maximum likelihood model and the Boosting algorithm, especially the AdaBoost algorithm, and to select a model with the Boosting algorithm Credit Scoring aims to classify prospective creditor into two classes, namely good prospective creditor (Performing Loan) and bad prospective creditor (Non Performing Loan) based on certain characteristics. The method often used for classifying creditor is logistic regression, but this method is less robust and less accurate than data mining. Thus, there is a need for methods that provide greater accuracy. Among the methods that have been proposed is a method called Boosting, which operates sequentially by applying a classification algorithm to the reweighted version of the training data set. This study uses 5 datasets. The first dataset is secondary data originating from data on non-subsidized homeownership creditors of Bank X Malang City. While the other datasets are simulation data with many samples of 10, 500, and 1000. The results of this study indicate that ensemble boosting logistic regression is more suitable for describing binary response problems, especially creditor classification because it provides more accurate information. For high-dimensional data, which is represented by a sample size of 10, ensemble logistic regression is proven to be able to produce fairly accurate predictions with an accuracy rate of up to 80%, whereas in the logistic regression analysis the model raises N.A because many samples < many independent variables. The use of boosting is preferred because it focuses on problems that are misclassified and have a tendency to increase to higher accuracy.",

        "abstract": "It is widely believed that regression models for binary responses are problematic if we want to compare estimated coefficients from models for different groups or with different explanatory variables. This concern has two forms. The first arises if the binary model is treated as an estimate of a model for an unobserved continuous response, and the second when models are compared between groups which have different distributions of other causes of the binary response. We argue that these concerns are usually  misplaced. The first of them is only relevant if the  unobserved continuous response is really the subject of substantive interest. If it is, the problem should be addressed through better measurement of this response. The second concern refers to a situation which is  unavoidable but unproblematic, in that causal effects and descriptive associations are inherently group-dependent and can be compared as long as they are correctly estimated.",

        "abstract": "Kubu Raya Regency is a regency in the province of West Kalimantan which has a wetland ecosystem including a high-density swamp or peatland ecosystem along with an extensive area of mangroves. The function of wetland ecosystems is essential for fauna, as a source of livelihood for the surrounding community and as storage reservoir for carbon stocks. Most of the land in Kubu Raya Regency is peatland. As a consequence, peat has long been used for agriculture and as a source of livelihood for the community. Along with the vast area of peat, the regency also has a potential high risk of peat fires. This study aims to predict land use changes in Kubu Raya Regency using three statistical machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Additive Logistic Regression (ALR). Land cover map data were acquired from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and subsequently reclassified into six types of land cover at a resolution of 100 m. The land cover data were employed to classify land use or land cover class for the Kubu Raya regency, for the years 2009, 2015 and 2020. Based on model performance, RF provides greater accuracy and F1 score as opposed to LR and ALR. The outcome of this study is expected to provide knowledge and recommendations that may aid in developing future sustainable development planning and management for Kubu Raya Regency.",

Chen et al. proved that this method is inappropriate and proposed a score test for the mixed logistic regression (MLR). However this test does not allow an estimation of the variants’ effects.ResultsWe propose two computationally efficient methods to estimate the variants’ effects. Their properties are evaluated on two simulations sets, and compared with other methods (MLM, logistic regression). MLR performs the best in all circumstances. The variants’ effects are well evaluated by our methods, with a moderate bias when the effect sizes are large. Additionally, we propose a stratified QQ-plot, enhancing the diagnosis of p-values inflation or deflation, when population strata are not clearly identified in the sample.AvailabilityAll methods are implemented in the R package milorGWAS available at https://github.com/genostats/milorGWAS.Contactherve.perdry@u-psud.frSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "Logistic regression plays an important role in medical research, and several machine learning extensions exist for this framework, including least angle regression (LARS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which yield models with interpretable regression coefficients. Many machine learning algorithms have benefitted in the past few years from the inclusion of geometric and topological information, including manifold learning, shape-matching, and supervised learning extensions of generalized linear regression. This study demonstrates gains from the inclusion of differential geometric information in LARS models and of homotopy search in LASSO models above that of elastic net regression, a state-of-the-art penalized regression algorithm. Results hold across both simulated data and two real datasets, one predicting alcoholism risk and one predicting tumor malignancy. These algorithms also perform competitively with classification algorithms such as random forest and boosted regression, suggesting that machine learning methods which incorporate topological/geometric information about the underlying data may be useful on binary classification datasets within medical research. In addition, other hybrid techniques may outperform existing methods and provide more accurate models to understand disease. More work is needed to develop effective, efficient algorithms that explore the topology or geometry of data space and provide interpretable models.",

The analysis of choice behavior data in behavior analysis has been performed by three main types of methods. They are logit analysis, probit analysis and complementary log-log analysis. These analyses are often discussed in comparison with the predictions of the generalized matching law (Baum, 1974, 1979). In this study, nine types of data were artificially generated that follow the generalized matching law, and three types of logistic regression analyses (logit, probit, and complementary log-log function model) were performed. A comparison of the results of these analyses with AIC weight revealed that there are appropriate variable transformations depending on the statistical characteristics of the data being analyzed and that a particular transformation model does not always make good predictions.",

Therefore, the author aims to highlight the development and validation of predictive models determining neurosurgical outcomes through machine learning algorithms using logistic regression.Methods: Logistic regression (enter, backward and forward) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for selection of variables from selected database can eventually lead to multiple candidate models. The final model with a set of predictive variables must be selected based upon the clinical knowledge and numerical results.Results: The predictive model which performed best on the discrimination, calibration, Brier score and decision curve analysis must be selected to develop machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression should be compared with the LASSO model. Usually for the big databases, the predictive model selected through logistic regression gives higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) than those with LASSO model. The predictive probability derived from the best model could be uploaded to an open access web application which is easily deployed by the patients and surgeons to make a risk assessment world-wide.Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms provide promising results for the prediction of outcomes following cranial and spinal surgery. These algorithms can provide useful factors for patient-counselling, assessing peri-operative risk factors, and predicting post-operative outcomes after neurosurgery.",

        "abstract": "The development of personal identification methods based on bone remains, which are used to diagnose the population of Azerbaijan, is a priority task due to the unresolved issue. In this scenario, a new method for quickly determining sex by teeth is in demand, as it should increase the efficiency of the work of forensic experts.  The purpose of this study was to develop modern methods for diagnosing human sex using odontometric studies.  At the craniological collection of Azerbaijanis, the sizes of teeth were studied. On 7 teeth of the upper and 7 teeth of the lower jaw, 3 parameters were measured (in this case, symmetrical teeth were considered as a single array). Each of the 14 anatomical teeth was represented by 80 male and 80 female teeth. For odontometric procedures, a Mutitouyo digital caliper (accuracy 10 microns) was used. The results of odontometry were analyzed by statistical methods using ROC analysis. Mathematical modeling was carried out using the MATLAB statistical software package.  With the help of ROC-analysis, the data obtained during odontometry were considered. 6 odontometric signs were established, which are interconnected with gender. The most correlated with gender were the bucco-lingual diameter of the upper canine, as well as the heights of the crowns – the second lower molar, lower incisors, lower canine and upper medial incisor. Using mathematical modeling, we have developed 6 logistic regression equations that can be used to determine the gender of a person by the size of his teeth. The predictive potential of the equations was also evaluated using ROC analysis procedures.  As a result of the study, based on odontometric indicators and by using ROC analysis, diagnostic equations were obtained to determine the sex of a person by the size of the teeth. The equations have not yet been verified on independent samples, so they cannot yet be unconditionally recommended for practice. Nevertheless, the authors count on the high legitimacy of their own models due to the fact that they used a fairly powerful mathematical apparatus.",
