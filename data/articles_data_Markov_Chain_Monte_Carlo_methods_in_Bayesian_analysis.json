        "abstract": "A crucial challenge in Bayesian modeling using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation is to diagnose the convergence of the chains so that the draws can be expected to closely approximate the posterior distribution on which inference is based. A close approximation guarantees that the MCMC error exhibits only a negligible impact on model estimates and inferences. However, determining whether convergence has been achieved can often be challenging and cumbersome when relying solely on inspecting the trace plots of the chain(s) or manually checking the stopping criteria. In this article, we present a SAS macro called %automcmc that is based on PROC MCMC and that automatically continues to add draws until a user-specified stopping criterion (i.e., a certain potential scale reduction and/or a certain effective sample size) is reached for the chain(s).",

These algorithms are applied to calculate parameter values of predictive models of the phenomenon of varying volatility in data time series. For this purpose, 3 such research models of time-varying volatility are simulated in STAN a probabilistic programming language for statistical inference. The accuracy of these models’ predictive function is confirmed by applying in data time series with known prior values. Moreover, Stan models’ performance is illustrated by the real stock prices of two shares in the stock market of New York. Finally, an Information Criterion of the results is applied to each model as well, to evaluate their predictive ability, comparing and selecting the most effective one.\n\nKeywords: MCMC, Time-series, Time-varying volatility models, STAN.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents a novel Bayesian method for backcalculation of pavement dynamic modulus, stiffness, thickness, and damping using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) data. The backcalculation procedure yields estimates and uncertainties for each pavement property of interest. As a by‐product of the Bayesian procedure, information about measurement error is recovered. The Bayesian method is tested on simulated FWD backcalculations and compared with a state‐of‐the‐art trust‐region optimization algorithm, and it achieves estimation errors that are nearly an order of magnitude lower than the trust‐region solver. Confidence intervals are computed from thousands of simulated backcalculations and are shown to quantify uncertainty in estimated pavement properties. To cope with the computational expense of backcalculation, a fully parallel transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure is developed. The fully parallel algorithm scales well to computation with many processor cores, and it yields up to a 50% reduction in computation time when compared to existing parallel implementations.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWell logs are geophysical measurements of rock properties acquired continuously along a borehole. Because of the physics underlying their operation, borehole logging instruments perform local spatial averages of rock properties in the vicinity of the borehole, yielding well logs that are often affected by tool design, layer boundaries, borehole environmental conditions and mud‐filtrate invasion. Such environmental effects are ubiquitous and can lead to errors in petrophysical–property estimations from well logs if not accounted for in the interpretation. Separate well‐log inversion mitigates environmental effects by matching well logs with their numerical simulations. The latter simulations rely on specific assumptions about the relative geometry of the borehole and the rocks penetrated by the well. For vertical wells penetrating horizontal layers, it is common to assume piecewise‐constant layer properties that we collectively refer to as the earth model; some of these properties have a direct relationship to well logs (e.g. resistivity, gamma ray, density and acoustic slowness). Well‐log inversion is traditionally approached with deterministic methods such as the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize the differences between well logs and their numerical simulations, often without accounting for the relationship between measurement noise and model uncertainty. Bayesian inversion, on the other hand, yields the posterior probability distribution of estimated properties and intrinsically quantifies their uncertainty. However, Bayesian Well‐log inversion usually involves the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, which requires a prohibitive number of forward simulations and is therefore not suitable for rapid petrophysical and/or elastic and mechanical evaluations of rocks. We introduce an efficient Bayesian Well‐log inversion method using a gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo is a group of relatively new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that combine gradient updates with Hessian‐based sampling. gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo draws samples efficiently from the posterior probability distribution using the gradient information to guide samples towards high‐probability regions and the Hessian to approximate the posterior probability distribution locally. We verify the gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion method with the inversion of synthetic well logs, including gamma ray, resistivity, density, neutron porosity, photoelectric factor and compressional/shear‐wave slowness. Results show that gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo decreases the computational cost by more than 90% compared to conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Next, gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion is applied to a field example from the Central North Sea, where conventional interpretation methods yield shale concentration, sandstone porosity and water saturation with errors up to 19.2%, 14.9% and 48.8%, respectively. Gradient‐based Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion products satisfactorily reproduce the available measurements with only a modest increase in computational cost compared to deterministic inversion approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose a very fast approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling framework that is applicable to a large class of sparse Bayesian inference problems. The computational cost per iteration in several regression models is of order O(n(s+J)), where n is the sample size, s is the underlying sparsity of the model, and J is the size of a randomly selected subset of regressors. This cost can be further reduced by data sub-sampling when stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics are employed. The algorithm is an extension of the asynchronous Gibbs sampler of Johnson et al. [(2013). Analyzing Hogwild parallel Gaussian Gibbs sampling. In Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS’13) (Vol. 2, pp. 2715–2723)], but can be viewed from a statistical perspective as a form of Bayesian iterated sure independent screening [Fan, J., Samworth, R., & Wu, Y. (2009). Ultrahigh dimensional feature selection: Beyond the linear model. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 10, 2013–2038]. We show that in high-dimensional linear regression problems, the Markov chain generated by the proposed algorithm admits an invariant distribution that recovers correctly the main signal with high probability under some statistical assumptions. Furthermore, we show that its mixing time is at most linear in the number of regressors. We illustrate the algorithm with several models.",

        "abstract": "Divide‐and‐conquer strategies for Monte Carlo algorithms are an increasingly popular approach to making Bayesian inference scalable to large data sets. In its simplest form, the data are partitioned across multiple computing cores and a separate Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm on each core targets the associated partial posterior distribution, which we refer to as a sub‐posterior, that is, the posterior given only the data from the segment of the partition associated with that core. Divide‐and‐conquer techniques reduce computational, memory and disk bottle necks but make it difficult to recombine the sub‐posterior samples. We propose SwISS: Sub‐posteriors with Inflation, Scaling and Shifting; a new approach for recombining the sub‐posterior samples, which is simple to apply, scales to high‐dimensional parameter spaces and accurately approximates the original posterior distribution through affine transformations of the sub‐posterior samples. We prove that our transformation is asymptotically optimal across a natural set of affine transformations and illustrate the efficacy of SwISS against competing algorithms on synthetic and real‐world data sets.",

Additionally, the presence of a strong correlation structure among the features makes it hard to determine the impactful variables with the usual statistical procedure. The present paper deals with analysing real life wide Modified Rankin Score dataset within a Bayesian framework using a logistic regression model by employing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

        "abstract": " Seismic facies classification aims to predict a facies model, or a set of facies models, from measured seismic data. We focus on stochastic classification methods to estimate the probability distribution of facies conditioned on seismic data. Bayesian classification methods based on analytical solutions are generally applied to seismically inverted elastic attributes or petrophysical properties rather than measured seismic data, and they do not include spatial correlation models in the prior distribution. Instead, iterative stochastic methods, such as Monte Carlo acceptance-rejection sampling and approximate Bayesian computation, can be directly applied to seismic data and can be implemented with complex prior models; however, their convergence is generally slow because it requires the simulation of a large number of facies models from the prior distribution. We develop an efficient implementation of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach that adopts complex prior models, such as multiple-point statistics simulations based on a training image, to generate geologically realistic facies realizations. The novelty of the approach is that the proposal distribution of the proposed MCMC method is based on a gradual deformation algorithm, in which the proposal distribution is expressed as a linear combination of the indicator variables of the previously accepted model and a random prior simulation, according to a uniform random weight. The synthetic examples indicate accurate facies predictions with a success rate of approximately 80% for well-log facies classification based on elastic attributes and approximately 60% for seismic facies classification based on seismic data. The inversion is compared to an MCMC method with prior models sampled from a first-order Markov chain and Bayesian facies classification. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractAs all kinds of numerical models are emerging in hydrologic and hydraulic engineering, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is one of the popular multi‐model methods used to account for various uncertainties in the flood modeling process and generate robust ensemble predictions. The reliability of BMA parameters (weights and variances) determines the accuracy of BMA predictions. However, the uncertainty in BMA parameters with fixed values, which are usually obtained from Expectation‐Maximization (EM) algorithm, has not been adequately investigated in BMA‐related applications over the past few decades. Given the limitations of the default EM algorithm, Metropolis‐Hastings (M‐H) algorithm, which is one of the most widely used algorithms in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is proposed to estimate BMA parameters. Both numerical experiments and one‐dimensional Hydrologic Engineering Center‐River Analysis System models are employed to examine the applicability of M‐H algorithm with multiple independent Markov chains. The performances of EM and M‐H algorithms are compared based on the daily water stage predictions from 10 model members. Results show that BMA weights estimated from both algorithms are comparable, while BMA variances obtained from M‐H algorithm are closer to the given variances in the numerical experiment. Moreover, the normal proposal distribution used in M‐H algorithm can yield narrower distributions for BMA weights than those from the uniform proposal distribution. Overall, MCMC approach with multiple chains can provide more information associated with the uncertainty of BMA parameters and its performance is better than the default EM algorithm in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics as well as algorithm flexibility.",

A newly developed model class identification algorithm was extended and integrated with the MCMC-based Bayesian approach for the first time to identify the CA mortar void that may partly extend to a neighborhood region. Not only the most probable values of the scaling factors to the mortar stiffness can be calculated, but also the damage probability of model parameters using the posterior probability density function (PDF) can be estimated, and the void can be clearly identified by the MCMC-based Bayesian approach. The proposed methodology was experimentally verified and positive outcomes were obtained. The detection results illustrate that the proposed method not only can successfully assess the void location of the CA mortar but also provide the information of the damage severity, and the posterior PDFs of model parameters can be also calculated by using kernel density estimation to quantitatively describe the uncertainty of the model.

This work proposes a robust history-matching workflow utilizing the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network to perform history matching under uncertainties for geothermal resource development efficiently. There are mainly four steps. Step 1: Identifying uncertainty parameters. Step 2: The BiLSTM is built to map the nonlinear relationship between the key uncertainty parameters (e.g., injection rates, reservoir temperature, etc.) and time series outputs (temperature of producer). Bayesian optimization is used to automate the tuning process of the hyper-parameters. Step 3: The Bayesian MCMC is performed to inverse the uncertainty parameters. The BiLSTM is served as the forward model to reduce the computational expense. Step 4: If the errors of the predicted response between the high-fidelity model and Bayesian MCMC are high, we need to revisit the accuracy of the BiLSTM and the prior information on the uncertainty parameters. We demonstrate the proposed method using a 3D fractured geothermal reservoir, where the cold water is injected into a geothermal reservoir, and the energy is extracted by producing hot water in a producer. Results show that the proposed Bayesian MCMC and BiLSTM method can successfully inverse the uncertainty parameters with narrow uncertainties by comparing the inversed parameters and the ground truth. We then compare its superiority with models like PCE, Kriging, and SVR, and our method achieves the highest accuracy. We propose a Bayesian MCMC and BiLSTM-based history matching method for uncertainty parameters inversion and demonstrate its accuracy and robustness compared with other models. This approach provides an efficient and practical history-matching method for geothermal extraction with significant uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "Phylogenetic estimation is, and has always been, a complex endeavor. Estimating a phylogenetic tree involves evaluating many possible solutions and possible evolutionary histories that could explain a set of observed data, typically by using a model of evolution. Modern statistical methods involve not just the estimation of a tree, but also solutions to more complex models involving fossil record information and other data sources. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a leading method for approximating the posterior distribution of parameters in a mathematical model. It is deployed in all Bayesian phylogenetic tree estimation software. While many researchers use MCMC in phylogenetic analyses, interpreting results and diagnosing problems with MCMC remain vexing issues to many biologists. In this manuscript, we will offer an overview of how MCMC is used in Bayesian phylogenetic inference, with a particular emphasis on complex hierarchical models, such as the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model. We will discuss strategies to diagnose common MCMC problems and troubleshoot difficult analyses, in particular convergence issues. We will show how the study design, the choice of models and priors, but also technical features of the inference tools themselves can all be adjusted to obtain the best results. Finally, we will also discuss the unique challenges created by the incorporation of fossil information in phylogenetic inference, and present tips to address them.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nThe most recent WHO guideline on antenatal care (ANC) utilization reaffirmed the necessary and compulsory care and services a pregnant woman should receive to maximize the importance and gains of ANC. While most studies focused on the time of initiation and number of ANC contacts, emphasis was rarely placed on the components of ANC offered to women. This study assessed how complete the components of ANC received by pregnant women are as a proxy for the quality of ANC services offered in Nigeria. We also assessed the clustering of the components and state-level differentials and inequalities in the components of ANC received in Nigeria.\n\nMethods\nWe used nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey. We analysed the data of 11,867 women who had at least one ANC contact during the most recent pregnancy within five years preceding the survey. The assessed components were tetanus injection, blood pressure, urine test, blood test, iron supplement, malaria intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and told about danger signs. Others are intestinal parasite drugs (IPD)intermittent and HIV/PMTCT counsel. Descriptive statistics, bivariable and multivariable multilevel Bayesian Monte Carlo Poisson models were used.\n\nResults\nIn all, 94% had blood pressure measured, 91% received tetanus injection, had iron supplement-89%, blood test-87%, urine test-86%, IPTp-24%, danger signs-80%, HIV/PMTC-82% and IPD-22%. The overall prevalence of receiving all 9 components was 5% and highest in Ogun (24%) and lowest in Kebbi state (0.1%). The earlier the initiation of ANC, the higher the number of contacts, and the higher the quality of ANC received. Respondents with higher education have a 4% (adjusted incidence risk ratio (aIRR): 1.04, 95% credible interval (CrI): 1.01–1.09) higher risk of receiving more components of ANC relative to those with no education. The risk of receiving more ANC components was 5% (aIRRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.10) higher among pregnant women aged 40 to 49 years than those aged 15 to 19 years. Women who decide their healthcare utilization alone had a 2% higher risk of getting more components than those whose spouses are the only decision taker of healthcare use. Other significant factors were household wealth status, spouse education, ethnicity, place of ANC, and skill of ANC provider. Pregnant women who had their blood pressure measured were very likely to have blood and urine tests, tetanus injections, iron supplements, and HIV talks.\n\nConclusions\nOnly one in every 20 pregnant women received all the 9 ANC components with wide disparities and inequalities across the background characteristics and the States of residence in Nigeria. There is a need to ensure that all pregnant women receive adequate components. Stakeholders should increase supplies, train, and create awareness among ANC providers and pregnant women in particular.\n",

        "abstract": "We introduce a generalized micro–macro Markov chain Monte Carlo (mM-MCMC) method with pseudo-marginal approximation to the free energy that is able to accelerate sampling of the microscopic Gibbs distributions when there is a time-scale separation between the macroscopic dynamics of a reaction coordinate and the remaining microscopic degrees of freedom. The mM-MCMC method attains this efficiency by iterating four steps: (i) propose a new value of the reaction coordinate, (ii) accept or reject the macroscopic sample, (iii) run a biased simulation that creates a microscopic molecular instance that lies close to the newly sampled macroscopic reaction coordinate value, and (iv) microscopic accept/reject step for the new microscopic sample. In the present paper, we eliminate the main computational bottleneck of earlier versions of this method: the necessity to have an accurate approximation of free energy. We show that the introduction of a pseudo-marginal approximation significantly reduces the computational cost of the microscopic accept/reject step while still providing unbiased samples. We illustrate the method’s behavior on several molecular systems with low-dimensional reaction coordinates.",

This can be interpreted as a wave function of the Universe, for which we compute boundary geometrical operators, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. The numerical calculation is made possible by adapting the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, along with recently developed computational methods appropriate for the deep quantum regime. We confirm that the transition amplitudes are stable against such refinement. We find that the average boundary geometry does not change, but the new degrees of freedom correct the quantum fluctuations of the boundary and the correlations between spatial patches. The expectation values are compatible with their geometrical interpretation and the correlations between neighboring patches decay when computed across different spinfoam vertices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTime-varying parameter (TVP) regression models can involve a huge number of coefficients. Careful prior elicitation is required to yield sensible posterior and predictive inferences. In addition, the computational demands of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods mean their use is limited to the case where the number of predictors is not too large. In light of these two concerns, this paper proposes a new dynamic shrinkage prior which reflects the empirical regularity that TVPs are typically sparse (i.e. time variation may occur only episodically and only for some of the coefficients). A scalable MCMC algorithm is developed which is capable of handling very high dimensional TVP regressions or TVP Vector Autoregressions. In an exercise using artificial data we demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our methods. In an application involving the term structure of interest rates in the eurozone, we find our dynamic shrinkage prior to effectively pick out small amounts of parameter change and our methods to forecast well.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nStandard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods struggle to explore distributions that concentrate in the neighbourhood of low-dimensional submanifolds. This pathology naturally occurs in Bayesian inference settings when there is a high signal-to-noise ratio in the observational data but the model is inherently over-parametrised or nonidentifiable. In this paper, we propose a strategy that transforms the original sampling problem into the task of exploring a distribution supported on a manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space; in contrast to the original posterior this lifted distribution remains diffuse in the limit of vanishing observation noise. We employ a constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, which exploits the geometry of this lifted distribution, to perform efficient approximate inference. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that, contrarily to competing approaches, the sampling efficiency of our proposed methodology does not degenerate as the target distribution to be explored concentrates near low-dimensional submanifolds.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nKnowledge of stellar atmospheric parameters (T\neff, \n\n\n\n\nlog\ng\n\n\n, [Fe/H]) of M dwarfs can be used to constrain both theoretical stellar models and Galactic chemical evolutionary models, and guide exoplanet searches, but their determination is difficult due to the complexity of the spectra of their cool atmospheres. In our ongoing effort to characterize M dwarfs, and in particular their chemical composition, we carried out multiband photometric calibrations of metallicity for early- and intermediate-type M dwarfs. The third Gaia data release provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry. This information, combined with the 2MASS and CatWISE2020 infrared photometric surveys and a sample of 4919 M dwarfs with metallicity values determined with high-resolution spectroscopy by The Cannon and APOGEE spectra, allowed us to study the effect of the metallicity in color–color and color–magnitude diagrams. We divided this sample into two subsamples: we used 1000 stars to train the calibrations with Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, and the remaining 3919 stars to check the accuracy of the estimations. We derived several photometric calibrations of metallicity applicable to M dwarfs in the range of −0.45 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ + 0.45 dex and spectral types down to M5.0 V that yield uncertainties down to the 0.10 dex level. Lastly, we compared our results with other photometric estimations published in the literature for an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars and found a great predictive performance.",

        "abstract": "The model selection stage has become a central theme in applying the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model to determine the optimal number of bilinear components to be retained to describe the genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI). In the Bayesian context, this problem has been addressed by using information criteria and the Bayes factor. However, these procedures are computationally intensive, making their application unfeasible when the model’s parametric space is large. A Bayesian analysis of the AMMI model was conducted using the Reversible Jump algorithm (RJMCMC) to determine the number of multiplicative terms needed to explain the GEI pattern. Three a priori distributions were assigned for the singular value scale parameter under different justifications, namely: i) the insufficient reason principle (uniform); ii) the invariance principle (Jeffreys’ prior) and iii) the maximum entropy principle. Simulated and real data were used to exemplify the method. An evaluation of the predictive ability of models for simulated data was conducted and indicated that the AMMI analysis, in general, was robust, and models adjusted by the Reversible Jump method were superior to those in which sampling was performed only by the Gibbs sampler. In addition, the RJMCMC showed greater feasibility since the selection and estimation of parameters are carried out concurrently in the same sampling algorithm, being more attractive in terms of computational time. The use of the maximum entropy principle makes the analysis more flexible, avoiding the use of procedures for correcting prior degrees of freedom and obtaining improper posterior marginal distributions.",

        "abstract": "The establishment of managerial approaches for the sustainable use of fishery resources depends on a critical understanding of the stock status. The Monte Carlo catch maximum sustainable yield (CMSY) method and a Bayesian state–space implementation of the Schaefer model (BSM) are recent, but widely used, stock assessment methods for data-limited situations. Here, CMSY and BSM were used to evaluate the state and exploitation level of the seabream population. Collections of catch and effort data from 1988 to 2021, pertaining to time series, were obtained from the Fishery Statistics Book published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources of Oman. The CMSY and BSM results were similar, indicating that the seabream stock of Oman was overfished, as B/BMSY = 0.96 (<1) and F/FMSY = 1.25 (>1). The probability that the stock was being overfished and undergoing overfishing in 2021 was 53%, while the probability that the stock was healthy (high biomass and low fishing pressure) was only 16.2%, when the target should be higher than 75%. The conclusions are of a preliminary nature owing to the utilization of comparatively new methodologies employed to generate them, which commonly validate the condition and utilization of the populations under investigation. Our research suggests that the seabream population in Oman is overfished, and reducing fishing activity is necessary to restore its abundance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nQuasi-periodic pulsation (QPP) is a common phenomenon in solar flares. Studying QPP is important to further our understanding of the physical processes operating in flares. However, detection of QPP is complicated by the presence of noise in flaring lightcurves. In this study, we apply the Bayesian-based Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) technique to the QPP detection. We use MCMC to fit the Fourier power spectral density (PSD) profiles of flaring lightcurves, aiming to determine a quasi-periodic component by model comparison and test statistics. Two models fitting the PSD were compared: the first model consists of colored and white noise only, and the second model adds a spectral peak of a Gaussian shape representing a short-living oscillatory signal. To evaluate MCMC of the QPP detection, we test it on 100 synthetic signals with spectral properties similar to those observed in flares. Subsequently, we analyzed QPP events in 699 flare signals in the 1–8 Å channel recorded by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite from 2010 to 2017, including 250 B-class, 250 C-class, 150 M-class, and 49 X-class flares. Approximately 57% X-class, 39% M-class, 20% C-class, and 16% B-class flares are found to show a strong evidence of QPP, whose periods range mainly from 6.2 to 75.3 s. The results demonstrate that QPP events are easier to detect in more powerful flares. The distribution of the detected QPP periods is found to follow a logarithmic normal distribution. The distributions in the four flare classes are similar. This suggests that the established distribution is a common feature for flares of different classes.",

In particular, we have developed an in-house Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to exhaustively explore the UTZ’s viable parameter space, considering both leading- and next-to-leading contributions in the model’s effective operator product expansion. We also extract – for the first time – reliable UTZ predictions for the (poorly constrained) leptonic CP-violating phases, and ratio observables that characterize neutrino masses probed by (e.g.) oscillation, $$\\beta $$\nβ\n-decay, and cosmological processes. We therefore dramatically improve on the proof-in-principle phenomenological analysis originally presented in [1], and ultimately show that the UTZ remains a minimal, viable, and appealing theory of flavour. Our results also further demonstrate the potential of robustly examining multi-parameter flavour models with MCMC routines.",

        "abstract": " The reservoir brittleness index can characterize the relative brittleness of shale oil and gas reservoirs, which provides guidance for hydraulic fracturing in the later stage of oil and gas exploration and development. It is a significant index to evaluate the sweet spot of oil and gas reservoirs. Most research on the brittleness index involves laboratory measurements and petrophysical quantitative analysis, but few studies directly predict the reservoir brittleness index from prestack seismic data. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) probabilistic algorithm incorporating the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) strategy has been developed to invert the reservoir brittleness index directly. The different brittleness indexes are analyzed and compared by using the constructed rock-physics model of the shale gas exploration area to select the most sensitive one. Based on the chosen brittleness index, the approximate equation of the PP-wave reflection coefficient for the brittleness index is deduced, and the correctness and achievability of the modeling operator are indicated by theoretical analysis. To analyze the uncertainty of the brittleness index and enhance computational efficiency, an improved MCMC probabilistic inversion algorithm is introduced, which aims to optimize the sampling process of the general MCMC algorithm by delayed rejection and adaptive Metropolis strategies. Our study finds that the DRAM strategy improves the efficiency of the algorithm by nearly 30%. Synthetic examples and field seismic data verify the applicability and effectiveness of our inversion method. ",

Therefore, researchers widely use it in many fields such as physics, chemistry, and materials science. Meanwhile, the Monte Carlo method is also a very effective statistical simulation method. This method can far surpass ordinary integration in efficiency with guaranteed computational accuracy. Furthermore, the derived kinetic Monte Carlo method can simulate and study dynamics problems.

        "abstract": "Abstract. The processes responsible for methane (CH4) emissions from boreal wetlands are complex; hence, their model representation is complicated by a large number of parameters and parameter uncertainties. The arctic-enabled dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) is one such model that allows quantification and understanding of the natural wetland CH4 fluxes at various scales, ranging from local to regional and global, but with several uncertainties. The model contains detailed descriptions of the CH4 production, oxidation, and transport controlled by several process parameters. Complexities in the underlying environmental processes, warming-driven alternative paths of meteorological phenomena, and changes in hydrological and vegetation conditions highlight the need for a calibrated and optimised version of LPJ-GUESS. In this study, we formulated the parameter calibration as a Bayesian problem, using knowledge of reasonable parameters values as priors. We then used an adaptive Metropolis–Hastings (MH)-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to improve predictions of CH4 emission by LPJ-GUESS and to quantify uncertainties. Application of this method on uncertain parameters allows for a greater search of their posterior distribution, leading to a more complete characterisation of the posterior distribution with a reduced risk of the sample impoverishment that can occur when using other optimisation methods. For assimilation, the analysis used flux measurement data gathered during the period from 2005 to 2014 from the Siikaneva wetlands in Southern Finland with an estimation of measurement uncertainties. The data are used to constrain the processes behind the CH4 dynamics, and the posterior covariance structures are used to explain how the parameters and the processes are related. To further support the conclusions, the CH4 flux and the other component fluxes associated with the flux are examined. The results demonstrate the robustness of MCMC methods to quantitatively assess the interrelationship between objective function choices, parameter identifiability, and data support. The experiment using real observations from Siikaneva resulted in a reduction in the root-mean-square error (RMSE), from 0.044 to 0.023 gC m−2 d−1, and a 93.89 % reduction in the cost function value. As a part of this work, knowledge about how CH4 data can constrain the parameters and processes is derived. Although the optimisation is performed based on a single site's flux data from Siikaneva, the algorithm is useful for larger-scale multi-site studies for a more robust calibration of LPJ-GUESS and similar models, and the results can highlight where model improvements are needed.\n                    ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMotivation\nA single gene may yield several isoforms with different functions through alternative splicing. Continuous efforts are devoted to developing machine-learning methods to predict isoform functions. However, existing methods do not consider the relevance of each feature to specific functions and ignore the noise caused by the irrelevant features. In this case, we hypothesize that constructing a feature selection framework to extract the function-relevant features might help improve the model accuracy in isoform function prediction.\n\n\nResults\nIn this article, we present a feature selection-based approach named IsoFrog to predict isoform functions. First, IsoFrog adopts a reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)-based feature selection framework to assess the feature importance to gene functions. Second, a sequential feature selection procedure is applied to select a subset of function-relevant features. This strategy screens the relevant features for the specific function while eliminating irrelevant ones, improving the effectiveness of the input features. Then, the selected features are input into our proposed method modified domain-invariant partial least squares, which prioritizes the most likely positive isoform for each positive MIG and utilizes diPLS for isoform function prediction. Tested on three datasets, our method achieves superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods, and the RJMCMC-based feature selection framework outperforms three classic feature selection methods. We expect this proposed methodology will promote the identification of isoform functions and further inspire the development of new methods.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nIsoFrog is freely available at https://github.com/genemine/IsoFrog.\n",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveMuch of psychological research has suffered from small sample sizes and low statistical power, resulting in unstable parameter estimates. The Bayesian approach offers a promising solution by incorporating prior knowledge into statistical models, which may lead to improved stability compared to a frequentist approach.MethodsSimulated data from four populations with known bivariate correlations (ρ = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) was used to estimate the sample correlation as samples were sequentially added from the population, from n = 10 to n = 500. The impact of three different, subjectively defined prior distributions (weakly, moderately, and highly informative) was investigated and compared to a frequentist model.ResultsThe results show that bivariate correlation estimates are unstable, and that the risk of obtaining an estimate that is exaggerated or in the wrong direction is relatively high, for sample sizes for below 100, and considerably so for sample sizes below 50. However, this instability can be constrained by informative Bayesian priors.ConclusionInformative Bayesian priors have the potential to significantly reduce sample size requirements and help ensure that obtained estimates are in line with realistic expectations. The combined stabilizing and regularizing effect of a weakly informative prior is particularly useful when conducting research with small samples. The impact of more informative Bayesian priors depends on one’s threshold for probability and whether one’s goal is to obtain an estimate merely in the correct direction, or to obtain a high precision estimate whose associated interval falls within a narrow range. Implications for sample size requirements and directions for future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian network model, which combines the dynamic Bayesian network and the multi-change point process, solves the limitations of the dynamic Bayesian network in modeling non-stationary gene expression data to a certain extent. However, certain problems persist, such as the low network reconstruction accuracy and poor model convergence. Therefore, we propose an MD-birth move based on the Manhattan distance of the data points to increase the rationality of the multi-change point process. The underlying concept of the MD-birth move is that the direction of movement of the change point is assumed to have a larger Manhattan distance between the variance and the mean of its left and right data points. Considering the data instability characteristics, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method based on node-dependent particle filtering in addition to the multi-change point process. The candidate parent nodes to be sampled, which are close to the real state, are pushed to the high probability area through the particle filter, and the candidate parent node set to be sampled that is far from the real state is pushed to the low probability area and then sampled. In terms of reconstructing the gene regulatory network, the model proposed in this paper (FC-DBN) has better network reconstruction accuracy and model convergence speed than other corresponding models on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and RAF data.",

Another way to increase efficiency is to utilize the increased computational speed by applying GPUs to highly parallelisable finance problems such as calculating Greeks. We pair QMC-CPW with simulation on the GPU using the CUDA platform. We estimate the delta, vega and gamma Greeks of three exotic options: arithmetic Asian, binary Asian, and look-back.

        "abstract": "Abstract. Stochastic models in hydrology are very useful and widespread tools for making reliable probabilistic predictions. However, such models are only accurate at making predictions if model parameters are first of all calibrated to measured data in a consistent framework such as the Bayesian one, in which knowledge about model parameters is described through probability distributions. Unfortunately, Bayesian parameter calibration, a. k. a. inference, with stochastic models, is often a computationally intractable problem with traditional inference algorithms, such as the Metropolis algorithm, due to the expensive likelihood functions. Therefore, the prohibitive computational cost is often overcome by employing over-simplified error models, which leads to biased parameter estimates and unreliable predictions. However, thanks to recent advancements in algorithms and computing power, fully fledged Bayesian inference with stochastic models is no longer off-limits for hydrological applications.\nOur goal in this work is to demonstrate that a computationally efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with a timescale separation makes Bayesian parameter inference with stochastic models feasible. Hydrology can potentially take great advantage of this powerful data-driven inference method as a sound calibration of model parameters is essential for making robust probabilistic predictions, which can certainly be useful in planning and policy-making. We demonstrate the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo approach by detailing a case study from urban hydrology. Discussing specific hydrological models or systems is outside the scope of our present work and will be the focus of further studies.\n                    ",

        "abstract": "AbstractWe consider the problem of estimating expectations with respect to a target distribution with an unknown normalising constant, and where even the un-normalised target needs to be approximated at finite resolution. This setting is ubiquitous across science and engineering applications, for example in the context of Bayesian inference where a physics-based model governed by an intractable partial differential equation (PDE) appears in the likelihood. A multi-index sequential Monte Carlo (MISMC) method is used to construct ratio estimators which provably enjoy the complexity improvements of multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC) as well as the efficiency of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for inference. In particular, the proposed method provably achieves the canonical complexity of $$\\hbox {MSE}^{-1}$$\n\nMSE\n\n-\n1\n\n\n, while single-level methods require $$\\hbox {MSE}^{-\\xi }$$\n\nMSE\n\n-\nξ\n\n\n for $$\\xi >1$$\n\nξ\n>\n1\n\n. This is illustrated on examples of Bayesian inverse problems with an elliptic PDE forward model in 1 and 2 spatial dimensions, where $$\\xi =5/4$$\n\nξ\n=\n5\n/\n4\n\n and $$\\xi =3/2$$\n\nξ\n=\n3\n/\n2\n\n, respectively. It is also illustrated on more challenging log-Gaussian process models, where single-level complexity is approximately $$\\xi =9/4$$\n\nξ\n=\n9\n/\n4\n\n and multilevel Monte Carlo (or MIMC with an inappropriate index set) gives $$\\xi = 5/4 + \\omega $$\n\nξ\n=\n5\n/\n4\n+\nω\n\n, for any $$\\omega > 0$$\n\nω\n>\n0\n\n, whereas our method is again canonical. We also provide novel theoretical verification of the product-form convergence results which MIMC requires for Gaussian processes built in spaces of mixed regularity defined in the spectral domain, which facilitates acceleration with fast Fourier transform methods via a cumulant embedding strategy, and may be of independent interest in the context of spatial statistics and machine learning.",

The purpose of this study is to find out how the results of the application and comparison of the accuracy of the WMC method and the FTS-MC method on weekly air temperature prediction in Banda Aceh City. The prediction result of air temperature in Banda Aceh city using the WMC method for the next three weeks obtained an air temperature of 26,5℃.

The MAPE accuracy level of the WMC method is 1,5% and the FTS-MC method is 1,7%. This shows that the MAPE of the WMC method is smaller than the FTS-MC method so it can be concluded that air temperature prediction using the WMC method is better than the FTS-MC method.",

        "abstract": "There is currently no widely accepted standard method to determine whether gerrymandering has occurred. To determine a cutoff for unreasonable gerrymandering, simulating collections of districting plans in the absence of partisan bias has been proposed. In simulation-based methods, real-world election outcomes are compared to results from simulated districting plans. Here, a simulation method that creates possible districts in continuous space is proposed. Existing methods use preliminary spatial discretization of the state to perform simulations. This spatial discretization can result in biased estimates, which could lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding gerrymandering. We use our continuous-space method to analyze the political districts in Pennsylvania. All of our simulated elections result in fewer than 13 Republican seats, indicating that the districting plan used in Pennsylvania prior to 2018 was likely gerrymandered. This finding agrees with and confirms the results of simulation-based discrete-space gerrymandering studies without the presence of discretization bias.",

        "abstract": "Most statistical methods require likelihood evaluation to draw a statistical inference. However, in some situations, likelihood evaluation becomes difficult analytically or computationally.  Different likelihood-free methods are available that eliminate the need to compute the likelihood function. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework that implements likelihood-free inference and replaces the likelihood evaluation with simulations by using forward modeling. The goal of ABC methods is to approximate the posterior distribution. However, posterior approximation via ABC methods is still considerably expensive for high dimensions. ABC requires many simulations that become computationally infeasible for complex models. Here, a technique is proposed that combines a somewhat more efficient form of ABC (Population Monte Carlo, PMC) with a Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) approach. The proposed framework provides an estimation of the posterior distribution which is referred to as PMC-CDE. A simulation study is performed that provides empirical evidence to show the efficiency of PMC-CDE in terms of integrated squared error loss. Furthermore, real-life datasets manifest the application of the proposed method.",

This condition is exacerbated if simplifying hypotheses like isotropy are discarded in favor of more realistic anisotropic models that, although supported by seismological evidence, require more free parameters. Investigating the connections between underdetermination and anisotropy requires the implementation of solvers which explore the whole family of possibilities behind nonuniqueness and allow for more informed conclusions about the interpretation of the seismic models. Because these aspects cannot be investigated using traditional iterative linearized inversion schemes with regularization constraints that collapse the infinite possible models into a unique solution, we explore the application of transdimensional Bayesian Monte Carlo sampling to address the consequences of underdetermination in anisotropic seismic imaging. We show how teleseismic waves of P and S phases can constrain upper-mantle anisotropy and the amount of additional information these data provide in terms of uncertainty and trade-offs among multiple fields.",

The applicability of the proposed model is evaluated through a real-life case study of a multinational sporting goods retailer with sensitivity analysis. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulation is used to capture the demand uncertainty and test the robustness of the model.\nResults: The minimized cost is achieved with optimal facility locations and product flows. The optimal result shows a 3% reduction in the total cost, making it the most robust solution under demand uncertainty.\nLimitations of the investigation: The proposed model is only applicable to a single-commodity supply chain network. In addition, the cost components of the network are limited to facility costs and transportation costs, disregarding the other cost components.\nPractical implications: This research demonstrates a methodology that can be used as a decision support system by managers to make strategic and tactical decisions in a supply chain network when demand is uncertain.\nOriginality / Value: The MILP and simulation techniques used together to construct a three-tiered supply chain under uncertainty receive little attention in the literature. In addition to developing a novel three-echelon MILP model, this research makes use of a real-world case study to illustrate the methodology's performance in the context of demand uncertainty through simulation.",

        "abstract": "Conformance monitoring supports UTM safety by observing if unmanned aircraft (UA) are adhering to declared operational intent. As a supporting system, robust cooperative tracking is critical. Nevertheless, tracking systems for UAS traffic management (UTM) are in an early stage and under-standardized, and existing literature hardly addresses the problem. To bridge this gap, this study aims to probabilistically evaluate the impact of the change in tracking performances on the effectiveness of conformance monitoring. We propose a Monte Carlo simulation-based method. To ensure a realistic simulation environment, we use a hybrid software-in-the-loop (SITL) scheme. The major uncertainties contributing to the stochastic evaluation are measured separately and are integrated into the final Monte Carlo simulation. Latency tests were conducted to assess the performance of different communication technologies for cooperative tracking. Flight technical error generation via SITL simulations and navigational system error generation based on flight experiments were employed to model UA trajectory uncertainty. Based on these tests, further Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the overall impacts of various tracking key performance indicators in UTM conformance monitoring. Results suggest that the extrapolation of UA position enables quicker non-conformance detection, but introduces greater variability in detection delay, and exacerbates the incidence of nuisance alerts and missed detections, particularly when latencies are high and velocity errors are severe. Recommendations for UA position update rates of ≥1 Hz remain consistent with previous studies, as investments in increasing the update rate do not lead to corresponding improvements in conformance monitoring performance according to simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Rainfall is considered one of the most important weather parameters which helps in deciding the time of sowing, pest and disease management and harvesting. Markov chain analysis deals with predicting future values based on past values. In the present study, Markov Chain analysis was used to predict the future probability of monthly rainfall and examine the pattern and distribution of rainfall using daily rainfall data from the year 1982 to 2016 (34 years) in the Coimbatore district. This study mainly analysed the probability of rainfall in the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu based on Markov chain process. Based on the National Center for Hydrology and Meteorology, the intensity of rainfall per day was categorized and a day is considered as no rain if rainfall was less than 0.1 mm, low rain if rainfall was between 0.1 mm to 10 mm, moderate rain if rainfall was between 10 mm to 20 mm and heavy rain if rainfall was above 20 mm. By calculating the transition probability matrices and steady-state probability matrices for each month based on the conditional probability of rain on a particular day given that rain on the previous day which is to predict the state of rainfall on the next day. This study reported that the availability of water for crop production is higher during the winter, pre-monsoon, the onset of the southwest monsoon, and at the end of the northeast monsoon. There may be a scarcity of water from August to November for agricultural activities. Based on this study, farmers can plan for a better cropping system in advance to get a better yield.",

Jasra, K. J. H. Law and F. Yu,\nUnbiased filtering of a class of partially observed diffusions,\nAdv. Appl. Probab.\n54 (2022), 3, 661–687] establishes that, when only having access to the time discretized diffusion, it is possible to remove the discretization bias with an estimator of finite variance.\nWe improve on this method by introducing a modified estimator based on the recent work [A.

Ombao,\nAntithetic multilevel particle filters, preprint (2023), https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12371].\nWe show that this new estimator is unbiased and has finite variance.\nMoreover, we conjecture and verify in numerical simulations that substantial gains are obtained.\nThat is, for a given mean square error (MSE) and a particular class of multi-dimensional diffusion, the cost to achieve the said MSE falls.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis manuscript presents a short route to justify the widely used Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) algorithm straight from the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). In this regard, this paper starts deriving a probability measure obtained from the integral formulation of the RTE under a unidirectional point source in an infinite domain. This derivation only requires the analytical integration of the first two terms of a perturbation expansion. Although derivations have been devised to clarify the relationship between the MCRT and the RTE, they tend to be rather long and elaborate. Considering how simple it is to justify the MCRT from a loose probabilistic interpretation of the photon’s physical propagation process, the decay in popularity of former approaches relating MCRT to the RTE is entirely understandable. Unfortunately, all of this has given the false impression that MCRT and the RTE are not that closely related, to the point that recent works have explicitly stated that no direct link exists between them.\nThis work presents a simpler route demonstrating how the MCRT algorithm emerges to statistically sample the RTE explicitly through Markov chains, further clarifying the method’s foundations.\nAlthough compact, the derivation proposed in this work does not skip any fundamental step, preserving mathematical rigor while giving specific expressions and functions.\nThus, this derivation can help devise efficient ways to statistically sample the RTE for different scenarios or when coupling the MCRT method with other methods traditionally grounded in the RTE, such as the Spherical Harmonics and Discrete Ordinates methods.",

The Web of Science (WoS) database's 1309 scientific studies in which the power of the test was determined by using Monte Carlo simulation techniques served as the study's material of data. The analysis includes the number of studies by year, average citation count by year, the number of articles published in scientific journals, countries of responsible authors, and the most relevant words in the studies. It was observed that Communications in Statistics-Simulation and Computation and Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation are the journals with the highest number of published articles. The United States of America (USA) takes the lead when considering the countries of corresponding authors, while Türkiye is in 8th place. The most used keywords in the ten-year time period of scientific studies were respectively “power”, “test”, “skewness”, “model” and “inference”. As a result, it can be concluded that test power studies can be obtained safely using the Monte Carlo simulation technique.",
