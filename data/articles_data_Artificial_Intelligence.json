Consequently, this chapter defends and further articulates the need for “provably beneficial AI,” which is the idea that to the extent that human values are revealed in our behavior, we should be able to get machines to learn underlying human preferences from observing human behavior. It then discusses the technical challenges involved in building provably beneficial AI and responds to some possible concerns to this approach.",

        "abstract": "Compared to the human brain, current artificial intelligence technology is limited in that its goals are determined by human developers and users. Similarly, despite their superficial similarities, modern-day computers and human brains have many differences. Building blocks of human brain that are functionally equivalent to transistors, functional units of digital computers, have not been identified, and we do not know whether hardware and software are separable in the human brain. This chapter uses Mars rovers as a case study to illustrate the autonomy of intelligent robots, because machines dependent on human intelligence is not genuinely intelligent.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn recent decades, preterm birth (PTB) has become a significant research focus in the healthcare field, as it is a leading cause of neonatal mortality worldwide. Using five independent study cohorts including 1290 vaginal samples from 561 pregnant women who delivered at term (n = 1029) or prematurely (n = 261), we analysed vaginal metagenomics data for precise microbiome structure characterization. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) was trained to predict term birth (TB) and PTB with an accuracy of 84.10% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.875 ± 0.11. During a benchmarking process, we demonstrated that our DL model outperformed seven currently used machine learning algorithms. Finally, our results indicate that overall diversity of the vaginal microbiota should be taken in account to predict PTB and not specific species. This artificial-intelligence based strategy should be highly helpful for clinicians in predicting preterm birth risk, allowing personalized assistance to address various health issues.

        "abstract": "As the militaries of technologically advanced nations seek to apply increasingly sophisticated AI and automation to weapons technologies, a host of ethical, legal, social, and political questions arise. Central among these is whether it is ethical to delegate the decision to use lethal force to an autonomous system that is not under meaningful human control. Further questions arise as to who or what could or should be held responsible when lethal force is used improperly by such systems. This chapter argues that current autonomous weapons are not legal or moral agents that can be held morally responsible or legally accountable for their choices and actions, and that therefore humans need to maintain control over such weapons systems.",

Innovation activity is mushrooming and hence innovative history is an ever growing data accumulation. AIAI identified a universal innovation map, which is processed like the tape in a Turing machine, only here in the Innovation Turing machine, marking an innovation pathway. By mapping innovative history onto these maps, one enables the growing record of innovation history to guide current innovation as to merit, expected cost, estimated duration, etc. Using Monte Carlo and Discriminant Analysis, an Artificial Innovation Assistant runs a dialog with the human innovator with a net effect of accelerated innovation. Users of AIAI are expected to exhibit a commanding lead over innovators guided only by their creativity.",

This chapter sketches a theory of moral status and considers what kind of moral status an AI could have. Among other things, the chapter argues that AIs that are alive, conscious, or sentient, or those that can feel pain, have desires, and have rational or moral agency should have the same kind of moral status as entities that have the same kind of intrinsic properties. It also proposes that a sufficient condition for an AI to have human-level moral status and be a rightsholder is when an AI has the physical basis for moral agency. This chapter also considers what kind of rights a rightsholding AI could have and how AIs could have greater than human-level moral status.",

The chapter proposes a framework for ethical analysis that can be used to facilitate more robust ethical reflection in AI development and implementation. It presents an ethical matrix that incorporates the language of data science as a tool that data scientists can build themselves in order to integrate ethical analysis into the design process, addressing the need for immediate analysis and accountability over the design and deployment of near-term AI.",

        "abstract": "This chapter essentially makes a non-elusive attempt in quest of ‘I’ (Intelligence) in ‘AI’ (Artificial Intelligence). In the year 1950, Alan Turing proposed “the imitation game” which was a gaming problem to make a very fundamental question — “can a machine think?”. The said article of Turing did not provide any tool to measure intelligence but produced a philosophical argument on the issue of intelligence. In 1950, Claude Shannon published a landmark paper on computer chess and rang the bell of the computer era. Over the past decades, there have been huge attempts to define and measure intelligence across the fields of cognitive psychology and AI. We critically appreciate these definitions and evaluation approaches in quest of intelligence, which can mimic the cognitive abilities of human intelligence. We arrive at the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (C–H–C) concept, which is a three-stratum theory for intelligence. The C–H–C theory of intelligence can be crudely approximated by deep meta-learning approach to integrate the representation power of deep learning into meta-learning. Thus we can combine crystallized intelligence with fluid intelligence, as they complement each other for robust learning, reasoning, and problem-solving in a generalized setup which can be a benchmark for flexible AI and eventually general AI. In far-reaching future to search for human-like intelligence in general AI, we may explore neuromorphic computing which is essentially based on biological neurons.",

Each transaction in the records is approved and verified by consensus of the participants in the system that requires solving a hard mathematical puzzle, which is known as proof-of-work. To make the approved records immutable, the mathematical puzzle is not trivial to solve and therefore consumes substantial computing resources. However, it is energy-wasteful to have many computational nodes installed in the blockchain competing to approve the records by just solving a meaningless puzzle. Here, we pose proof-of-work as a reinforcementlearning problem by modeling the blockchain growing as a Markov decision process, in which a learning agent makes an optimal decision over the environment’s state, whereas a new block is added and verified. Specifically, we design the block verification and consensus mechanism as a deep reinforcement-learning iteration process. As a result, our method utilizes the determination of state transition and the randomness of action selection of a Markov decision process, as well as the computational complexity of a deep neural network, collectively to make the blocks not easy to recompute and to preserve the order of transactions, while the blockchain nodes are exploited to train the same deep neural network with different data samples (state-action pairs) in parallel, allowing the model to experience multiple episodes across computing nodes but at one time. Our method is used to design the next generation of public blockchain networks, which has the potential not only to spare computational resources for industrial applications but also to encourage data sharing and AI model design for common problems.",

        "abstract": "Following the analysis given by Alan Turing in 1951, one must expect that AI capabilities will eventually exceed those of humans across a wide range of real-world-decision making scenarios. Should this be a cause for concern, as Turing, Hawking, and others have suggested? And, if so, what can we do about it? While some in the mainstream AI community dismiss the issue, I will argue that the problem is real: we have to work out how to design AI systems that are far more powerful than ourselves while ensuring that they never have power over us. I believe the technical aspects of this problem are solvable. Whereas the standard model of AI proposes to build machines that optimize known, exogenously specified objectives, a preferable approach would be to build machines that are of provable benefit to humans. I introduce assistance games as a formal class of problems whose solution, under certain assumptions, has the desired property.",

It has the skill to operate as a machine and simulate various human intelligent algorithms according to the user’s choice. It has the ability to solve problems, act like humans, and perceive information. In the current scenario, intelligent techniques minimize human effort especially in industrial fields. Human beings create machines through these intelligent techniques and perform various processes in different fields. Artificial intelligence deals with real-time insights where decisions are made by connecting the data to various resources. To solve real-time problems, powerful machine learning-based techniques such as artificial intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and particle swarm optimization have been used in recent years. This chapter explains artificial neural network-based adaptive linear neuron networks, back-propagation networks, and radial basis networks.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) is bringing tremendous new opportunities and challenges to geospatial research. Its fast development is powered by theoretical advancement, big data, computer hardware (e.g., the graphics processing unit, or GPU), and high-performance computing platforms that support the development, training, and deployment of AI models within a reasonable amount of time. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which is the integration of geospatial studies and AI, especially machine learning and deep learning methods and the latest AI technologies in both academia and industry. GeoAI can be regarded as a study subject to develop intelligent computer programs to mimic the processes of human perception, spatial reasoning, and discovery about geographical phenomena and dynamics; to advance our knowledge; and to solve problems in human environmental systems and their interactions, with a focus on spatial contexts and roots in geography or geographic information science (GIScience). Thus, it would require the knowledge of AI theory, programming and computation practices as well as geographic domain knowledge to be competent in GeoAI research. There have already been increasingly collaborative GeoAI studies for GIScience, remote sensing, physical environment, and human society. It is a good time to provide a key reference list for educators, students, researchers, and practitioners to keep up with the latest GeoAI research topics. This bibliographical entry will first review the historical roots for AI in geography and GIScience and then list up to ten selective recent works with annotations that briefly describe their importance for each topic of interest in the GeoAI landscape, ranging from fundamental spatial representation learning to spatial predictions and to various advancements in cartography, earth observation, social sensing, and geospatial semantics.",
