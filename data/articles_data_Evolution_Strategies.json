        "abstract": "This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature concerning the co-evolution of chooser preferences and courter traits. It begins by summarizing the simplest scenario for coevolution between traits and preferences. It then reviews the evidence for genetic covariance between traits and preference. The remainder of the chapter discusses adaptive coevolution, mode of transmission and preference-trait coevolution, the limits of indirect selection, compatibility and epistasis, mate choice as an agent of trait evolution, population-level consequences of mate choice, and coevolution of multiple traits and preferences. It suggests that the contribution of good genes, and additive indirect benefits more generally, may be quite small relative to other forms of selection on preference.",

        "abstract": "Viruses, the simplest organisms, obligate parasites that encode structural proteins and replicative functions requiring the cellular machinery of the host to ensure their propagation. Viruses are masters of evolution. An analysis of infectious diseases emerging since the 1980s revealed that most were caused by viruses, especially those with RNA genomes. New viral emergences are generally the result of intrinsic changes in the genetics of the virus to increase transmission, virulence or host range, and environmental or ecological changes that favor contacts between viruses and humans or other hosts. We describe the molecular mechanisms of viruses that ensure their rapid adaptation and evolution. We describe instances where viral evolution appears partially responsible for recent outbreaks and discuss the challenges in identifying the cause or consequence of viral evolution in the context of resource-rich versus -limited countries.",

        "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between learning styles and the teaching-learning process in university students of Primary Education, utilizing the Felder and Silverman model. A descriptive and statistical analysis of learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) among 157 students was conducted using Google Forms surveys and SPSS analysis. The results show a predominance of the visual style, suggesting that teaching methods commonly used by faculty may have influenced the modification of students' Learning Styles to include more visual resources. The absence of the kinesthetic style is discussed, thus raising the hypothesis to be tested in ongoing studies that traditional educational methodology may influence the evolution of learning styles. This study highlights the importance of recognizing and adapting teaching strategies to predominant learning styles to enhance the effectiveness of the educational process. The findings suggest the need to integrate more visual resources into teaching while considering the variability and potential evolution of learning styles due to the educational methodology employed.",

        "abstract": "Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is a key concept in evolutionary game theory. ESS provides an evolutionary stability criterion for biological, social and economical behaviors. In this paper, we develop a new approach to evaluate ESS in symmetric two player games with fuzzy payoffs. Particularly, every strategy is assigned a fuzzy membership that describes to what degree it is an ESS in presence of uncertainty. The fuzzy set of ESS characterize the nature of ESS. The proposed approach avoids loss of any information that happens by the defuzzification method in games and handles uncertainty of payoffs through all steps of finding an ESS. We use the satisfaction function to compare fuzzy payoffs, and adopts the fuzzy decision rule to obtain the membership function of the fuzzy set of ESS. The theorem shows the relation between fuzzy ESS and fuzzy Nash equilibrium. The numerical results illustrate the proposed method is an appropriate generalization of ESS to fuzzy payoff games.",

Blessed with higher order cognitive abilities, we are able to avail ourselves of an array of complex strategies that we can tailor to strategies invoked by others during the give and take of social exchanges. Although we may inherit genes that incline us to invoke different strategies from those who inherit different genes, the strategies that we end up invoking are affected by a wide array of developmental, environmental, and cultural factors. The laws of evolution do not imply that all evolved strategies are adaptive in modern environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe evolution of sexual reproduction has perplexed biologists for decades. The earliest organisms on Earth could replicate by themselves, so why do almost all multicellular species combine their genetic material with other individuals to reproduce? After all, asexual reproduction was very successful for well over a billion years. It remains the only mode of reproduction in all of today’s bacteria and is used by many multicellular organisms at certain times in their lifecycle. Sex is costly. It is characterized by increased time and energy at the cellular and organismal levels, may result in injury or even death, and exposes individuals to predators and parasites. Conversely, it can repair damaged stretches of DNA and create the variability necessary for natural selection. Furthermore, assuming that there is some benefit to reproducing sexually, why are sex partners so different? Given that the objective of both individuals is to optimize the production of high-quality progeny, one would expect all members of a species to be similar. Instead, the two types of individuals we denote as biological males and females often exhibit an array of anatomical and behavioural differences that may influence their approach to sexual encounters. Interactions between the two can be co-operative, but their unique strategies often reveal an underlying conflict. This book explores the possible reasons why sex evolved, examines how the differences between males and females arose, and discusses how those differences affect their reproductive strategies.",

Modelling replication as an active computational process opens up many degrees of freedom that are exploited to meet environmental challenges, and to modify the evolutionary process itself. Here we use automata chemistry models and spatial RNA world models to study the emergence of parasitism and the complexity that evolves in response. The system is initialised with a hand-designed replicator that copies other replicators with a small chance of point mutation. Almost immediately, short parasites arise; these are copied more quickly, and so have an evolutionary advantage. The replicators also become shorter, and so are replicated faster; they evolve a mechanism to slow down replication, which reduces the difference of replication rate of replicators and parasites. They also evolve explicit mechanisms to discriminate copies of self from parasites; these mechanisms become increasingly complex. New parasite species continually arise from mutated replicators, rather than from evolving parasite lineages. Evolution itself evolves, eg by effectively increasing point mutation rates, and by generating novel emergent mutational operators. Thus, parasitism drives the evolution of complex replicators and complex ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractUnderstanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is a fundamental problem. Many theoretical approaches have been investigating ecological interactions, such as competition, as potential drivers of diversification. Classical consumer-resource models predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of distinct resources, a phenomenon known as the competitive exclusion principle. It has recently been argued that including physiological tradeoffs in consumer-resource models can lead to violations of this principle and to ecological coexistence of very high numbers of species. Here we show that these results crucially depend on the functional form of the tradeoff. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of resource use constrained by tradeoffs and show that if the tradeoffs are non-linear, the system either does not diversify, or diversifies into a number of coexisting species that does not exceed the number of resources. In particular, very high diversity can only be observed for linear tradeoffs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBet-hedging strategies, such as dispersal and dormancy, are predicted to evolve in varying and uncertain environments and are critical to ecological models of biodiversity maintenance. Theories of the specific ecological scenarios that favor the evolution of dispersal, dormancy, or their covariance are rarely tested, particularly for naturally-evolved populations that experience complex patterns of spatiotemporal environmental variation. We grew 23 populations of Vulpia microstachys, an annual grass native to California, in a greenhouse, and on the offspring generation measured seed dispersal ability and dormancy rates. We hypothesized that seed dormancy rates and dispersal abilities would be highest in populations from more productive, temporally variable sites, causing them to covary positively. Contrary to our hypothesis, our data suggest that both dispersal and dormancy evolve to combat different axes and scales of spatial heterogeneity, and are underlain by different seed traits, allowing them to evolve independently. Dormancy appears to have evolved as a strategy for overcoming microgeographic heterogeneity rather than temporal climate fluctuations, an outcome that to our knowledge has not been considered by theory. In sum, we provide much needed empirical data on the evolution of bet hedging, as well as a new perspective on the ecological function dormancy provides in heterogeneous landscapes.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDirected evolution can enable engineering of biological systems with minimal knowledge of their underlying sequence-to-function relationships. A typical directed evolution process consists of iterative rounds of mutagenesis and selection that are designed to steer changes in a biological system (e.g. a protein) towards some functional goal. Much work has been done, particularly leveraging advancements in machine learning, to optimise the process of directed evolution. Many of these methods, however, require DNA sequencing and synthesis, making them resource-intensive and incompatible with developments in targetedin vivomutagenesis. Operating within the experimental constraints of established sorting-based directed evolution techniques (e.g. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting, FACS), we explore approaches for optimisation of directed evolution that do not require sequencing information. We then expand our methods to the context of emerging experimental techniques in directed evolution, which allow for single-cell selection based on fitness objectives defined from any combination measurable traits. Finally, we validate the developed selection strategies on the GB1 empirical landscape, demonstrating that they can lead to up to a 7.5 fold increase in the probability of attaining the global fitness peak.Author summaryThe standard approach to sorting-based selection in directed evolution is to take forward only the top-performing variants from each generation of a single population. In this work, we begin to explore alternative selection strategies within a simulated directed evolution framework. We propose “selection functions”, which allow us to tune the balance of exploration and exploitation of a fitness landscape, and we demonstrate that splitting a population into sub-populations can improve both the likelihood and magnitude of a successful outcome. We also propose strategies to leverage emerging selection methods that can implement single-cell selection based on any combination of measurable traits. We validate our optimised directed evolution approaches on the empirical fitness landscape of the GB1 immunoglobulin protein.",

We are increasingly reusing data within our teams and projects and through the global, openly archived datasets of others. Metadata can be challenging to write and interpret, but it is always crucial for reuse. The value metadata cannot be overstated—even as a relatively independent research object because it describes the work that has been done in a structured format. We advance a new perspective and classify methods for metadata curation and development with tables. Tables with templates can be effectively used to capture all components of an experiment or project in a single, easy‐to‐read file familiar to most scientists. If coupled with the R programming language, metadata from tables can then be rapidly and reproducibly converted to publication formats including extensible markup language files suitable for data repositories. Tables can also be used to summarize existing metadata and store metadata across many datasets. A case study is provided and the added benefits of tables for metadata, a priori, are developed to ensure a more streamlined publishing process for many data repositories used in ecology, evolution, and the environmental sciences. In ecology and evolution, researchers are often highly tabular thinkers from experimental data collection in the lab and/or field, and representations of metadata as a table will provide novel research and reuse insights.",

Thus, the costs and benefits for specific individuals must be considered when examining their mating arrangement. However, general environmental conditions may still favour the development of particular mating patterns. True genetic monogamy is probably rare but can be promoted by certain conditions such as a low probability of finding a mate, mate guarding by either sex, or the necessity of parental care by both the male and the female. The clumping of defendable resources needed by females, or by females themselves, makes it more likely that a few males will mate polygynously, or with several females. In many of these cases, however, it is unclear whether females mate with more than one male. In some cases, females are polyandrous and mate with more than one male. Some of the reasons for females copulating with different partners are discussed in the previous chapter. It is becoming increasingly evident that both males and females may employ many reproductive tactics depending on their age, general anatomy, and immediate environment.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAnimals regulate their nutrient consumption to maximize the expression of fitness traits with competing nutritional needs (“nutritional trade‐offs”). Nutritional trade‐offs have been studied using a response surface modeling approach known as the Geometric Framework for nutrition (GF). Current experimental design in GF studies does not explore the entire area of the nutritional space resulting in performance landscapes that may be incomplete. This hampers our ability to understand the properties of the performance landscape (e.g., peak shape) from which meaningful biological insights can be obtained. Here, I tested alternative experimental designs to explore the full range of the performance landscape in GF studies. I compared the performance of the standard GF design strategy with three alternatives: hexagonal, square, and random points grid strategies with respect to their accuracy in reconstructing baseline performance landscapes from a landmark GF dataset. I showed that standard GF design did not reconstruct the properties of baseline performance landscape appropriately particularly for traits that respond strongly to the interaction between nutrients. Moreover, the peak estimates in the reconstructed performance landscape using standard GF design were accurate in terms of the nutrient ratio but incomplete in terms of peak shape. All other grid designs provided more accurate reconstructions of the baseline performance landscape while also providing accurate estimates of nutrient ratio and peak shape. Thus, alternative experimental designs can maximize information from performance landscapes in GF studies, enabling reliable biological insights into nutritional trade‐offs and physiological limits within and across species.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMulticellular organisms can potentially show a large degree of diversity in reproductive strategies, as they could reproduce offspring with varying sizes and compositions compared to their unicellular ancestors. In reality, only a few of these reproductive strategies are prevalent. To understand why this could be the case, we develop a stage-structured population model to probe the evolutionary growth advantages of reproductive strategies in incipient multicellular organisms. The performance of reproductive strategies is evaluated by the growth rates of corresponding populations. We identify the optimal reproductive strategy, which leads to the largest growth rate for a population. Considering the effects of organism size and cellular interaction, we found that distinct reproductive strategies could perform uniquely or equally well under different conditions. Only binary-splitting reproductive strategies can be uniquely optimal. Our results show that organism size and cellular interaction can play crucial roles in shaping reproductive strategies in nascent multicellularity. Our model sheds light on understanding the mechanism driving the evolution of reproductive strategies in incipient multicellularity. Meanwhile, beyond multicellularity, our results imply a crucial factor in the evolution of reproductive strategies of unicellular species - organism size.",

I discuss the local theory of the one-step expected progress and success probability for the (1+1) ES with a normal/uniform distribution inside the sphere mutation, thereby minimizing the SPHERE function, but also the adjacent global convergence and convergence rate theory, essentially based on the 1/5 rule.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAsexual reproduction faces a few drawbacks. The most important of these are the accumulation of deleterious mutations and the lack of variability between individuals in a population. Both problems are partially offset in prokaryotes, where transformation, conjugation, and transduction make it possible to use parts of the chromosome of another individual to repair its own and add variability to the genome. However, sexual reproduction addresses both disadvantages more fully, and addressing one or both may have been influential in its evolution. Combining genes with those of another individual during reproduction results in access to genetic material that can also be used to repair, or at least mask, DNA damage or deleterious mutations. Additionally, sexual reproduction results in variable young. This variability is due to crossing-over and the random segregation of chromosomes during the formation of gametes and combining the genes of two individuals. Recent studies have focussed on the Red Queen hypothesis, which states that having offspring genetically different from their mother makes them less susceptible to parasites. A short life cycle enables these parasites to adapt well to their hosts. Offspring can better combat pathogens tailored to their mother by being a little different.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMales and females have differing strategies when it comes to maximizing their fitness. In general, males are limited by the availability of receptive females, while females are constrained by the number of offspring they can produce. However, their availability for reproduction largely determines which sex competes and which is most selective about their breeding partner. Typically, the sex that requires more time to go through one reproductive cycle (thus being unavailable for breeding) is the sex that invests more in reproduction; correspondingly, they tend to be choosiest. Alternatively, the sex available to breed for more time typically invests less in offspring and competes for members of the opposite sex. Thus, while males usually compete for choosy females, the opposite may be true, or both sexes may be choosy. When competing, indirect means (e.g. finding mates, sexual endurance) and direct interactions (fighting) may result in selection for different characteristics. ‘Intrasexual selection’, often used interchangeably with ‘female choice’, has been used to explain the evolution of elaborate male traits. Runaway selection, the handicap principle, parasite resistance, and mitonuclear compatibility have all been proposed as hypotheses for intrasexual selection. Current evidence suggests choosing high-quality mates may be based on parasite resistance or overall energy levels.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLife history theory indicates that individuals/species with a slow pace of life invest more in acquired than innate immunity. Factors that decrease the pace of life and predict greater investment in acquired immunity include increased nutritional resources, increased pathogen exposure and decreased risk of extrinsic mortality. Common care behaviors given to sick individuals produce exactly these effects: provisioning increases nutritional resources; hygiene assistance increases disease exposure of carers; and protection can reduce the risk of extrinsic mortality to sick individuals. This study, therefore, investigated under what conditions care giving behaviors might impact immune strategy and pace of life. The study employed an agent-based model approach that simulated populations with varying levels of care giving, disease mortality, disease transmissibility, and extrinsic mortality, enabling measurements of how the immune strategy and age structure of the populations changed over evolutionary time. We used multiple regressions to examine the effects of these variables on immune strategy and the age structure of the population. The findings supported our predictions that care was selected for an acquired immunity. However, the pace of life did not slow as expected. Instead, the population shifted to a faster, but also more cost-intensive reproductive strategy in which care improved child survival by subsidizing the development of acquired immune responses.",

These dissimilarities mean males and females are under different selective forces when optimizing their fitness. Typically, gene-promoting tactics employed by one sex conflict with the other. Genetically, this conflict can occur at the same or different gene loci. For example, it may be better for one sex to be larger than the other and, assuming that the same genes in both sexes determine body size, a genetic conflict can arise. No interaction between the sexes is necessary for intrasexual conflict to occur. Interlocus conflict happens when the interaction between males and females benefits one while is costly or detrimental to the other. Nuptial gifts, copulatory plugs, forced copulation, genitalia anatomy, mate guarding, biparental care, and other reproductive accessories and tactics are provided as examples of sexual conflict.",

        "abstract": "AbstractTwo decades of in vivo imaging have revealed how diverse the shapes and motion patterns of migrating T cells can be. This finding has sparked the notion of “search strategies”: T cells may have evolved ways to search for antigen efficiently and might even adapt their motion to the task at hand. Mathematical models have indeed confirmed that observed T-cell migration patterns resemble a theoretical optimum in several contexts; for example, frequent turning, stop-and-go motion, or alternating short and long motile runs have all been interpreted as deliberately tuned behaviours, optimising the cell’s chance of finding antigen. But the same behaviours could also arise simply because T cells can’t follow a straight, regular path through the tight spaces they navigate. Even if T cells can be shown to follow a theoretically optimal pattern, the question remains: has that pattern truly been evolved for this particular searching task, or does it merely reflect how the cell’s migration machinery and surroundings constrain motion paths?We here examine to what extent cells can evolve search strategies when faced with realistic constraints. Using a cellular Potts model (CPM), where motion arises from interactions between intracellular dynamics, cell shape, and a constraining environment, we simulate an evolutionary process in which cells “optimise” a simple task: explore as much area as possible. We find that cells evolve several motility characteristics previously attributed to search optimisation, even though these features were not beneficial for the task given here. Our results stress that “optimal” search strategies do not always stem from evolutionary adaptation: instead, they may be the inevitable side effects of interactions between cell shape, intracellular actin dynamics, and the diverse environments T cells face in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn examining the evolution of a particular trait, it’s essential to understand the costs and benefits of that behaviour. Sexual reproduction has many costs. Importantly, sexual reproducers, using the same energy, produce only half as many offspring capable of breeding. This disadvantage is often referred to as the twofold cost of males. Additionally, during meiosis, favourable gene combinations may be broken apart. Species that reproduce sexually must devote a significant amount of time to the activity at both the cellular and organismal levels. In some species, this may involve searching for and assessing mates. Increased energy to produce structures used during reproduction, increased exposure to predators, and increased likelihood of contracting diseases spread through close contact are all costs that asexual breeders don’t encounter. These costs suggest that sexual reproduction must have been offset by significant benefits for it to have evolved.",
