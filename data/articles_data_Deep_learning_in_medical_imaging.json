        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) are emerging tools in the healthcare sector for medical diagnostics. This chapter elaborates on general reasons for the popularity of computational techniques such as deep learning and machine learning (ML) applications in the medical image processing domain. The initial part of this chapter focuses on reviewing the fundamental concepts of DL algorithms, competence with machine learning, need in healthcare, applications, and challenges in medical image processing. Doing so allows understanding the reasons for the construction of all of them and offers a different view on various domains in the medical sector. The tools and technology required for DL, selection, implementation, optimization, and testing are discussed with respect to an application of cancer detection. Thus, this chapter gives an overall vision of deep learning concepts related to biomedical research. ",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is a technique of parsing data, learning from that data, and then applying what has been learned to make informed decisions. Deep learning is actually a subset of machine learning. It technically is machine learning and functions in the same way, but it has different capabilities. The main difference between deep and machine learning is, machine learning models become well progressively, but the model still needs some guidance. If a machine learning model returns an inaccurate prediction, then the programmer needs to fix that problem explicitly, but in the case of deep learning, the model does it by itself. Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning. On other hand, Artificial Intelligence is a different thing from machine learning and deep learning. Deep learning and machine learning both are the subsets of AI. ",

        "abstract": "Medical image processing tools play an important role in clinical routine in helping doctors to establish whether a patient has or does not have a certain disease. To validate the diagnosis results, various clinical parameters must be defined. In this context, several algorithms and mathematical tools have been developed in the last two decades to extract accurate information from medical images or signals. Traditionally, the extraction of features using image processing from medical data are time-consuming which requires human interaction and expert validation. The segmentation of medical images, the classification of medical images, and the significance of deep learning-based algorithms in disease detection are all topics covered in this chapter.",

        "abstract": "Pixel accurate 2-D, 3-D medical image segmentation to identify abnormalities for further analysis is on high demand for computer-aided medical imaging applications. Various segmentation algorithms have been studied and applied in medical imaging for many years, but the problem remains challenging due to growing a large number of variety of applications starting from lung disease diagnosis based on x-ray images, nucleus detection, and segmentation based on microscopic pictures to kidney tumour segmentation. The recent innovation in deep learning brought revolutionary advances in computer vision. Image segmentation is one such area where deep learning shows its capacity and improves the performance by a larger margin than its successor. This chapter overviews the most popular deep learning-based image segmentation techniques and discusses their capabilities and basic advantages and limitations in the domain of medical imaging.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is a special type of machine learning that attains great potency and flexibility by learning to represent input raw data as a nested hierarchy of essences and representations. DL consists of more layers than conventional machine learning that permit higher levels of abstractions and improved prediction from data. More abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones. The goal of this chapter is to present an intensive survey of existing literature on DL techniques over the last years especially in the medical imaging analysis field. All these techniques and algorithms have their points of interest and constraints. Thus, analysis of various techniques and transformations, submitted prior in writing, for plan and utilization of DL methods from medical image analysis prospective will be discussed. The authors provide future research directions in DL area and set trends and identify challenges in the medical imaging field. Furthermore, as quantity of medicinal application demands increase, an extended study and investigation in DL area becomes very significant.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground:\nThe usage of artificial intelligence in medical image analysis has significantly surpassed that of earlier related technologies. This paper aimed to\ninvestigate the diagnostic accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based-deep learning models for breast cancer detection.\n\n\nMethods:\nWe used the PICO (Patient/Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) scheme to formulate the research question and construct our\nsearch terms. Studies were systematically examined from the available literature using the constructed search terms from PubMed, and\nScienceDirect according to the PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. The\ncharacteristics of each included study such as the study design, population, index test, and reference standard, were extracted. The sensitivity,\nspecificity, and AUC for each study were also reported.\n\n\nResults:\nIn this systematic review, 14 studies were analyzed. Eight studies showed that AI was more accurate than radiologists in evaluating mammographic\nimages, while one comprehensive study found AI to be less precise. Studies that reported sensitivity and specificity without radiologist intervention\nshowed performance scores ranging from 16.0% to 89.71%. With radiologist intervention, sensitivity was between 62% to 86%. Only three studies\nreported a specificity of 73.5% to 79%. The AUC of the studies was between 0.79 and 0.95. Thirteen studies were retrospective, and one was\nprospective.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThere's inadequate evidence on the effectiveness of AI-based deep learning for breast cancer screening in clinical settings. More research is\nneeded, including studies evaluating accuracy, RCTs, and large-scale cohort studies. This systematic review found that AI-based deep learning\nimproves radiologists' accuracy, especially for novice radiologists. Younger, tech-savvy clinicians may be more accepting of AI. Although it can't\nreplace radiologists, the encouraging results suggest it will play a significant role in identifying breast cancer in the future.\n",

        "abstract": "\nBackground:\nThe whole world has been severely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and large-scale spread has caused immense pressure on the medical sector hence increasing the chances of false detection due to human errors and mishandling of reports. At the time of outbreaks of COVID-19, there is a crucial shortage of test kits as well. Quick diagnostic testing has become one of the main challenges. For the detection of COVID-19, many Artificial Intelligence based methodologies have been proposed, a few had suggested integration of the model on a public usable platform, but none had executed this on a working application as per our knowledge.\n\n\nObjective:\nKeeping the above comprehension in mind, the objective is to provide an easy-to-use platform for COVID-19 identification. This work would be a contribution to the digitization of health facilities. This work is a fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images to provide a speedy and accurate identification of the COVID-19 virus by analyzing the user's CT scan images of the lungs. It will assist healthcare workers in reducing their workload and decreasing the possibility of false detection.\n\n\nMethods:\nIn this work, various models like Resnet50V2 and Resnet101V2, an adjusted rendition of ResNet101V2 with Feature Pyramid Network, have been applied for classifying the CT scan images into the categories: normal or COVID-19 positive.\n\n\nResults:\nA detailed analysis of all three models' performances have been done on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset with various metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc. It was found that Resnet50V2 achieves an accuracy of 96.79%, whereas Resnet101V2 achieves an accuracy of 97.79%. An accuracy of 98.19% has been obtained by ResNet101V2 with Feature Pyramid Network. As ResNet101V2 with Feature Pyramid Network is showing better results, thus, it is further incorporated into a working application that takes CT images as input from the user and feeds into the trained model and detects the presence of COVID-19 infection.\n\n\nConclusion:\nA mobile application integrated with the deeper variant of ResNet, i.e., ResNet101V2 with FPN checks the presence of COVID-19 in a faster and accurate manner. People can use this application on their smart mobile devices. This automated system would assist healthcare workers as well, which ultimately reduces their workload and decreases the possibility of false detection.\n",

Future research opportunities and challenges of unsupervised deep learning techniques for\nmedical image analysis are also discussed.\n\n\nConclusion:\nCurrently, interpretation of medical images for diagnostic purposes is usually performed\nby human experts that may be replaced by computer-aided diagnosis due to advancement\nin machine learning techniques, including deep learning, and the availability of cheap computing infrastructure\nthrough cloud computing. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches\nare widely applied in medical image analysis, each of them having certain pros and cons.\nSince human supervisions are not always available or are inadequate or biased, therefore, unsupervised\nlearning algorithms give a big hope with lots of advantages for biomedical image analysis.\n",

A literature\nsearch was performed for relevant studies published from 1 January 2020 till 27 March 2021. Out\nof 4050 research papers available in reputed publishers, a full-text review of 440 articles was done\nbased on the keywords of AI, COVID-19, ML, forecasting, DL, X-ray, and Computed Tomography\n(CT). Finally, 52 articles were included in the result synthesis of this paper. As part of the review,\ndifferent ML regression methods were reviewed first in predicting the number of confirmed\nand death cases. Secondly, a comprehensive survey was carried out on the use of ML in classifying\nCOVID-19 patients. Thirdly, different datasets on medical imaging were compared in terms of the\nnumber of images, number of positive samples and number of classes in the datasets. The different\nstages of the diagnosis, including preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction were also reviewed.\nFourthly, the performance results of different research papers were compared to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of DL methods on different datasets.\n\n\nResults:\nResults show that residual neural network (ResNet-18) and densely connected convolutional\nnetwork (DenseNet 169) exhibit excellent classification accuracy for X-ray images, while\nDenseNet-201 has the maximum accuracy in classifying CT scan images. This indicates that ML\nand DL are useful tools in assisting researchers and medical professionals in predicting, screening\nand detecting COVID-19.\n\n\nConclusion:\nFinally, this review highlights the existing challenges, including regulations, noisy data,\ndata privacy, and the lack of reliable large datasets, then provides future research directions in\napplying AI in managing COVID-19.\n",

        "abstract": "\nAbstract:\nDeep learning models have recently been preferred to perform certain image-processing tasks. Recently, with the increasing radiation, heat, and poor lighting conditions, the raw image samples may contain noisy and ambiguous information. To process these images, the deep learning model requires a large number of data samples to learn the missing information from other clear data samples. This necessitates training the neural network with a huge dataset. The researchers are now attempting to filter and improve such noisy images via preprocessing in order to provide valid and accurate feature information to the neural network layers. However, certain research studies claim that some useful information may be lost when the image is not preprocessed with an appropriate filter or enhancement technique. The MSA (meta-synthesis and analysis) approach is utilized in this work to present the impact of the image processing applications done with and without preprocessing steps. Also, this work summarizes the existing deep learning-based image processing models utilizing or not preprocessing steps in their implementation. Finally, this research provides various research insights on the requirement and non-requirement of preprocessing steps in a deep learning-based implementation. This work has also found that 85% of the existing techniques involve a preprocessing step while developing a deep learning model.\n",

        "abstract": "Deep Neutral Networks (DNNs) were initially proposed towards the midst of the 20th century, motivated by the neural structure and mechanism of the human brain. Thanks to major ad-vancements in computational resources, during the past decade DNN-based systems have demonstrated unprecedented performance in terms of accuracy and speed. However, recent work has shown that such models may not be sufficiently robust during the inference process. Furthermore, due to the data-driven learning nature of DNNs, designing interpretable and gen-eralizable networks is a major challenge, especially in critical applications, such as medical Computer Aided Diagnostics (CAD) and other medical imaging tasks, including classification, regression and reconstruction. Within this context, a line of physics-driven approaches for deep learning has recently emerged, aimed at improving the stability and generalization capacity of DNNs for medical imaging applications. In this paper, we review recent work focused on phys-ics-driven or prior-information learning for a variety of imaging modalities and medical applica-tions. We discuss how the inclusion of domain-related knowledge into the learning process and networks’ design supports their stability and generalization capability. In addition, we highlight current and future challenges within this scope.",

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease related to eye correlated with long-standing diabetes. It is a leading cause of blindness among working adults. Detection of this condition in the early stage is critical for good prognosis. Present day detection of DR normally requires digital fundus image or images generated using optical coherence tomography (OCT). As OCT are high-priced, diagnosis of DR using fundus image will benefit for the patient and the ophthalmologists. Manual inspection of morphological changes in blood vessels, microaneurysms, exudates, hemorrhages, and macula are time consuming and tedious tasks. So, designing a computer-aided system helps in analyzing the morphological changes and identifying the DR. This chapter reviews the applications of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for detection of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy by analyzing fundus images. ",

Lung cancer is one of the widespread diseases due to the growth of irregular cell in both the lungs as a result of which this irregular cell starts growing into tumour, and this tumour can be cancerous as well as non-cancerous. In the traditional approach CT scan images has been used based on the report image segmentation has been done to remove the noise so that a clear picture can be generated to detect the location of tumor. Once the location is known then classification or clustering approach can be used to predict the stage of cancer. Previously supervised machine learning algorithm has been used to predict lung cancer. In this work a prediction model is proposed that is based on the median filter, watershed segmentation, and then feature extraction has done like texture and region. And on the extracted feature classification technique was applied for prediction of cancer. ",

Machine learning is being used to offer diagnosis suggestions, identify regions of interest in images, or augment data to remove noise. Training models for such tasks require a large amount of labeled data. It is often difficult to procure such data due to the fact that these requires experts to manually label them, in addition to the privacy and legal concerns that limiting their collection. Due to this, creating self-supervision learning methods and domain-adaptation techniques dedicated to this domain is essential. This paper reviews concepts from the field of deep learning and how they have been applied to medical image analysis. We also review the current state of self-supervised learning methods and their applications to medical images.

        "abstract": "Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.",
