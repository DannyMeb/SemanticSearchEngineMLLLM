        "abstract": "Community detection is a field of interest in social networks. Many new methods have emerged for community detection solution, however the modularity optimization method is the most prominent. Community detection based on modularity optimization (CDMO) has fundamental problems in the form of solution degeneration and resolution limits. From the two problems, the resolution limit is more concerned because it affects the resulting community's quality. During the last decade, many studies have attempted to address the problems, but so far they have been carried out partially, no one has thoroughly discussed efforts to improve the quality of CDMO. In this paper, we aim to investigate works in handling resolution limit and improving the quality of CDMO, along with their strengths and limitations. We derive six categories of strategies to improve the quality of CDMO, namely developing multi-resolution modularity, creating local modularity, creating modularity density, creating new metrics as an alternative to modularity, creating new quality metrics as a substitute for modularity, involving node attributes in determining community detection, and extending the single objective function into a multi-objective function. These strategies can be used as a guide in developing community detection methods. By considering network size, network type, and community distribution, we can choose the appropriate strategy in improving the quality of community detection.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things and other technology breakthroughs have a big impact on how English is taught (IoTV). The investigation of the actual English teaching process and the identification of student features come first. In order to use the interpolation technique with the student image-based feature detection method, we investigate the IoTV reform. As a result, we find a clever algorithm for IoTV that recognises student features more effectively. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the design technique used to create the intelligence algorithm for pupil feature recognition. A comprehensive multifunctional human-computer interaction system utilizes a variety of input and output streams. In addition to the standard computer keyboard, cursor clicking, and screen touching, the most recent speech and facial recognition technology can be employed for data input. Students learned to orally interact with the robot and act as a guide to various destinations. The Multimodal Interaction System for English Education (MMIEE) is an investigation into the use of network and artificial intelligence (AI) in teaching. Recurrent neural network (Rein RNN)-based Reinforced learning is utilized for the perpectual evaluation model to categorize the questions posed by teachers in terms of their content and kind, and to conduct experimental investigation. The results show that the proposed Rein_RNN model achieves 98.6% of accuracy in 4.3sec of mean evaluation time.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores how AI policy documents mediate the stabilization of socio-technical assemblages. It does so by developing the theory-methods package of ‘discursive infrastructuring’ and applying it to the U.K.’s National AI Strategy. By centering the conceptual slipperiness of emerging technologies such as AI, this framework sheds light on how policy documents work to stabilize emerging socio-technical assemblages comprising specific actors, ideologies, flows of capital, and relationships of power. In the context of the National AI Strategy, discursive infrastructuring reveals how the document stabilises: AI as an autonomous and inevitable force; a technical/social dualism which privileges the technical over the social in driving innovation; the ‘heroic engineer’ as an individual, masculine and rational archetype; and, the U.K. as a dominant and modernising player on AI’s global stage. This assemblage does not only exist in the document’s words; it is translated into practice through the funding of institutions, the centring of technical pedagogies of AI, and the opening of visa routes for ‘globally mobile individuals’. The application of ‘discursive infrastructuring’ to the National AI Strategy thus elucidates the constitutive role of policy discourse in stabilising politically situated material-semiotic conceptions of AI.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nThe utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the biomedical field has attracted increasing attention in recent decades. Studying how past AI technologies have found their way into medicine over time can help to predict which current (and future) AI technologies have the potential to be utilized in medicine in the coming years, thereby providing a helpful reference for future research directions.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to predict the future trend of AI technologies used in different biomedical domains based on past trends of related technologies and biomedical domains.\n\n\nMethods\nWe collected a large corpus of articles from the PubMed database pertaining to the intersection of AI and biomedicine. Initially, we attempted to use regression on the extracted keywords alone; however, we found that this approach did not provide sufficient information. Therefore, we propose a method called “background-enhanced prediction” to expand the knowledge utilized by the regression algorithm by incorporating both the keywords and their surrounding context. This method of data construction resulted in improved performance across the six regression models evaluated. Our findings were confirmed through experiments on recurrent prediction and forecasting.\n\n\nResults\nIn our analysis using background information for prediction, we found that a window size of 3 yielded the best results, outperforming the use of keywords alone. Furthermore, utilizing data only prior to 2017, our regression projections for the period of 2017-2021 exhibited a high coefficient of determination (R2), which reached up to 0.78, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in predicting long-term trends. Based on the prediction, studies related to proteins and tumors will be pushed out of the top 20 and become replaced by early diagnostics, tomography, and other detection technologies. These are certain areas that are well-suited to incorporate AI technology. Deep learning, machine learning, and neural networks continue to be the dominant AI technologies in biomedical applications. Generative adversarial networks represent an emerging technology with a strong growth trend.\n\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, we explored AI trends in the biomedical field and developed a predictive model to forecast future trends. Our findings were confirmed through experiments on current trends.\n",

These networks deal with the above problems by adjusting their parameters through various optimization techniques. However, an important issue to address is the need to locate a satisfactory interval for the parameters of a network before adjusting these parameters. This paper proposes a two-stage method. In the first stage, via the incorporation of grammatical evolution, rules are generated to create the optimal value interval of the network parameters. During the second stage of the technique, the mentioned parameters are fine-tuned with a genetic algorithm. The current work was tested on a number of datasets from the recent literature and found to reduce the classification or data fitting error by over 40% on most datasets. In addition, the proposed method appears in the experiments to be robust, as the fluctuation of the number of network parameters does not significantly affect its performance.",

        "abstract": "Perhaps one of the best-known machine learning models is the artificial neural network, where a number of parameters must be adjusted to learn a wide range of practical problems from areas such as physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. Such problems can be reduced to pattern recognition problems and then modeled from artificial neural networks, whether these problems are classification problems or regression problems. To achieve the goal of neural networks, they must be trained by appropriately adjusting their parameters using some global optimization methods. In this work, the application of a recent global minimization technique is suggested for the adjustment of neural network parameters. In this technique, an approximation of the objective function to be minimized is created using artificial neural networks and then sampling is performed from the approximation function and not the original one. Therefore, in the present work, learning of the parameters of artificial neural networks is performed using other neural networks. The new training method was tested on a series of well-known problems, a comparative study was conducted against other neural network parameter tuning techniques, and the results were more than promising. From what was seen after performing the experiments and comparing the proposed technique with others that have been used for classification datasets as well as regression datasets, there was a significant difference in the performance of the proposed technique, starting with 30% for classification datasets and reaching 50% for regression problems. However, the proposed technique, because it presupposes the use of global optimization techniques involving artificial neural networks, may require significantly higher execution time than other techniques.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nEmerging artificial intelligence (AI) applications have the potential to improve health, but they may also perpetuate or exacerbate inequities.\n\n\nObjective\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the health equity issues related to the use of AI applications and identify strategies proposed to address them.\n\n\nMethods\nWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Xplore Digital Library, ProQuest U.S. Newsstream, Academic Search Complete, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify academic and gray literature related to AI and health equity that were published between 2014 and 2021 and additional literature related to AI and health equity during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 and 2021. Literature was eligible for inclusion in our review if it identified at least one equity issue and a corresponding strategy to address it. To organize and synthesize equity issues, we adopted a 4-step AI application framework: Background Context, Data Characteristics, Model Design, and Deployment. We then created a many-to-many mapping of the links between issues and strategies.\n\n\nResults\nIn 660 documents, we identified 18 equity issues and 15 strategies to address them. Equity issues related to Data Characteristics and Model Design were the most common. The most common strategies recommended to improve equity were improving the quantity and quality of data, evaluating the disparities introduced by an application, increasing model reporting and transparency, involving the broader community in AI application development, and improving governance.\n\n\nConclusions\nStakeholders should review our many-to-many mapping of equity issues and strategies when planning, developing, and implementing AI applications in health care so that they can make appropriate plans to ensure equity for populations affected by their products. AI application developers should consider adopting equity-focused checklists, and regulators such as the FDA should consider requiring them. Given that our review was limited to documents published online, developers may have unpublished knowledge of additional issues and strategies that we were unable to identify.\n",

        "abstract": "Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are involved in an extensive variety of biological procedures, including cell-to-cell interactions, and metabolic and developmental control. PPIs are becoming one of the most important aims of system biology. PPIs act as a fundamental part in predicting the protein function of the target protein and the drug ability of molecules. An abundance of work has been performed to develop methods to computationally predict PPIs as this supplements laboratory trials and offers a cost-effective way of predicting the most likely set of interactions at the entire proteome scale. This article presents an innovative feature representation method (CAA-PPI) to extract features from protein sequences using two different encoding strategies followed by an ensemble learning method. The random forest methodwas used as a classifier for PPI prediction. CAA-PPI considers the role of the trigram and bond of a given amino acid with its nearby ones. The proposed PPI model achieved more than a 98% prediction accuracy with one encoding scheme and more than a 95% prediction accuracy with another encoding scheme for the two diverse PPI datasets, i.e., H. pylori and Yeast. Further, investigations were performed to compare the CAA-PPI approach with existing sequence-based methods and revealed the proficiency of the proposed method with both encoding strategies. To further assess the practical prediction competence, a blind test was implemented on five other species’ datasets independent of the training set, and the obtained results ascertained the productivity of CAA-PPI with both encoding schemes.",

The goal of mean-variance portfolio selection is to maximize expected return with minimizing risk. The Markowitz model was employed to solve the linear portfolio selection problem. However, due to numerous constraints and complexities, the problem is so critical that traditional models are insufficient to provide efficient solutions. Teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a powerful population-based nature-inspired approach to solve optimization problems. This article presents a portfolio selection model using the TLBO approach to maximize the portfolio's Sharpe Ratio. The Sharpe ratio combines both expected return and risk. This algorithm model the natural teaching process of the classroom with two main phases, viz., teaching and learning. Performance analysis has been undertaken to investigate the suitability of TLBO based solution approach by comparing it with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) on the real datasets, Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX) 100, Hang Seng 31, Standard and Poor’s  (S&amp;P) 100, financial times stock exchange (FTSE) 100, and Nikkei 225.

A descriptive and statistical analysis of learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) among 157 students was conducted using Google Forms surveys and SPSS analysis. The results show a predominance of the visual style, suggesting that teaching methods commonly used by faculty may have influenced the modification of students' Learning Styles to include more visual resources. The absence of the kinesthetic style is discussed, thus raising the hypothesis to be tested in ongoing studies that traditional educational methodology may influence the evolution of learning styles. This study highlights the importance of recognizing and adapting teaching strategies to predominant learning styles to enhance the effectiveness of the educational process. The findings suggest the need to integrate more visual resources into teaching while considering the variability and potential evolution of learning styles due to the educational methodology employed.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited remarkable potential in effectively tackling the intricate task of classifying MRI images, specifically in Alzheimer’s disease detection and brain tumor identification. While CNNs optimize their parameters automatically through training processes, finding the optimal values for these parameters can still be a challenging task due to the complexity of the search space and the potential for suboptimal results. Consequently, researchers often encounter difficulties determining the ideal parameter settings for CNNs. This challenge necessitates using trial-and-error methods or expert judgment, as the search for the best combination of parameters involves exploring a vast space of possibilities. Despite the automatic optimization during training, the process does not guarantee finding the globally-optimal parameter values. Hence, researchers often rely on iterative experimentation and expert knowledge to fine-tune these parameters and maximize CNN performance. This poses a significant obstacle in developing real-world applications that leverage CNNs for MRI image analysis. This paper presents a new hybrid model that combines the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with CNNs to enhance detection and classification capabilities. Our method utilizes the PSO algorithm to determine the optimal configuration of CNN hyper-parameters. Subsequently, these optimized parameters are applied to the CNN architectures for classification. As a result, our hybrid model exhibits improved prediction accuracy for brain diseases while reducing the loss of function value. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted experiments using three benchmark datasets. Two datasets were utilized for Alzheimer’s disease: the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and an international dataset from Kaggle. The third dataset focused on brain tumors. The experimental assessment demonstrated the superiority of our proposed model, achieving unprecedented accuracy rates of 98.50%, 98.83%, and 97.12% for the datasets mentioned earlier, respectively.",

Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) have been emphasized for providing seamless connectivity with high quality of service (QoS) performance to provision IoT applications. However, the existing resource allocation scheme suffers from interference and fails to provide a quality experience for low-priority users. As a result, induce bandwidth wastage and increase handover failure. In addressing the research issues this paper presented the resource-optimized network selection (RONS) method for HWNs. The RONS method employs better load balancing to reduce handover failure and maximizes resource utilization through dynamic slot optimization. The RONS method assures tradeoffs between high performance to high priority users and quality of experience (QoE) for low priority users.

This research focuses on detecting abnormalities in societal infiltration using the hyperparameters optimization XGBoost (HO-XGB) algorithm with the Communications Security Establishment-The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity-Intrusion Detection System2018 (CSE-CIC-IDS2018) dataset to get the best potential results. When compared to typical machine learning methods published in the literature, HO-XGB outperforms them. The study shows that XGBoost outperforms other detection algorithms. We refined the HO-XGB model's hyperparameters, which included learning_rate, subsample, max_leaves, max_depth, gamma, colsample_bytree, min_child_weight, n_estimators, max_depth, and reg_alpha. The experimental findings reveal that HO-XGB1 outperforms multiple parameter settings for intrusion detection, effectively optimizing XGBoost's hyperparameters.</p>",

The critical issue associated with any portfolio under its optimization entails the achievement of an optimal Sharpe ratio related to risk-return. This issue turns complex when risk budgeting and other investor preferential constraints are weighed in, rendering it difficult for direct solving via conventional approaches. As such, this present study proposes a novel technique that addresses the problem of constrained risk budgeted optimization with multiple crossovers (binomial, exponential &amp; arithmetic) together with the hall of fame via  differential evolution (DE) strategies. The proposed automated solution facilitates portfolio managers to adopt the best possible portfolio that yields the most lucrative returns. In addition, the outcome coherence is verified by monitoring the best blend of evolution strategies. As a result, imminent outcomes were selected based on the best mixture of portfolio returns and Sharpe ratio. The monthly stock prices of Nifty50 were included in this study.</span></div>",

        "abstract": "A Multiobjective Optimization Problem (MOP) requires the optimization of several objective functions simultaneously, usually in conflict with each other. One of the most efficient algorithms for solving MOPs is MOEA/D (Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition), which decomposes a MOP into single-objective optimization subproblems and solves them using information from neighboring subproblems. MOEA/D variants with other evolutionary operators have emerged over the years, improving their efficiency in various MOPs. Recently, the IWOA (Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm) was proposed, an optimization algorithm bioinspired by the whale hunting method hybridized with Differential Evolution, which presented excellent results in single-objective optimization problems. This work proposes the MOEA/D-IWOA algorithm, which associates characteristics of the evolutionary operators of the IWOA to MOEA/D. Computational experiments were accomplished to analyze the performance of the MOEA/D-IWOA in benchmark MOPs suites. The results were compared with those obtained by the MOEA/D, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Third Evolution Step of Generalized Differential Evolution (GDE3), Improving the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), and Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) algorithms in the Hypervolume and Inverted Generational Distance Plus (IGD+) indicators.

Network providers employ various strategies to handle multimedia traffic in IoT applications efficiently. But most of these methods have not considered optimizing the RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol), RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol), and RTCP (Real-Time Control Protocol) to improve the throughput and QoS of the IoT applications. Hence, in this Congestion and Throughput Optimization Protocol (CTOP) work, we present a model which optimizes the RTSP, RTP, and RTCP protocol to improve the throughput and QoS. The CTOP model outperforms the Big Packet Protocol model in terms of average throughput, multimedia loss, delay, and energy consumption for both less and high-traffic scenarios. For less-level of traffic and high level of traffic, the CTOP model achieves a better average throughput, and average multimedia delay, reducing the average multimedia loss and average energy consumption in comparison to the existing BBP model.

However, these systems are still in the laboratory stage and not yet ready for commercialization due to unresolved difficulties. While previous reviews have focused on individual technologies, system composition, and surgical stages, a comprehensive review is necessary to assist future scholars in selecting appropriate research directions for clinical use.Methods: A literature review using Google Scholar identified articles on robot-assisted fracture reduction systems. A comprehensive search yielded 17,800, 18,100, and 16,700 results for “fracture reduction,” “computer-assisted orthopedic surgery,” and “robot-assisted fracture reduction,” respectively. Approximately 340 articles were selected, and 90 highly relevant articles were chosen for further reading after reviewing the abstracts.Results and Conclusion: Robot-assisted fracture reduction systems offer several benefits, including improved reduction accuracy, reduced physical work and radiation exposure, enhanced preoperative planning and intraoperative visualization, and shortened learning curve for skill acquisition. In the future, these systems will become integrated and practical, with automatic preoperative planning and high intraoperative safety.",

The localization of mobile sensor nodes massively depends upon the received signal strength (RSS). Recently, the least squared relative error (LSRE) measurements are optimized using traditional semidefinite programming (SDP) and the location of the mobile sensor nodes was determined using the previous localization methods like least squared relative error and semidefinite programming (LSRE-SDP), and approximate nonlinear least squares and semidefinite programming (ANLS-SDP). Therefore, in this work, a novel high uncertainty aware-localization error correction and optimization (HUA-LECO) model is employed to minimize the aforementioned problems regarding the localization of mobile sensor nodes and enhance the performance efficiency of root mean square error (RMSE) results. Here, the position of target mobile sensor nodes is evaluated based on the gathered measurements while discarding faulty data. Here, an iterative weight updation approach is utilized to perform localization based on Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show significant improvement in terms of RMSE results in comparison with traditional LSRE-SDP and ANLS-SDP methods under high uncertainty.</p>",

In addition to the quality of communication services, the quality of AI services (QoAISs) includes multiple dimensions, such as AI model accuracy, overhead, and data privacy. This paper proposes a QoAIS optimization method for AI training services in 6G native AI wireless networks. To improve the accuracy and reduce the delay of AI services, we formulate an integer programming problem to obtain proper task scheduling and resource allocation decisions. To quickly obtain decisions that meet the requirements of each dimension of QoAIS, we further transform the single-objective optimization problem into a multi-objective format to facilitate the QoAIS configuration of network protocols. Considering the computational complexity, we propose G-TSRA and NSG-TSRA heuristic algorithms to solve the proposed problems. Finally, the feasibility and performance of QoAIS optimization are verified by simulation.",

A disease's ability to be prevented and effectively significantly treated depends on early diagnosis. The addition of filter feature selection to the machine learning algorithm has been done to detect CKD. However, the quality of its feature subset is not optimal. Wrapper feature selection can improve the quality of these feature subsets. Therefore, we proposed wrapper feature selection and binary whale optimization algorithm (BWOA) to enhance the accuracy of early CKD detection. We also make data improvements to improve accuracy, namely the preprocessing process with the median and modus techniques. We used a public dataset of 250 medical records of kidney sufferers and 150 completely healthy people. There are 24 features in this dataset. The test results showed that adding BWOA feature selection can increase accuracy. The proposed method produced an accuracy of 100%. Further research on these methods can be used to develop expert systems for early detection of CKD.",

Lamb waves are guided elastic waves, are widely employed in nondestructive testing thanks to their attractive properties such as their sensitivity to the small defects. In this work, finite element method was conducted by Abaqus to study Lamb modes propagation. A data collection is performed by the signals recorded from the sensor of 300 models: healthy and damaged plates excited by a tone burst signal with the frequencies: 100 kHz, 125 kHz, 150 kHz, 175 kHz, 200 kHz, and 225 kHz. The captured signals in undamaged plat are the baseline, whereas the signals measured in damaged plates are recorded for various positions of external rectangular defects. To reduce the amount of training data, only two peaks of measured signals are required to be the input of the model. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was adopted to calculate the key features of the signal in the time domain. The feed forward neural network is implemented using MATLAB program. The data are divided as follows: 70% for training the model, 25% for the validation, and 5% for the test. The proposed model is accurate estimating the position of the defect with an accuracy of 99.98%.",

Despite the clear importance of uncertainty quantification in decision-making, we find that constraints in time, hardware, and costs are often limiting factors during field evaluation, with the drawback of having a biased uncertainty description or a wrong risk perception. The proposed work encompasses history matching, solution analysis, and production optimization with special emphasis on reducing both simulation and processing time, maximizing what we can call the result per core hour.\nAt the center of our work is an AI-guided optimizer suited to avoid excessive convergence bias and maintain an optimal exploration vs. exploitation performance. The optimizer allows the integration of a multi-objective (MO) formulation in standard history matching and optimization workflows. Despite the flexibility of MO optimization and the vast literature in the energy industry, its usage in real-field cases has always been quite limited due to its formulation availability in commercial software and the increased computation time. This work will show improvement in solution accuracy and formulation flexibility compared to Single Objective (SO) formulations at no increase in runtime.\nMO is based on the iterative convergence of an efficient frontier from the results generated by the simulation. This same concept has been brought to a user analysis step to allow the identification of best solutions across multiple evaluation workflows, lowering the expertise level for a solution.",

Therefore, the automatic classification of IT tickets becomes a significant challenge. Feature selection becomes most important, particularly in data sets with several variables and features. However, enhance classification's precision and performance by stopping insignificant variables. Through our earlier research, we have categorized the unsupervised ticket dataset. As a result, we have converted the dataset into a supervised dataset. In this article, the classification of different IT tickets on Machine learning algorithms, Feature ranking, and feature selection techniques are used to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms. However, compared to the machine learning (ML) algorithms, the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm provides a better classification of the token IDs and provide better accuracy.",

The proposed algorithm generated results that will be contrasted to previous studies on the same topic with different metaheuristic methods such as a genetic algorithm.

At Concordia, one department that I know of has already circulated a working document about AI, outlining problems and strategies—this is what we need more of for sure. The English Department at Concordia has started meetings, and many discussions are taking place at the Cegep level on both the departmental and administrative levels. Is there anything we can really do, is a major question that I feel, for now, might not have an answer. What we do need to do is figure out how to address AI, how to find it/spot-it, and via our pedagogies how to motivate students not to use AI. In short, yes, we can—solutions are popping up to detect AI and, most of all, we need to make sure we don’t overload our own work schedules trying to outsmart students who use AI. This article presents an overview of obstacles that current course instructors face, be they tenured faculty, lecturers, non-permanent/part-time faculty, or teaching-assistants ; as well, this informal discussion of such problems and findings is the beginning to a discussion on how to manage course content and time without burning out as we navigate the often confusing realities associated with AI and the internet as a source where students can readily cheat and/or plagiarize.

In this research, we introduce a hybrid supervised learning using metaheuristic technique for optimum FE and FS termed Northern Goshawk optimization (NGO) and opposition-based learning (OBL). Pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and recognition are the three steps of the proposed technique. The pre-processing is done first to lessen the amount of noise. In the FE stage, we extract features. The OBL-NGO method is used to pick the best collection of extracted characteristics. Finally, these optimised features are utilised to train the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier, and the matching text is shown as the output based on these optimised characteristics of the provided input audio signal. The system's performance is outstanding, and the suggested OBL-NGO is best suited for ASR, according to the testing data.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

Cialdini's (2001-2021) persuasion strategies (principles), as well as Keptein's STPS (2009), were applied to measure the susceptibility to persuasion of individuals of both genders with different marital status. The results of an analysis of variance (ANOVA), measuring the influence of gender, showed that on the criterion of susceptibility to persuasion, males were more influenced by the following strategies: liking, reciprocity, authority, and social proof relative to females with the exception of the principle of commitment and consistency, and individuals who are divorced, separated and widowed responded positively to strategies such as social proof, scarcity and authority. Through regression analysis, social influence was found for unmarried users with respect to the reciprocity principle, as well as authority and scarcity when combining the latter strategies. Individuals who are cohabiting or married, as well as divorced, separated, and widowed, gave positive advertising responses to the scarcity principle, but cohabiting and married consumers exhibiting commitment and consistency under the influence of advertising. Hence, this study can serve organizations offering products and services through advertising, and its originality lies in the findings of mixed consumer responses regarding gender and marital status.",

        "abstract": "\nAbstract\nMelanoma accounts for a small proportion of skin cancers diagnosed each year, but it has a high degree of malignancy and rapid progression, resulting in a short survival period for patients. The incidence of melanoma continues to rise, and now melanoma accounts for 1.7% of cancer diagnoses worldwide and is the fifth most common cancer in the United States. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the understanding of the pathophysiology of melanoma had also been improved. The most common activating mutations in melanoma cells are BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations, which disrupt cell signaling pathways related to tumor proliferation. The progress has led to the emergence of molecularly targeted drugs, which extends the survival of patients with advanced melanoma. A large number of clinical trials have been conducted to confirm that targeted therapy for patients with advanced melanoma can improve progression-free survival and overall survival, and for stage III patients after radical tumor resection targeted therapy can reduce the recurrence of melanoma. Patients who were originally stage III or IV inoperable have the opportunity to achieve tumor radical resection after targeted therapy. This article reviewed the clinical trial data and summarized the clinical benefits and limitations of these therapies.\n",

Computation offloading is the main feature that makes Edge computing surpass the existing cloud-based technologies to break limitations such as computing capabilities, battery resources, and storage availability, it enhances the durability and performance of mobile devices by offloading local intensive computation tasks to edge servers. However, the optimal solution is not always guaranteed by offloading computation, therefore, the offloading decision is a crucial step depending on many parameters that should be taken in consideration.

This novel therapeutic tool allows the specialist to keep track of the improvement in socially assistive tasks for autistic children, who hypothetically prefer object-based over human interactions. These kinds of tools also allow the collection of new information to early diagnose neurodevelopment disabilities. This work presents the integration of an output feedback adaptive controller for trajectory tracking and energetic autonomy of a mobile socially assistive robot for autism spectrum disorder under an event-driven control scheme. The proposed implementation integrates facial expression and emotion recognition algorithms to detect the emotions and identities of users (providing robustness to the algorithm since it automatically generates the missing input parameters, which allows it to complete the recognition) to detonate a set of adequate trajectories. The algorithmic implementation for the proposed socially assistive robot is presented and implemented in the Linux-based Robot Operating System. It is considered that the optimization of energetic consumption of the proposal is the main contribution of this work, as it will allow therapists to extend and adapt sessions with autistic children. The experiment that validates the energetic optimization of the proposed integration of an event-driven control scheme is presented.",

The most familiar and suitable speedy clustering algorithm is K-means than other traditional clustering approaches. But K-means is extra sensitive for initialization of clustering centroid and it can easily surround. Thus, there is a necessity for faster clustering with an effective optimum clustering centroid. Based on that, this research paper projected an optimization-based clustering by hybrid fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering on rainfall flow optimization technique (RFFO), which is the normal flow and behavior of rainfall flow from one position to another position. FCM clustering algorithm is used to cluster the given medical data and RFFO is used to produce optimum clustering centroid. Finally, the clustering performance is also measured for the proposed FCM clustering on RFFO technique with the help of accuracy, random coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient for medical data set and find the risk factor of a heart attack.</span>",

        "abstract": "Accurate texture classification empowers robots to improve their perception and comprehension of the environment, enabling informed decision-making and appropriate responses to diverse materials and surfaces. Still, there are challenges for texture classification regarding the vast amount of time series data generated from robots’ sensors. For instance, robots are anticipated to leverage human feedback during interactions with the environment, particularly in cases of misclassification or uncertainty. With the diversity of objects and textures in daily activities, Active Learning (AL) can be employed to minimize the number of samples the robot needs to request from humans, streamlining the learning process. In the present work, we use AL to select the most informative samples for annotation, thus reducing the human labeling effort required to achieve high performance for classifying textures. We also use a sliding window strategy for extracting features from the sensor’s time series used in our experiments. Our multi-class dataset (e.g., 12 textures) challenges traditional AL strategies since standard techniques cannot control the number of instances per class selected to be labeled. Therefore, we propose a novel class-balancing instance selection algorithm that we integrate with standard AL strategies. Moreover, we evaluate the effect of sliding windows of two-time intervals (3 and 6 s) on our AL Strategies. Finally, we analyze in our experiments the performance of AL strategies, with and without the balancing algorithm, regarding f1-score, and positive effects are observed in terms of performance when using our proposed data pipeline. Our results show that the training data can be reduced to 70% using an AL strategy regardless of the machine learning model and reach, and in many cases, surpass a baseline performance. Finally, exploring the textures with a 6-s window achieves the best performance, and using either Extra Trees produces an average f1-score of 90.21% in the texture classification data set.",

        "abstract": "The journey of search engine optimization (SEO) from its nascent stage to the present day has been remarkable. Emerging alongside the proliferation of search engines, SEO quickly became an indispensable tool for businesses and marketers striving to enhance their online visibility, attract traffic, and improve rankings. However, as search algorithms advanced, SEO professionals encountered a dynamic landscape marked by evolving trends and new obstacles. For this reason, over time, the factors influencing website ranking have undergone a significant expansion, evolving from a limited set to a multifaceted array. Specific components, such as high-quality backlinks, mobile optimization, local SEO strategies, integration with social media platforms, and the optimization of user experience, have emerged as pivotal determinants of SEO success. These elements assume a critical role in achieving elevated rankings and heightened visibility across search engines, thereby shaping the contemporary landscape of SEO practices.\n\nMore recently, as search engines and SEO evolve in sophistication, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found relevance in its integration into SEO. This involvement of AI amidst its benefits, also introduced new challenges and ethical dilemmas into the discuss on search engine optimization (SEO). SEO strategies must exhibit adaptability to maintain efficacy in driving visibility, traffic, and revenue. It is crucial to strike a balance between data-driven decision-making and empathetic marketing. Businesses shouldn't rely solely on AI to preserve the human touch in their marketing endeavors. Hence, navigating the ever-changing terrain of SEO requires marketers and SEO experts to remain attuned to emerging trends and adept at adapting strategies to meet evolving challenges. By leveraging the diverse array of factors influencing SEO success, businesses can enhance their online presence and effectively engage with their target audience in the competitive digital landscape.

This can include determining the overall sentiment of a piece of text (e.g., positive or negative), as well as identifying specific emotions or opinions expressed in the text, that involves the use of advanced machine and deep learning techniques. Recently, transformer-based language models make this task of human emotion analysis intuitive, thanks to the attention mechanism and parallel computation. These advantages make such models very powerful on linguistic tasks, unlike recurrent neural networks that spend a lot of time on sequential processing, making them prone to fail when it comes to processing long text. The scope of our paper aims to study the behaviour of the cutting-edge Transformer-based language models on opinion mining and provide a high-level comparison between them to highlight their key particularities.

        "abstract": "Background. Radio network planning is one of the main phases of the cellular network lifecycle, as it determines capital and operating costs and allows system performance evaluation at any given time. An accurate and comprehensive analysis of existing network statistics is necessary for proper cell planning during network expansion. These statistics are collected throughout the life cycle of the cellular network and usually have certain imperfections (heterogeneity of statistics, which have different densities in different parts of the search space, up to the presence of significant voids, etc.) The system describing the functioning of the radio network can be represented as a black box because its internal processes are too complex to be defined by mathematical functions. This determines the need to use appropriate tools.\r\nObjective. The purpose of the paper is to create a toolkit that allows finding the proper relationships between network parameters to define target values that will help to build an effective network plan in terms of performance and costs for its creation and operation. The tools should be able to work efficiently using the minimum set of available statistical data, as well as taking into account their imperfections.\r\nMethods. Mathematical estimation and optimization methods are used, namely Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression, Lasso, Elastic-net, LARS lasso, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Automatic Relevance Determination, Stochastic gradient descent, Theil-Sen estimator, Huber Regression, Quantile regression, Polynomial regression. We consider 12 estimation methods in combination with two optimization strategies. Additionally, the method of partial analysis of the search space with different number of configurations is considered.\r\nResults. A software package using the Python programming language has been created, which contains a practical implementation of all the considered estimation and optimization methods, as well as tools for evaluating arbitrary configurations of the software package (benchmark) and visualizing the results. The best estimation method is Ordinary Least Squares for finding the optimal configuration of the statistical parameters of the 4G radio network to maximize the download speed. To obtain satisfactory results, it is enough to consider 25 initial and 250 estimated points - a larger number of points will not significantly increase prediction accuracy.\r\nConclusions. The results indicate the possibility of using the created software package for radio network planning tasks. Further research is aimed at expanding the created software package's functionality and considering additional estimation methods and optimization strategies.\r\nKeywords: radio network planning; radio network optimization; cellular networks; estimation techniques; optimization strategies; big data; 2G; 3G; 4G; CQI; capacity.",

We are currently implementing advanced techniques involving wellhead electrification and predictive control schemes to reduce emissions and maximize production.\nThe nature of the oil production profile is nonlinear, with complex interactions between the characteristics of the reservoir, the fluid dynamics inherent to the process equipment, various artificial lift methods, and the often-constrained midstream and pipeline takeaway capacities. The improved infrastructure and control system capabilities in recent times facilitate addressing the issues such as non-routine emissions, production downtimes, and overwhelming control rooms.\nSeveral innovative concepts such as wellhead electrification, tankless facilities, and pipeline regional volume control (RVC) were engineered to manage the dynamics and correlation to proactively eliminate the vulnerabilities. The facilities’ engineering basis of design and the ongoing well-test data were used to define the priority of the tasks recommended by the optimization algorithms.

This problem has been solved by many metaheuristic optimization techniques to obtain the optimal relay parameters and to have an optimal coordination of the protection relays by considering the coordination constraints. In this article, a comparative study of the optimization techniques proposed in the literature addresses the optimal coordination problem using digital DOCRs with standard properties according to IEC60-255. For this purpose, the three most efficient and robust optimization techniques, which are particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE), are considered. Simulations were performed using MATLAB R2021a by applying the optimization methods to an interconnected 9-bus and 15-bus power distribution systems. The obtained simulation results show that, in case of distributed generation, the best optimization method to solve the relay protection coordination problem is the differential evolution DE. </span>",

This paper presents a new IDS algorithm that combines the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with a pigeon-inspired optimizer in feature selection. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on network security layer - knowledge discovery in databases (NSL-KDD) datasets and demonstrated improved performance in terms of training speed and accuracy compared to previous IDS models.

While the addition of internal electrodes improves the sensor’s spatial resolution, there still remain variations in resolution that depend on the contact position. In this study, we propose an optimization algorithm for electrode positions that improves entire spatial resolution by compensating for local variations in spatial resolution. Simulation results for sensors with 16 or 64 electrodes show that the proposed algorithm improves performance to 0.81 times and 0.93 times in the worst spatial resolution region of the detection area compared to equally spaced grid electrodes. The proposed methods enable tomographic tactile sensors to detect contact pressure distribution more accurately than the conventional methods, providing high-performance tactile sensing for many applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCoreless Filament Winding (CFW) is a structural and time-efficient fabrication method for composite lattice structures. Since the fiber is wound around pins whose diameter cannot be infinitesimally small, each structural element may have four possible beam configurations, which depend on the in-plane local coordinates of the start and/or end of the beam. In this case, layer inconsistency, a condition that a structural element with multiple layers has different beam configurations, may inevitably occur in the fabricated structure. It will decrease the second moment of area of the structural element and may lead to reduced flexural stiffness of the structure. However, this effect was not considered in previous research. Therefore, a detailed Finite Element Model (FEM) which characterizes the practical beam configurations was developed to explore the influence of layer inconsistency on the flexural stiffness of the structure. To improve the structural-efficiency and the fabrication speed, a structural optimization was conducted to minimize the fiber-length and provide the feasibility to wind with continuous roving(s). In addition, a winding sequence optimization was then implemented to minimize the stiffness reduction effect due to layer inconsistency. The detailed FEM provides a reliable prediction of the structural stiffness (average error ⩽ 5.4%). Moreover, the developed sequence optimization decreases the stiffness reduction due to layer inconsistency from 51.3% to 13.7%. The proposed strategies of structural and sequence optimization provide instructions for the design and fabrication of CFW structures, which improve the fabrication time-efficiency and the structural-efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLife history theory indicates that individuals/species with a slow pace of life invest more in acquired than innate immunity. Factors that decrease the pace of life and predict greater investment in acquired immunity include increased nutritional resources, increased pathogen exposure and decreased risk of extrinsic mortality. Common care behaviors given to sick individuals produce exactly these effects: provisioning increases nutritional resources; hygiene assistance increases disease exposure of carers; and protection can reduce the risk of extrinsic mortality to sick individuals. This study, therefore, investigated under what conditions care giving behaviors might impact immune strategy and pace of life. The study employed an agent-based model approach that simulated populations with varying levels of care giving, disease mortality, disease transmissibility, and extrinsic mortality, enabling measurements of how the immune strategy and age structure of the populations changed over evolutionary time. We used multiple regressions to examine the effects of these variables on immune strategy and the age structure of the population. The findings supported our predictions that care was selected for an acquired immunity. However, the pace of life did not slow as expected. Instead, the population shifted to a faster, but also more cost-intensive reproductive strategy in which care improved child survival by subsidizing the development of acquired immune responses.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe growing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) word processing models have demonstrated exceptional potential to impact language related tasks and functions. Their fast pace of adoption and probable effect has also given rise to controversy within certain fields. Models, such as GPT-3, are a particular concern for professionals engaged in writing, particularly as their engagement with these technologies is limited due to lack of ability to control their output. Most efforts to maximize and control output rely on a process known as prompt engineering, the construction and modification of the inputted prompt with expectation for certain outputted or desired text. Consequently, prompt engineering has emerged as an important consideration for research and practice. Previous conceptions of prompt engineering have largely focused on technical and logistic modifications to the back-end processing, remaining inaccessible and, still, limited for most users. In this paper, we look to the technical communication field and its methods of text generation—the rhetorical situation—to conceptualize prompt engineering in a more comprehensible way for its users by considering the context and rhetoric. We introduce a framework, consisting of a formula, to prompt engineering, which demands all components of the rhetorical situation be present in the inputted prompt. We present discussions on the future of AI writing models and their use in both professional and educational settings. Ultimately, this discussion and its findings aim to provide a means of integrating agency and writer-centric methods to AI writing tools to advance a more human-in-the-loop approach. As the use of generative AI and especially NLP-based technologies become common across societal functions, the use of prompt engineering will play a crucial role not just in adoption of the technology, but also its productive and responsible use.",

        "abstract": "- The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has underscored the need for advanced cloud infrastructures capable of efficiently managing AI-intensive workloads. This paper delves into the intricacies of workload allocation and scheduling in the context of cloud environments, specifically focusing on the challenges posed by AI-intensive tasks. Our research endeavors to scrutinize existing strategies, discern their limitations, and proffer innovative approaches tailored to optimize the allocation and scheduling of AI workloads within cloud infrastructures. In elucidating the challenges, we pinpoint resource heterogeneity, dynamic workload characteristics, and scalability as the crux of the issues confronting AI-intensive workload management. The diverse computational demands of AI workloads make it challenging to allocate resources optimally, while the dynamic nature of these tasks necessitates adaptive strategies to accommodate varying computational requirements over time. [1] Additionally, as AI models and datasets burgeon in complexity and size, ensuring scalability becomes paramount for sustaining performance in cloud environments. Our literature review encompasses an examination of both traditional and state-of-the-art workload allocation strategies, shedding light on their respective strengths and shortcomings. We also delve into scheduling techniques employed for managing AI-intensive tasks, providing a comprehensive overview of the existing landscape. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework centered around dynamic resource provisioning, machine learning-based scheduling, and efficient task migration strategies. The framework aims to adaptively allocate resources based on the evolving nature of AI workloads, leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict workload characteristics and employing efficient task migration to handle workload fluctuations. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation of the proposed strategies, conducted in a simulated environment using diverse datasets. Key performance metrics, such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization, are employed to assess the effectiveness of our strategies compared to existing approaches. By offering insights into the efficient management of AI-intensive workloads in cloud infrastructures, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the scalability and performance of cloud environments in the face of burgeoning AI applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nActive petrophysical geosteering in reservoir formations has become a very promising practice and commonplace to improve express formation evaluation and maximize hydrocarbon production from reservoirs. The present study showcases the effectiveness of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) framework to process resistivity logging while drilling (LWD) data for the purpose of real-time optimizing well trajectories and maximizing hydrocarbon production in pay zones during drilling horizontal section.\nWe introduce a novel framework that automatically adjusts planned well trajectories during horizontal drilling. The framework takes the planned wellbore trajectory, reservoir model porosity, and ultra-deep resistivity LWD data as input. Hydrocarbon saturation volume is then calculated using the Archie equation. Subsequently, optimization algorithms correct the planned trajectory to maximize wellbore production using hydrocarbon saturation volume. The framework delivers an optimal wellbore trajectory performing real-time formation evaluation, guiding the drill bit through highly saturated pay zones.\nThe proposed framework was tested on a 2D synthetic dataset using various optimization algorithms, including reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action spaces (PPO, DDPG, TwinDDPG) and Q-learning and evolutionary algorithms. The evolutionary group of optimization algorithms achieved the highest efficiency with baseline hyperparameter settings, improving cumulative oil saturation per drilled meter by up to 32.5%. Reinforcement learning algorithms needs to be further explored because they have promising results but still high computational complexity. The evolutionary algorithm was then verified on a 3D Groningen field dataset, determining optimal hyperparameters such as differential evolution strategy, population size, mutational constant, and maximum number of iterations. The framework improved cumulative oil saturation per drilled meter by up to 6%, significantly increasing the average number of penetrated hydrocarbon-saturated pay zones along the drilling path.\nThe developed AI-based framework presents an innovative approach for real-time automatic correction of well drilling trajectories, maximizing well productivity. This method can significantly aid in the interpretation and optimization of decision-making related to geosteering.",

The genetic algorithms (GA) and evolution strategies (ES) are methods to solving optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. Our goal was to use evolutionary optimization methods to find the global optimal value (minimum) of a non-smooth multi-dimensional function with a large number of local minimums. We took several test functions of different levels of complexity and used evolution strategies to solve the problem. The standard evolution strategies, which work well with smooth functions, gave us various points of local minimums as a solution, without finding the global minimum, for the complex function. In our work, we propose a new approach: the cross-selection method, which, in combination with previously developed methods - adaptive evolution strategies, gave a good result for the searth for the global minimum the complex function.",

        "abstract": "We present a method, including tool support, for bibliometric mining of trends in large and dynamic research areas. The method is applied to the machine learning research area for the years 2013 to 2022. A total number of 398,782 documents from Scopus were analyzed. A taxonomy containing 26 research directions within machine learning was defined by four experts with the help of a Python program and existing taxonomies. The trends in terms of productivity, growth rate, and citations were analyzed for the research directions in the taxonomy. Our results show that the two directions, Applications and Algorithms, are the largest, and that the direction Convolutional Neural Networks is the one that grows the fastest and has the highest average number of citations per document. It also turns out that there is a clear correlation between the growth rate and the average number of citations per document, i.e., documents in fast-growing research directions have more citations. The trends for machine learning research in four geographic regions (North America, Europe, the BRICS countries, and The Rest of the World) were also analyzed. The number of documents during the time period considered is approximately the same for all regions. BRICS has the highest growth rate, and, on average, North America has the highest number of citations per document. Using our tool and method, we expect that one could perform a similar study in some other large and dynamic research area in a relatively short time.",

Characterizing the joint-level mechanisms behind these reductions in energy cost can lead to a better understanding of how people interact with these devices, as well as to improved device design and training protocols. We examined the biomechanical responses to exoskeleton assistance in exoskeleton users trained with a lengthened protocol. Kinematics at unassisted joints were generally unchanged by assistance, which has been observed in other ankle exoskeleton studies. Peak plantarflexion angle increased with plantarflexion assistance, which led to increased total and biological mechanical power despite decreases in biological joint torque and whole-body net metabolic energy cost. Ankle plantarflexor activity also decreased with assistance. Muscles that act about unassisted joints also increased activity for large levels of assistance, and this response should be investigated over long-term use to prevent overuse injuries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered a vital factor that will fundamentally alter the cybersecurity environment. AI technology is progressing much faster than expected, and AI-based security services are being introduced into the global security market on a daily basis. However, how AI can contribute to the cybersecurity field and what changes it will bring remain unknown. Nonetheless, cybersecurity is not merely a technical issue but also a process for dealing with regulations, policies, and security risks; therefore, the introduction of AI technology introduction can make a fundamental difference in cybersecurity policy as a whole. This study primarily aims to better understand the concept and characteristics of AI from the cybersecurity perspective and identify its future implications on cybersecurity environment at the national policy level. This study predicts what modifications will be made to national cybersecurity strategies (NCSS) when machine learning (ML) is introduced and implemented. It also provides a basic policy recommendation that offers potential responses to these changes. The study first describes the emergence of AI in the cybersecurity field and explains AI-ML technical services and AI security policy elements. Second, through NCSS material analysis, this study categorizes NCSS into 11 categories and selects the critical functions of each dimension. Finally, it predicts the changes that will occur when AI is introduced within the selected NCSS category. It also introduces the priorities and considerations required for these changes.",

The major drawbacks in currect technologies are threads due to the creation of false trust values and data congestion. Maximum of the concept of WSNs primarily needs security and optimization. So, we are in the desire to develop a new model which is highly secured and localized. In this paper, we introduced a novel approach namely multi level trust calculation with improved ant colony optimization (MLT-IACO). This approach mainly sub-divided into two sections they are multi level trust calculation which is the combination three levels of trust such as direct trust, indirect trust and random repeat trust. Secondly, improved ant colony optimization technique is used to find the optimal path in the network. By transmitting the data in the optimal path, the congestion and delay of the network is reduced which leads to increase the efficiency. The outcome values are comparatively analyzed based the parameters such as packet delivery ratio, network throughput and average latency. While compared with the earlier research our MLT-IACO approach produce high packet delivery ratio and throughput as well as lower latency and routing overhead.",

The main conclusion of the study is the substantiation of the position that the people of Azerbaijan, which regained its independence, used the rich traditions of the short-term activities of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and, on this historical continuity, created a national and people's republic, the sovereign state of Azerbaijan. The author also argues that the Parliament established during this period played a major role in the formation of the statehood based on democratic principles since 1918–1920 was a period of formation of the political consciousness of the Azerbaijani people, a high level of formation and activity of the processes of national identity of the Azerbaijani people. This study is one of the first to examine the origins of the practice of parliamentarism in Azerbaijan in the early twentieth century and its peculiarities.",

The historiographical components of the formation and institution of the civil service were identified, and the objective principles and significant differences in its developmental periodization were characterized. The methodological framework of this research was based on the institutional and structural methods, normative-legal description of events, the method of communicative support of historical consequences and facts, the functional and structural methods, and the professional and cultural substantiation of historical and state-building results. It was demonstrated that the progressive and complex development of the civil service system accompanied the physical development of the state. The research confirmed that the civil service and governance system received a significant impetus during the period of convergence and subsequent integration with the Russian Empire. The article proves that significant changes in the civil service system were introduced by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is determined that the institutional framework of the civil service appeared in Ukraine between 1917 and 1921 due to the activities of Hetman Petro Skoropadskyi. The authors substantiated the pathways and prospective consequences of modernizing and developing the civil service of independent Ukraine.",

New DLSFs progressively encapsulate mathematical, statistical and computational complexity. Such higher levels of abstraction subsequently make it easier for deep learning methodology to spread through mimesis (i.e., imitation of models perceived as successful). In this study, we quantify this increase in abstraction and discuss its implications. Analyzing publicly available code from Github, we found that the introduction of DLSFs correlates both with significant increases in the number of deep learning projects and substantial reductions in the number of lines of code used. We subsequently discuss and argue the importance of abstraction in deep learning with respect to ephemeralization, technological advancement, democratization, adopting timely levels of abstraction, the emergence of mimetic deadlocks, issues related to the use of black box methods including privacy and fairness, and the concentration of technological power. Finally, we also discuss abstraction as a symptom of an ongoing technological metatransition.",

        "abstract": "The aerodynamic configuration of large swept-back tri-wings is generally adopted for hypersonic vehicles, but the structural stiffness of the ailerons is weak, which may lead to damage due to the flutter behavior. In the initial stage of structural design, studying the flutter characteristics of tri-wing flight vehicles is necessary and can provide the stiffness index of the tri-wing structural design. To assess the flutter characteristics of tri-wing flight vehicles efficiently, a rapid modeling technique of the finite element method was used in this paper. For the structural scheme of large swept-back tri-wing flight vehicles, a structural dynamic model was modeled using the rapid modeling technique, the unsteady aerodynamic was computed using the double-lattice method, and the flutter characteristics were analyzed using the P-K method. Variable parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the stiffness of the aileron skin, the stiffness of the control mechanism, and the mass distribution of the aileron on the flutter characteristics of large swept-back tri-wing flight vehicles. The results showed that the key flutter coupling modes of such vehicles are symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations of aileron rotation and torsion. Additionally, optimizing the control mechanism stiffness and mass distribution of the aileron could improve the flutter boundary, which can be helpful in the structural design of such vehicles. The flutter optimization technique effectively improved the flutter boundary, significantly enlarged the flight envelope, and accurately provided the stiffness index for the structural design of large swept-back tri-wing flight vehicles.",

        "abstract": "In light of recent geopolitical developments, Europe and Poland are acutely aware of the urgent importance of infrastructure security. Despite heightened interest and increased investments, our security resources remain severely limited, rendering continuous protection for every potential target unattainable. Consequently, the strategic allocation of security resources becomes an ongoing imperative. This paper presents a short introduction to the core principles behind advanced methods that facilitate automated decision-making in security resource allocation. These methods leverage artificial intelligence (AI), game theory, and optimization techniques, and have demonstrated their effectiveness through multiple real-life deployments in the USA. We also provide a concise overview of this exciting body of research and discuss the solutions and software developed by our team, “AI for Security” at the IDEAS NCBR research institute to protect critical infrastructure in Poland and in Europe.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid information threats under the conditions of modern development of digital technologies are currently becoming one of the major issues for a modern democracy. The amount of damage that hybrid threats bring to the world economy contributes to the establishment of effective legal mechanisms to combat them. The purpose of the study was to single out the information security strategies under conditions of hybrid threats, including the spread of disinformation and fake news. The application of the comparative analysis method mad it possible to identify the gaps in information security strategies for countering hybrid threats. The strategy of information security in the conditions of hybrid threats is a coordinated action plan aimed at countering and fighting hybrid threats to safeguard cyberspace and preserve a democracy. Information security against hybrid threats is based on such cornerstones as: availability, confidentiality, integrity of information data, and safety. Enhancement of information security under the conditions of hybrid threats should be carried out at the expense of digital transformation, increasing the level of digital literacy of society and establishing a fair responsibility measure for a purposeful spreading of disinformation. The perspective of further research is addressing information security strategies as well as elaborating practical guidelines for the formation of a secure information space.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is causing a paradigm shift in coding practices and software solutions across diverse fields. This study focuses on harnessing the potential of ML/DL strategies in the geospatial domain, where geodata possesses characteristics that align with the concept of a “lingual manuscript” in aesthetic theory. By employing ML/DL techniques, such as feature evaluation and extraction from 3D point clouds, we can derive concepts that are specific to software, geographical areas, and tasks. ML/DL-based interpretation of 3D point clouds extends geospatial modelling beyond implicit representations, enabling the resolution of complex heuristic-based reconstructions and abstract concepts. These advancements in artificial intelligence have the potential to optimize and expedite geodata computation and geographic information systems. However, ML/DL encounters notable challenges in this domain, including the need for abundant training data, advanced statistical methods, and the development of effective feature representations. Overcoming these challenges is essential to enhance the performance and efficacy of ML/DL systems. Additionally, ML/DL-based solutions can simplify software engineering processes by replacing certain aspects of current adoption and implementation practices, resulting in reduced complexities in development and management. Through the adoption of ML/DL, many of the existing explicitly coded GIS implementations may gradually be replaced in the long term. Overall, this research illustrates the transformative capabilities of ML/DL in geospatial applications and underscores the significance of addressing associated challenges to drive further advancements in the field.",

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been exploited to propose efficient handwritten digit recognition approaches. However, the CNN model may need an optimization algorithm to achieve satisfactory performance. In this work, a performance evaluation of seven optimization methods applied in a straightforward CNN architecture is presented. The inspected algorithms are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptive gradient (AdaGrad), adaptive delta (AdaDelta), adaptive moment estimation (ADAM), maximum adaptive moment estimation (AdaMax), nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam), and root mean square propagation (RMSprop). Experiments have been carried out on two standard digit datasets, namely Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and Extended MNIST (EMNIST). The results have shown the superior performance of RMSprop and Adam algorithms over the peer methods, respectively.</p>",

        "abstract": "<span lang=\"EN-US\">This paper explores the use of deep learning to optimize the performance of a peer-to-peer energy system with an intelligent master controller. The goal addresses inefficiencies caused by energy seasonality by predicting hourly power consumption through a deep learning algorithm. The intelligent master controller was designed to manage the collaborative energy system, and the deep learning technique was employed as an optimization scheme to forecast power system performance for more efficient utilization. The deep learning algorithm was trained using dataset from American electric power, where consumer load data serves as input, and forecasted power serves as output. The forecasted power was then used as input to the intelligent master controller, which determines suitable power supply for generation and storage based on the predicted demand. The experiment results show promising accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1819 for hourly energy consumption averaged over a year, 0.2419 for hourly energy consumption averaged over a month, 0.0662 for hourly energy consumption averaged per day, and 0.0217 for hourly energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that the system is well-trained and capable of accurately predicting the energy required by the intelligent master controller, thus enhancing the overall performance of the peer-to-peer energy system.</span>",

        "abstract": "White blood cells play a role in maintaining the immune system which consists of several types such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. MobileNetV2 is one of the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models that provides excellent advantages and performance in classifying images. In this research was conducted to find out how to apply optimization hyperparameters and the impact of image processing on white blood cell image classification using MobileNetV2, so that it is expected to find a combination of preprocessing and combination of hyperparameter values that can produce the highest accuracy value. To maximize the classification process, before classifying the image, several stages of image preprocessing are carried out, namely cropping, grayscale, resizing and augmentation. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out for an experiment to improve model performance. The three main parameters used in hyperparameter tuning are learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Performance optimization model performance will be measured using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and using a confusion matrix. Based on the experimental results in this study, it shows that the best learning rate value is 0.00001, the best batch size value is 32, and the best epoch value is 250.",
