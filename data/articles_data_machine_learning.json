        "abstract": "This chapter’s goal is to show how to apply machine learning algorithms in a general setting using some classic methods. In particular, it demonstrates how to apply three important machine learning algorithms, a support vector classifier (SVC), a random forest classifier (RFC), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). While many of the methods studied later go beyond these now classic methods, this does not mean that these methods are obsolete. Also, the algorithms discussed here provide some form of baseline to discuss advanced methods like probabilistic reasoning and deep learning. The aim here is to demonstrate that applying machine learning methods based on machine learning libraries is not very difficult. It offers an opportunity to discuss evaluation techniques that are very important in practice.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is involved in search, translation, detecting depression, likelihood of college dropout, finding lost children, and to sell all kinds of products. While barely beyond its inception, the current machine learning revolution will affect people and organizations no less than the Industrial Revolution’s effect on weavers and many other skilled laborers. Machine learning will automate hundreds of millions of jobs that were considered too complex for machines ever to take over even a decade ago, including driving, flying, painting, programming, and customer service, as well as many of the jobs previously reserved for humans in the fields of finance, marketing, operations, accounting, and human resources. This section explains how automated machine learning addresses exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model diagnostics. The section covers the eight criteria considered essential for AutoML to have significant impact: accuracy, productivity, ease of use, understanding and learning, resource availability, process transparency, generalization, and recommended actions.\n",

        "abstract": "The discussion here considers a much more common learning condition where an agent, such as a human or a robot, has to learn to make decisions in the environment from simple feedback. Such feedback is provided only after periods of actions in the form of reward or punishment without detailing which of the actions has contributed to the outcome. This type of learning scenario is called reinforcement learning. This learning problem is formalized in a Markov decision-making process with a variety of related algorithms. The second part of this chapter will use function approximators with neural networks which have made recent progress as deep reinforcement learning.",

        "abstract": "No-code machine learning (ML) tools provide an avenue for individuals who lack advanced ML skills to develop ML applications. Extant literature indicates that by using such tools, individuals can acquire relevant ML skills. However, no explanation has been provided of how the use of no-code ML tools leads to the generation of these skills. Using the theory of technology affordances and constraints, this article undertakes a qualitative evaluation of publicly available no-code ML tools to explain how their usage can lead to the formation of relevant ML skills. Subsequently, the authors show that no-code ML tools generate familiarization affordances, utilization affordances, and administration affordances. Subsequently, they provide a conceptual framework and process model that depicts how these affordances lead to the generating of ML skills.",

It focuses on the basic elements of these techniques that seem particularly useful for asset pricing and looks at the material on some of those methods in more detail by reviewing asset pricing applications. Supervised learning methods can be grouped into two categories: classification and regression methods. The chapter explains that classification methods are used in settings where the dependent variable y is categorial, while regression methods deal with continuous dependent variables. In asset pricing applications, regression problems are more common, although classification methods can also be useful, for example for prediction of binary events like a corporate default.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is exploding, both in research and for industrial applications. This book aims to be a brief introduction to this area given the importance of this topic in many disciplines, from sciences to engineering, and even for its broader impact on our society. This book tries to contribute with a style that keeps a balance between brevity of explanations, the rigor of mathematical arguments, and outlining principle ideas. At the same time, this book tries to give some comprehensive overview of a variety of methods to see their relation on specialization within this area. This includes some introduction to Bayesian approaches to modeling as well as deep learning. Writing small programs to apply machine learning techniques is made easy today by the availability of high-level programming systems. This book offers examples in Python with the machine learning libraries sklearn and Keras. The first four chapters concentrate largely on the practical side of applying machine learning techniques. The book then discusses more fundamental concepts and includes their formulation in a probabilistic context. This is followed by chapters on advanced models, that of recurrent neural networks and that of reinforcement learning. The book closes with a brief discussion on the impact of machine learning and AI on our society.",

        "abstract": "Software defect prediction is a significant activity in every software firm. It helps in producing quality software by reliable defect prediction, defect elimination, and prediction of modules that are susceptible to defect. Several researchers have proposed different software prediction approaches in the past. However, these conventional software defect predictions are prone to low classification accuracy, time-consuming, and tasking. This paper aims to develop a novel multi-model ensemble machine-learning for software defect prediction. The ensemble technique can reduce inconsistency among training and test datasets and eliminate bias in the training and testing phase of the model, thereby overcoming the downsides that have characterized the existing techniques used for the prediction of a software defect. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a new ensemble machine-learning model for software defect prediction using k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization (GLMNet), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Random Forest as base learner. Experiments were conducted using the proposed model on CM1, JM1, KC3, and PC3 datasets from the NASA PROMISE repository using the RStudio simulation tool. The ensemble technique achieved 87.69% for CM1 dataset, 81.11% for JM1 dataset, 90.70% for PC3 dataset, and 94.74% for KC3 dataset. The performance of the proposed system was compared with that of other existing techniques in literature in terms of AUC. The ensemble technique achieved 87%, which is better than the other seven state-of-the-art techniques under consideration. On average, the proposed model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 88.56% for all datasets used for experiments. The results demonstrated that the ensemble model succeeded in effectively predicting the defects in PROMISE datasets that are notorious for their noisy features and high dimensions. This shows that ensemble machine learning is promising and the future of software defect prediction.",

        "abstract": "Investors in financial markets are faced with an abundance of potentially value-relevant information from a wide variety of different sources. In such data-rich, high-dimensional environments, techniques from the rapidly advancing field of machine learning (ML) are well-suited for solving prediction problems. Accordingly, ML methods are quickly becoming part of the toolkit in asset pricing research and quantitative investing. This book examines the promises and challenges of ML applications in asset pricing. Asset pricing problems are substantially different from the settings for which ML tools were developed originally. To realize the potential of ML methods, they must be adapted for the specific conditions in asset pricing applications. Economic considerations, such as portfolio optimization, absence of near arbitrage, and investor learning can guide the selection and modification of ML tools. Beginning with a brief survey of basic supervised ML methods, the book discusses the application of these techniques in empirical research in asset pricing and shows how they promise to advance the theoretical modeling of financial markets. The book presents the exciting possibilities of using cutting-edge methods in research on financial asset valuation.",

There are billions of financial transactions which are taking place and all this data is stored and can be considered as a gold mine of data for many different organizations. No human intelligence can dig in this amount of data to come up with something valuable. This is the reason financial organizations are employing artificial intelligence to come up with new algorithms which can change the way financial transactions are being carried out. Artificial Intelligence can complete the task in a very short period. Artificial intelligence can be used to detect frauds, identify possible attacks, and any other kind of anomalies that may be detrimental for the institution. This paper discusses the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the finance sector.",

It starts with placing the basic concept in its historical context and phrases the learning problem in a simple mathematical term as function approximation as well as in a probabilistic context. In contrast to more traditional models, machine learning can be characterized as non-linear regression in high-dimensional spaces. This chapter points out how diverse subareas such as deep learning and Bayesian networks fit into the scheme of things and motivates further study with some examples of recent progress.",

        "abstract": "An important diagnostic method for diagnosing abnormalities in the human heart is the electrocardiogram (ECG). A large number of heart patients increase the assignment of physicians. To reduce their assignment, an automatic computer detection system is needed. In this study, a computer system for classifying ECG signals is presented. The MIT-BIH, ECG arrhythmia database is used for analysis. After the ECG signal is noisy in the preprocessing stage, the data feature is extracted. In the feature extraction step, the decision tree is used and the support vector machine (SVM) is constructed to classify the ECG signal into two categories. It is normal or abnormal. The results show that the system classifies the given ECG signal with 90% sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Emotions play a primary role in shaping human intelligence. On the other side, for machines, it is impossible to have forms of knowledge that are not programmed, managed, or piloted by humans. Furthermore, for humans, the process of learning is deeply interwoven with the emotional ground of the living condition. And for machines? We could not improve the attitude of learning in digital devices without enhancing their capacity of sensing. There is a wide consensus among scholars that smart devices can learn emotions at different degrees; however, the rising of the emotional wave in digital devices has not yet been explored. Philosophy can feel the gap by investigating whether machines sense and how. The aim of this article is to indicate a zero degree of emotional power in smart devices: this ability does not exist per se but in the interaction with humans. The Onlife world, where the real and the digital are melted together, provides machines with an environment that makes possible the existence of an enlarged sensitivity. Thus, machines also sense in a specific mode.",

        "abstract": "The manual classification of a large amount of textual materials are very costly in time and personnel. For this reason, a lot of research has been devoted to the problem of automatic classification and work on the subject dates from 1960. A lot of text classification software has appeared. For some tasks, automatic classifiers perform almost as well as humans, but for others, the gap is still large. These systems are directly related to machine learning. It aims to achieve tasks normally affordable only by humans. There are generally two types of learning: learning “by heart,” which consists of storing information as is, and learning generalization, where we learn from examples. In this chapter, the authors address the classification concept in detail and how to solve different classification problems using different machine learning techniques. ",

        "abstract": "This chapter looks at many prediction problems in asset pricing that are of high-dimensional nature in a large number of observable variables that could have useful predictive information. For example, in stock return prediction a huge number of variables could potentially be relevant as predictors. It covers firm characteristics from accounting data, signals extracted from textual information in corporate disclosures, variables summarizing the history of price and trading volume, information in media reports, and many other variables that could potentially contain predictive information. The chapter describes the existing literature in asset pricing that has dealt with this high-dimensionality by imposing ad hoc sparsity. Rather than considering large numbers of predictors simultaneously, researchers often consider small sets of predictors in isolation.",

These are models that are aimed to understand the variety of a class such as cars or trees. A generative mode should be able to generate feature vectors for instances of the class they represent, and such models should therefore be able to characterize the class with all its variations. The subject is discussed both in a Bayesian and in a deep learning context, and also within a supervised and unsupervised context. This area is related to important algorithms such as k-means clustering, expectation maximization (EM), naïve Bayes, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAE).",

The student is the targeted group because most students with depression express themselves on social media rather than seeking help from doctors. This app gathers captions and images from the user's personal Instagram profile through web scraping using Instagram private API to check whether or not the posts are depressive. The google cloud dataset supports the captions and pictures analysis performed by the app [6]. Caption sentiment analysis depends on sentiment analysis, and the pictures analysis depends on classifying images by custom labels. The app reports the image and the caption analysis results back to the user. Python is used for the back-end functionality, while Dart and Flutter are used for the front-end. It was tested by 2 experiments, the first experiments returned the feedback of 15 students demonstrates that the program has the capability of detecting depression through the captions with relatively high accuracy. The second experiment of testing the app functionality on the same account demonstrates that the program is stable and consistent. The purpose of the app is to detect depression at an early stage to prevent the condition from worsening.",

        "abstract": "In 2019, the United States established a national task force for coordinating AI strategies across the federal government, industry, and academia in order to promote scientific discovery, economic competitiveness, and national security. In addition, the 2023 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s report indicates that AI has become a global competition. Hence, AI is here to stay and this trend is too important to ignore or downplay. From the incubation and development of AI, the relationship between AI and psychology is symbiotic. As cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists gain more insight into how the brain works, AI has been developed by mimicking human neural pathways. On the other hand, insights derived from AI research can be applied to a variety of subfields in psychology, whereas new social issues emerged from AI applications, such as AI bias, echo chambers, and misuse of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT and Midjourney), led to new research topics in psychology. Further, several schools of thought of AI, such as the connectionist, symbolic, and analogist approaches, heavily borrowed ideas from psychological research. For example, in an attempt to build structural intelligence, connectionists draw an analogy between human neural networks and artificial neural networks. Moreover, AI symbolists subscribe to the notion that the human mental process is a logical production system. Furthermore, prior psychological research indicates that analogical thinking is commonly employed for problem-solving, and this notion became the foundation of example-based machine learning. Similarly, reinforcement learning in AI was inspired by behavioral psychology. Additionally, in line with the findings of developmental psychology that a child learns best through spontaneous discovery, AI researchers believe that setting the deep learning system free will be the most promising research direction. A vast number of pioneers of AI research who devoted efforts to the preceding research agendas are psychologists or received training in psychology, such as Frank Rosenblatt, Allen Newell, John Anderson, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton, whereas some were inspired by cognitive science or neuroscience, such as Fei-Fei Li, Demis Hassabis, and Yann LeCun. In addition, in their work Artificial Psychology: Psychological Modeling and Testing of AI Systems (cited under Artificial Psychology) Crowder and his colleagues examined the bidirectional relationship between artificial intelligence and psychology, focusing on cognitive architectures and artificial emotions. The authors proposed comprehensive mathematical models for cognitive architectures, envisioning an AI system capable of reasoning about emotions, adapting to humans, and constructing knowledge representations based on experiences.",

AutoML, when implemented properly, makes machine learning accessible to most people because it removes the need for years of experience in the most arcane aspects of data science, such as the math, statistics, and computer science skills required to become a top contender in traditional machine learning. Anyone trained in the use of AutoML can use it to test their ideas and support the quality of those ideas during presentations to management and stakeholder groups. Because the requisite investment is one semester-long undergraduate course rather than a year in a graduate program, these tools will likely become a core component of undergraduate programs, and over time, even the high school curriculum.",

Researchers testing asset pricing models look for predictor variables that can forecast return differences between assets or that capture forecastable variation in returns across time. It describes models of credit risk that require predictors of default, including hedging and risk management models that require forecasts of asset return comovement. The chapter reviews technological advances that have led to an explosive growth in the amount of information that is available to investors and analysts. Even if looking at the narrow slice of data that can be extracted from corporate financial reports, the growth in data availability has been staggering.",

This chapter provides historical context to understand how machine learning became pervasive. The introduction reviews social scientific literature about big data, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The following three sections narrate the invention of machine learning between the late 1950s and 1970s, the increasing academic and commercial interest in machine learning during the late 1980s and 1990s, and the machine learning revolution during the 2010s. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of the machine learning revolution in order to understand the digital economy and contemporary capitalism. The chapter argues that sociologists and other social scientists studying the digital economy should expand their focus from competition and profit to also include cooperation and economic activities that are not exclusively driven by profit.",

        "abstract": "This chapter assesses alternative approaches of reinforcement learning that are developed by machine learning. The initial goal of this branch of artificial intelligence, which appeared in the middle of the twentieth century, was to develop and implement algorithms that allow a machine to learn. Originally, they were computers or more or less autonomous robotic automata. As artificial intelligence has developed and cross-fertilized with neuroscience, it has begun to be used to model the learning and decision-making processes for biological agents, broadening the meaning of the word ‘machine’. Theoreticians of this discipline define several categories of learning, but this chapter only deals with those which are related to reinforcement learning. To understand how these algorithms work, it is necessary first of all to explain the Markov chain and the Markov decision-making process. The chapter then goes on to examine model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, the actor-critic model, and finally model-based reinforcement learning algorithms.",

Previous sociological studies that rely on visual information as data either use qualitative interpretation or small-scale quantitative analysis, which is not suitable for large-scale datasets. This chapter first provides a historical overview of automated image analysis using computer vision. It then discusses the state-of-art deep learning algorithms and summarizes the two steps of using deep learning algorithms to automatically analyze large image datasets. It uses various publications using large-scale image datasets ranging from social media images, satellite and street view images, and historical archives to illustrate how automatic image analysis was carried out in recent research. Finally, the chapter discusses ways in which social scientists can better utilize visual information in their future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis chapter shows how interpretive work can reveal sociological discoveries in analyses using machine learning (ML). It proposes integrating ethnographic and quantitative research around a common concern with abduction. The chapter’s main section develops this computational ethnography approach across a series of examples, including computational analyses of historical and contemporary corpora, classic and recent network-analytic studies, and some of the newest ML techniques that are geared toward detecting sources of inequality. Despite technical and substantive differences, the studies’ empirical designs involve settings that resemble fields, in the ethnographic sense, more than representative samples and that reveal local meaning and locally meaningful actions. The chapter argues that this era’s challenges and opportunities call on researchers to cultivate and integrate technical skills, critical reflection on technological infrastructures, and sensitivity to surprising observations in light of existing theories.",

In this article, the fundamental concepts of the spatial audio coding including its techniques, standards, and applications are exhibited. The object-based audio reproduction system will be presented and compared to the traditional channel-based system in order to offer a good understanding of this system to the users and to give them more flexibility in their preferred audio composition. Moreover, the MPEG standard for encoding multi-channel audio signals will be exposed. Machine learning (ML) methods and their applications in acoustics and spatial audio scenes will then be offered. Ultimately, further research directions will be illustrated and discussed.",

Previous sociological studies that rely on visual information as data either use qualitative interpretation or small-scale quantitative analysis, which is not suitable for large-scale datasets. This chapter first provides a historical overview of automated image analysis using computer vision. It then discusses the state-of-art deep learning algorithms and summarizes the two steps of using deep learning algorithms to automatically analyze large image datasets. It uses various publications using large-scale image datasets ranging from social media images, satellite and street view images, and historical archives to illustrate how automatic image analysis was carried out in recent research. Finally, the chapter discusses ways in which social scientists can better utilize visual information in their future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis chapter shows how interpretive work can reveal sociological discoveries in analyses using machine learning (ML). It proposes integrating ethnographic and quantitative research around a common concern with abduction. The chapter’s main section develops this computational ethnography approach across a series of examples, including computational analyses of historical and contemporary corpora, classic and recent network-analytic studies, and some of the newest ML techniques that are geared toward detecting sources of inequality. Despite technical and substantive differences, the studies’ empirical designs involve settings that resemble fields, in the ethnographic sense, more than representative samples and that reveal local meaning and locally meaningful actions. The chapter argues that this era’s challenges and opportunities call on researchers to cultivate and integrate technical skills, critical reflection on technological infrastructures, and sensitivity to surprising observations in light of existing theories.",

In this article, the fundamental concepts of the spatial audio coding including its techniques, standards, and applications are exhibited. The object-based audio reproduction system will be presented and compared to the traditional channel-based system in order to offer a good understanding of this system to the users and to give them more flexibility in their preferred audio composition. Moreover, the MPEG standard for encoding multi-channel audio signals will be exposed. Machine learning (ML) methods and their applications in acoustics and spatial audio scenes will then be offered. Ultimately, further research directions will be illustrated and discussed.",

The chapter further extends the discussion to examine issues of privacy and data collection and the inequalities that emerge around the human work needed to create and sustain highly data-intensive ML tools.

Prior chapters have shown that writing machine learning programs is easy using high-level computer languages and with the help of good machine learning libraries. However, applying such algorithms appropriately with superior performance requires considerable experience and a deeper knowledge of the underlying ideas and algorithms. This chapter takes a step back to consider basic regression in more detail, which in turn will form the foundation for discussing probabilistic models in following chapters. This includes the important discussion of gradient descent as a learning algorithm.",

        "abstract": "To make life better, many mechanisms in modern environment are carried out via the Internet. The economy is expanding yet on the other side, there is a lot of illegal and unauthorised activity carried throughout the country that is seriously hampering that progress. Scam instances, which mislead individuals while also causing economic losses, are just one of them. In realistic conditions, fraud involving credit cards surveillance is the main emphasis of this research. Contrary to earlier eras, the number of credit card scammers is drastically increasing right now. Criminals use various forms of innovation, fake documents, and deception to con others and take their cash. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to discover a solution to these frauds. As technology advances, it becomes harder to keep up with the behaviour and trends of illegal activities. Ai technology, machine learning, as well as other relevant data technology fields have advanced to the point that it is currently feasible to expedite this process and reduce the volume of labour-intensive effort needed in recognizing credit card scams. The user-submitted utilization of credit cards database might be collected initially, then using machine learning approach; it would be split into databases for testing and training purposes. This methodical technique could be utilized by researchers once they have evaluated both the larger information collection and the user-provided available data collection. Enhance the accuracy of the outcome statistics after that. Depending on its exactness and precision, a technology's efficiency is assessed. The results show that XG-Boost and Random Forest techniques have the greatest performance.",

This chapter discusses the brief history of \nmachine learning, its widespread adoption as a de facto feature, and fundamental concepts such \nas supervised and unsupervised learning, regression and classification, and underfitting and \noverfitting. We also emphasize the importance of understanding machine learning through \nnumerical examples, which can bridge the gap between abstract mathematical theories and \npractical applications of machine learning algorithms. By developing a strong foundation in \nmachine learning, readers/students can harness its potential to address challenges and \nopportunities across diverse sectors.",

Existing examination in ML and IoT was centered around discovering how garbage in will convey garbage out, which is extraordinarily suitable for the extent of the enlightening list for machine learning. The quality, aggregate, availability, and decision of data are essential to the accomplishment of a machine learning game plan. Therefore, the point of this section is to give an outline of how the framework can utilize advancements alongside machine learning and difficulties get a kick out of the chance to understand the security challenges IoT can be bolstered. There are a few extensively unmistakable counts open for ML use. In spite of the way that counts can work in any nonexclusive conditions, there are specific standards available about which figuring would work best under which conditions. ",

        "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML) regression tasks is becoming the focus of many studies in materials and chemical science. It is now well understood that average calibration is insufficient, and most studies implement additional methods for testing the conditional calibration with respect to uncertainty, i.e., consistency. Consistency is assessed mostly by so-called reliability diagrams. There exists, however, another way beyond average calibration, which is conditional calibration with respect to input features, i.e., adaptivity. In practice, adaptivity is the main concern of the final users of the ML-UQ method, seeking the reliability of predictions and uncertainties for any point in the feature space. This article aims to show that consistency and adaptivity are complementary validation targets and that good consistency does not imply good adaptivity. An integrated validation framework is proposed and illustrated with a representative example.",

Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and the use of Big Data created by M2M communication have enormous promise for improving road safety. A training dataset-less Deep Learning strategy that uses only a safety model and optimizes it sequentially through M2M learning over time can prevent a lack of suitable Knowledge Base while also improving the capacity to handle unpredictable scenarios. The article outlines an M2M learning model based on in-vehicle sensors that can be used to reduce traffic accidents.",

        "abstract": "The housing market is one of the earliest and most influential industries with interests among general populations. In recent years and with the advent of computer approaches, many studies used the latest machine learning models to analyze the housing market and identify its most important influential variables in order to suggest a proper price or to predict price fluctuations. This article follows the general phases of the CRISP-DM process model for data mining to elaborate on the problem statements, data collection and preparation, modeling, and evaluation. It suggests proper ways to design steady and accurate models in relation to previous methods and approaches for predicting housing prices. Based on this investigation, previous methods suffer from reaching steady results on multiple datasets, which can be largely attributed to the existence of bias in training, as it is essential to predict prices by considering external economic variables.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDigitized text has become a popular form of data for sociologists. But text is also the product of many different social and linguistic processes, a topic traditionally examined by sociolinguists in the case of spoken language. This chapter presents a sociolinguistic perspective as a methodological framework when using machine learning to analyze text data. The chapter describes sociolinguistic theories and approaches to studying language while also highlighting ways that this literature tends to differ from traditional sociology. To exemplify this approach, the chapter analyzes a corpus of college admissions essays written by Latinx-identifying applicants using two popular machine-learning-based methods: topic modeling and word embeddings. Similar to variation in spoken language among constituent groups and ethnicities within the panethnic category (e.g., Mexican, Cuban), written language also varies by subgroup in meaningful ways. A sociolinguistic perspective for computational text analysis could spur theoretical and empirical insights.",

        "abstract": "Skin lesion analysis is a tedious and challenging task, thus, in this research the suitability of employing machine learning or deep learning approaches for automatic lesion segmentation on dermoscopic skin cancer images is determined. The segmented region can assist clinical experts in understanding the complex lesion structure and internal pattern to find the correct skin cancer type for its early diagnosis and prevention. In this study, I present two methodologies for performing lesion segmentation: machine learning-based optimized K-means with Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the first model, the FA is hybridized with K-means clustering based on the novel average intensity fitness function to optimize the segmentation map. It is observed in the experimental results that the K-means algorithm may lead to poor results due to the wrong selection of initial centroid value, thus FA is hybridized into it to improve the performance. The second model is an enhanced encoder-decoder-based CNN framework implemented in an end-to-end fashion. These two models are compared to understand whether machine learning or deep learning is suitable to perform medical image segmentation based on a few performance metrics such as accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and DICE index. These methods are evaluated and compared on two benchmark datasets provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) named ISIC 2016 [1] and ISIC 2017 [2]. Experimental results showed that the CNN model outperformed the machine learning model with an accuracy difference of 7.98% on ISIC 2016, and 7.32% on ISIC 2017. I concluded from the experimental findings that the deep learning model is more accurate and efficient in segmenting the lesion area as compared to the machine learning model. Thus, findings from this experimental work will be considered for the design of an automatic classification system by incorporating a deep learning-based segmentation approach as a pre-processing step. ",

        "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning methods to enhance economic recession prediction in the UK and USA, considering the limitations of traditional methods. Various models, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, Neural Network, RTC, Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, and XGBoost, were assessed using economic data since 1900. The UK data encompassed GDP, unemployment rate, inflation, FTSE 100 index, yield curve, and debt levels, while the USA utilized the 50-day simple moving average of 10-year treasury rates minus the 50-day simple moving average of 3-month treasury rates. Performance evaluation involved averaged F1, recall, and accuracy over 100 iterations, with confusion matrices illustrating model predictions against actual events. Long Short-Term Memory excelled with recall and F1 values of 0.96 and 0.97, accurately identifying 11 in 12 Positive USA events. K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost demonstrated good results, with recall ranging from 0.99 to 0.75, F1 from 1.0 to 0.69, and correctly identifying 2 in 3 Positive events. Conversely, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Neural Network exhibited less reliable predictions. Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Classifier, and Convolutional Neural Network were completely inadequate. Using recent data, most models predicted the USA avoiding recession in 2023-24, but the probability increased to 0.5 by mid-2023, then decreased. Logistical Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Long Short-Term Memory initially predicted no recession, but the probability rapidly increased to between 0.83 and 0.97 by April 2024. While recession avoidance is plausible, modelling indicates an escalating risk. The results underscore the utility of machine learning in recession prediction, emphasizing the importance of diverse training datasets. Algorithmic performance varied, with neural network models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory and XGBoost, proving most accurate. Further enhancements in performance necessitate refining training datasets and leveraging advanced models like Long Short-Term Memory.",

It\ncould be said that anything from cars to household items must be artificially intelligent.\nEveryone needs smartphones, vehicles, and machines. Some kind of intelligence is\nrequired by all at all times. Since computers have become such an integral part of our\nlives, it has become essential to develop new methods of human-computer interaction.\nFinding an intelligent way of machine and user interaction is one of the most crucial\nsteps in meeting the requirement. The motivations for developing artificial intelligence\nand artificial life can be traced back to the dawn of the computer era. As always,\nevolution is a case of shifting phenomena. Adaptive computer systems are explicitly\ndesigned to search for problem-specific solutions in the face of changing\ncircumstances. It has been said before that evolution is a massively parallel quest\nmethod that never works on a single species or a single solution at any given time.\nMany organisms are subjected to experiments and modifications. As a result, this\nwrite-up aims to create Artificial Intelligence, superior to machine learning that can\nmaster these problems, ranging from traditional methods of automatic reasoning to\ninteraction strategies with evolutionary algorithms.

        "abstract": "Search engines allow providing the user with data and information according to their interests and specialty. Thus, it is necessary to exploit descriptions of the resources, which take into consideration viewpoints. Generally, the resource descriptions are available in RDF (e.g., DBPedia of Wikipedia content). However, these descriptions do not take into consideration viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which allows converting a classic RDF resource description to a resource description that takes into consideration viewpoints. To detect viewpoints in the document, a machine learning technique will be exploited on an instanced ontology. This latter allows representing the viewpoint in a given domain. An experimental study shows that the conversion of the classic RDF resource description to a resource description that takes into consideration viewpoints, allows giving very relevant responses to the user’s requests.",

        "abstract": "Supply chains are complex and continuously evolving to become more complex. With globalization of supply chains and ever-increasing customer demands for better service, planning is very important. The vulnerabilities in the supply chain were exposed with COVID-19, and transportation, a key supply chain element, was impacted significantly. Transportation connects various nodes in the supply chain network. There are several nodes, numerous links between nodes, various modes of transportation in addition to people and systems in the network. Ensuring better service for customers is of paramount importance for companies. With disparate systems involved, collecting and harnessing this data can identify problems in the network. Data science techniques, machine learning, and artificial intelligence can help identify service failures in planning even before they happen. Predicting service failures in planning can ensure better service and reduce costs. In this article, the authors use machine learning to predict service failures in domestic transportation planning.",

        "abstract": "Proxy servers used around the globe are typically graded and built for small businesses to large enterprises. This does not dismiss any of the current efforts to keep the general consumer of an electronic device safe from malicious websites or denying youth of obscene content. With the emergence of machine learning, we can utilize the power to have smart security instantiated around the population's everyday life. In this work, we present a simple solution of providing a web proxy to each user of mobile devices or any networked computer powered by a neural network. The idea is to have a proxy server to handle the functionality to allow safe websites to be rendered per request. When a website request is made and not identified in the pre-determined website database, the proxy server will utilize a trained neural network to determine whether or not to render that website. The neural network will be trained on a vast collection of sampled websites by category. The neural network needs to be trained constantly to improve decision making as new websites are visited. ",

        "abstract": "In this chapter, the authors realized prediction applications of concrete compressive strength values via generation of various hybrid models, which are based on decision trees as main a prediction method. This was completed by using different artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. In respect to this aim, the authors presented a literature review. The authors explained the machine learning methods that they used as well as with their developments and structural features. Next, the authors performed various applications to predict concrete compressive strength. Then, the feature selection was applied to a prediction model in order to determine parameters that were primarily important for the compressive strength prediction model. The authors evaluated the success of both models with respect to correctness and precision prediction of values with different error metrics and calculations. ",

        "abstract": "It is difficult to obtain necessary information accurately from Social Networking Service (SNS) while raising children, and it is thought that there is a certain demand for the development of a system that presents appropriate information to users according to the child's developmental stage. There are still few examples of research on knowledge extraction that focuses on childcare. This research aims to develop a system that extracts and presents useful knowledge for people who are actually raising children, using texts about childcare posted on Twitter. In many systems, numbers in text data are just strings like words and are normalized to zero or simply ignored. In this paper, we created a set of tweet texts and a set of profiles created according to the developmental stages of infants from \"0-year-old child\" to \"6-year-old child\". For each set, we used ML algorithms such as NB (Naive Bayes), LR (Logistic Regression), ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor algorithms search), XGboost, RF (random forest), decision trees, and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to compare with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a neural language model, to construct a classification model that predicts numbers from \"0\" to \"6\" from sentences. The accuracy rate predicted by the BERT classifier was slightly higher than that of the NB, LR, and ANN, XGboost, and RF, decision trees and SVM classifiers, indicating that the BERT classification method was better.",

        "abstract": "The only prerequisite in the past era was human intelligence, but today's\nworld is full of artificial intelligence and its obstacles, which must still be overcome. It\ncould be said that anything from cars to household items must be artificially intelligent.\nEveryone needs smartphones, vehicles, and machines. Some kind of intelligence is\nrequired by all at all times. Since computers have become such an integral part of our\nlives, it has become essential to develop new methods of human-computer interaction.\nFinding an intelligent way of machine and user interaction is one of the most crucial\nsteps in meeting the requirement. The motivations for developing artificial intelligence\nand artificial life can be traced back to the dawn of the computer era. As always,\nevolution is a case of shifting phenomena. Adaptive computer systems are explicitly\ndesigned to search for problem-specific solutions in the face of changing\ncircumstances. It has been said before that evolution is a massively parallel quest\nmethod that never works on a single species or a single solution at any given time.\nMany organisms are subjected to experiments and modifications. As a result, this\nwrite-up aims to create Artificial Intelligence, superior to machine learning that can\nmaster these problems, ranging from traditional methods of automatic reasoning to\ninteraction strategies with evolutionary algorithms. The result is evaluated with a piece\nof code for predicting optimal test value after learning.",

This data is updated periodically by collecting the information from the sensors placed at the monitoring stations of different regions. A model using artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to predict the AQI values based on the present and previous values of the pollutants. The ANN model processes the normalized data and predicts whether the region is hazardous or not. A novel mobile application which could be used by the user to know about the present and future pollution level could be developed using a progressive web application development environment. This mobile application uses the location information of the user and helps the user to predict the hazardous level of the pollutants in that particular location. ",

        "abstract": "The housing market is one of the earliest and most influential industries with interests among general populations. In recent years and with the advent of computer approaches, many studies used the latest machine learning models to analyze the housing market and identify its most important influential variables in order to suggest a proper price or to predict price fluctuations. This article follows the general phases of the CRISP-DM process model for data mining to elaborate on the problem statements, data collection and preparation, modeling, and evaluation. It suggests proper ways to design steady and accurate models in relation to previous methods and approaches for predicting housing prices. Based on this investigation, previous methods suffer from reaching steady results on multiple datasets, which can be largely attributed to the existence of bias in training, as it is essential to predict prices by considering external economic variables.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDigitized text has become a popular form of data for sociologists. But text is also the product of many different social and linguistic processes, a topic traditionally examined by sociolinguists in the case of spoken language. This chapter presents a sociolinguistic perspective as a methodological framework when using machine learning to analyze text data. The chapter describes sociolinguistic theories and approaches to studying language while also highlighting ways that this literature tends to differ from traditional sociology. To exemplify this approach, the chapter analyzes a corpus of college admissions essays written by Latinx-identifying applicants using two popular machine-learning-based methods: topic modeling and word embeddings. Similar to variation in spoken language among constituent groups and ethnicities within the panethnic category (e.g., Mexican, Cuban), written language also varies by subgroup in meaningful ways. A sociolinguistic perspective for computational text analysis could spur theoretical and empirical insights.",

This data is updated periodically by collecting the information from the sensors placed at the monitoring stations of different regions. A model using artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to predict the AQI values based on the present and previous values of the pollutants. The ANN model processes the normalized data and predicts whether the region is hazardous or not. A novel mobile application which could be used by the user to know about the present and future pollution level could be developed using a progressive web application development environment. This mobile application uses the location information of the user and helps the user to predict the hazardous level of the pollutants in that particular location. ",

This research aims to develop a system that extracts and presents useful knowledge for people who are actually raising children, using texts about childcare posted on Twitter. In many systems, numbers in text data are just strings like words and are normalized to zero or simply ignored. In this paper, we created a set of tweet texts and a set of profiles created according to the developmental stages of infants from \"0-year-old child\" to \"6-year-old child\". For each set, we used ML algorithms such as NB (Naive Bayes), LR (Logistic Regression), ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor algorithms search), XGboost, RF (random forest), decision trees, and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to compare with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a neural language model, to construct a classification model that predicts numbers from \"0\" to \"6\" from sentences. The accuracy rate predicted by the BERT classifier was slightly higher than that of the NB, LR, and ANN, XGboost, and RF, decision trees and SVM classifiers, indicating that the BERT classification method was better.",

        "abstract": "Due to technological advancements, humans are able to produce more food than ever before. In fact, the food production level is so high that all population could be supported if the food resource is distributed correctly. Yet, it is more than common to see items left expiring on the supermarket shelves, wasting the food resource that could otherwise be useful. Neither are the adverse impacts on the climate due to food disposal in anyone’s favor or interest. This paper proposes an application to identify the stock status of supermarket items, specifically food items, so that supermarket managers can react to the selling status and prevent oversupply. The key tool implemented in the application is computer vision, specifically YOLOv5, which uses convolutional neural networks [1]. The model automatically recognizes and counts the items in a taken picture. We applied our computer vision model to numerous supermarket shelf photos and conducted an evaluation of the model’s precision and speed. The results show that the application is a useful tool for users to log supermarket stock information since the computer vision model, despite lacking slightly in object detection precision, can return a reliable count for well-taken photos. As a platform where such information is shared, the application is therefore a viable tool for store managers to import amounts of food accordingly and for the public to be informed and make smart buying choices.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last ten years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpus. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that: a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries, b) the reviewed publication can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, SVM), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical and modelling (continuous), c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships. From these findings, we found research gaps, in particular: about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.\n                        ",

Some of these interactions are intentional; others are unintentional or even against practitioners’ concerted efforts. Some are born out of the allure of a seemingly simple variable that is aligned with the technical needs of ML. Often, gender lurks without invitation, because these methods mine data for associations, and gendered associations are ubiquitous. In a growing body of work, scholars are using ML to actively interrogate measurements and theories of gender and sex. ML brings with it new paradigms of quantitative reasoning that hold the potential to either reinscribe or revolutionize gender in both technical systems and scientific knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis chapter discusses the wide array of ways that gender and sex interact with machine learning (ML) and the artificial intelligence technologies that rely on it. Some of these interactions are intentional; others are unintentional or even against practitioners’ concerted efforts. Some are born out of the allure of a seemingly simple variable that is aligned with the technical needs of ML. Often, gender lurks without invitation, because these methods mine data for associations, and gendered associations are ubiquitous. In a growing body of work, scholars are using ML to actively interrogate measurements and theories of gender and sex. ML brings with it new paradigms of quantitative reasoning that hold the potential to either reinscribe or revolutionize gender in both technical systems and scientific knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWe define a neural network as a septuple consisting of (1) a state vector, (2) an input projection, (3) an output projection, (4) a weight matrix, (5) a bias vector, (6) an activation map and (7) a loss function. We argue that the loss function can be imposed either on the boundary (i.e. input and/or output neurons) or in the bulk (i.e. hidden neurons) for both supervised and unsupervised systems. We apply the principle of maximum entropy to derive a canonical ensemble of the state vectors subject to a constraint imposed on the bulk loss function by a Lagrange multiplier (or an inverse temperature parameter). We show that in an equilibrium the canonical partition function must be a product of two factors: a function of the temperature, and a function of the bias vector and weight matrix. Consequently, the total Shannon entropy consists of two terms which represent, respectively, a thermodynamic entropy and a complexity of the neural network. We derive the first and second laws of learning: during learning the total entropy must decrease until the system reaches an equilibrium (i.e. the second law), and the increment in the loss function must be proportional to the increment in the thermodynamic entropy plus the increment in the complexity (i.e. the first law). We calculate the entropy destruction to show that the efficiency of learning is given by the Laplacian of the total free energy, which is to be maximized in an optimal neural architecture, and explain why the optimization condition is better satisfied in a deep network with a large number of hidden layers. The key properties of the model are verified numerically by training a supervised feedforward neural network using the stochastic gradient descent method. We also discuss a possibility that the entire Universe at its most fundamental level is a neural network.",

This section is about modeling data, using data to train algorithms to create models that can be used to predict future events or understand past events. The section shows where data modeling fits in the overall machine learning pipeline. Traditionally, we store real-world data in one or more databases or files. This data is extracted, and features and a target (T) are created and submitted to the “Model Data” stage (the topic of this section). Following the completion of this stage, the model produced is examined (Section V) and placed into production. With the model in the production system, present data generated from the real-world environment is inputted into the system. In the example case of a diabetes patient, we enter a new patient’s information electronic health record into the system, and a database lookup retrieves additional data for feature creation.",

From late 2020 until early 2021, the project produced a machine learning proof of concept, later implemented in the gamification start-up´s application programming interface to offer smart gamification. The initial results show promise in using prediction models to automate the cluster model selection affording more functional, autonomous, and scalable user segments that are faster to implement. The finding provides opportunities for gamification (e.g., in learning analytics and health informatics). An identified challenge was performance; the neural networks required hyperparameter fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. Interesting further investigations should consider the neural network fine-tuning process, but also attempt to verify the effectiveness of the cluster models selection compared with a control group.",

        "abstract": "This chapter presents the theory and procedures behind supervised machine learning and how genetic programming can be applied to be an effective machine learning algorithm. Due to simple and powerful concept of computer programs, genetic programming can solve many supervised machine learning problems, especially regression and classifications. The chapter starts with theory of supervised machine learning by describing the three main groups of modelling: regression, binary, and multiclass classification. Through those kinds of modelling, the most important performance parameters and skill scores are introduced. The chapter also describes procedures of the model evaluation and construction of confusion matrix for binary and multiclass classification. The second part describes in detail how to use genetic programming in order to build high performance GP models for regression and classifications. It also describes the procedure of generating computer programs for binary and multiclass calcification problems by introducing the concept of predefined root node. ",

        "abstract": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has revolutionized our ability to explore the nanoscale world, enabling the imaging, manipulation, and characterization of materials at the atomic and molecular level. However, conventional SPM techniques suffer from limitations, such as slow data acquisition, low signal-to-noise ratio, and complex data analysis. In recent years, the field of machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex datasets and extracting meaningful patterns and features in multiple fields. The combination of ML with SPM techniques has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of conventional SPM methods and unlock new opportunities for nanoscale research. In this review article, we will provide an overview of the recent developments in ML-based SPM, including its applications in topography imaging, surface characterization, and secondary imaging modes, such as electrical, spectroscopic, and mechanical datasets. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating ML with SPM techniques and highlight the potential impact of this interdisciplinary field on various fields of science and engineering.",

        "abstract": "At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, naïve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets.",

        "abstract": "Identifying/classifying damage features on soft materials, such as tissues, is much more challenging than on classical, hard materials—but nevertheless important, especially in the field of bio-tribology. For instance, cartilage samples from osteoarthritic patients exhibit surface damage even at early stages of tissue degeneration, and corneal tissues can be damaged by contact lenses when the ocular lubrication system fails. Here, we employ unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods to assess the surface condition of a soft tissue by detecting and classifying different wear morphologies as well as the severity of surface damage they represent. We show that different clustering methods, especially a k-means clustering algorithm, can indeed achieve a—from a material science point of view—meaningful classification of those tissue samples. Our study pinpoints the ability of unsupervised ML models to guide or even replace human decision processes for the analysis of complex surfaces and topographical datasets that—either owing to their complexity or the sample size—exceed the capability of the human brain.",

        "abstract": "The grand goal of Machine Learning is to develop software which can learn from previous experience—similar to how we humans do. Ultimately, to reach a level of usable intelligence, we need (1) to learn from prior data, (2) to extract knowledge, (3) to generalize—i.e., guessing where probability function mass/density concentrates, (4) to fight the curse of dimensionality, and (5) to disentangle underlying explanatory factors of the data—i.e., to make sense of the data in the context of an application domain. To address these challenges and to ensure successful machine learning applications in various domains an integrated machine learning approach is important. This requires a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative, cross-domain, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary work of experts from seven sections, ranging from data pre-processing to data visualization, i.e., to map results found in arbitrarily high dimensional spaces into the lower dimensions to make it accessible, usable and useful to the end user. An integrated machine learning approach needs also to consider issues of privacy, data protection, safety, security, user acceptance and social implications. This paper is the inaugural introduction to the new journal of MAchine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (MAKE). The goal is to provide an incomplete, personally biased, but consistent introduction into the concepts of MAKE and a brief overview of some selected topics to stimulate future research in the international research community.",

It begins with empirical applications of machine learning (ML) tools, noting that part of the challenge in empirical work is to sort out how to select and tweak ML methods to be most useful in asset pricing applications. Some progress has been made, but many questions remain about economically appropriate methods of regularization, the role of nonlinearities, and how to deal with structural change in the underlying data-generating process. The chapter discusses areas where application of ML methods seems promising and fall into the area of asset demand analysis. It offers some suggestions on how asset pricing theory could advance by adopting ML as a model of investor belief formation in high-dimensional environments.",

Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and the use of Big Data created by M2M communication have enormous promise for improving road safety. A training dataset-less Deep Learning strategy that uses only a safety model and optimizes it sequentially through M2M learning over time can prevent a lack of suitable Knowledge Base while also improving the capacity to handle unpredictable scenarios. The article outlines an M2M learning model based on in-vehicle sensors that can be used to reduce traffic accidents.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWe have seen that stochastic processes play an important foundational role in a wide range of methods in DSP. For example, we treat a discrete-time signal as a Gaussian process, and thereby obtain many mathematically simplified algorithms, particularly based on the power spectral density. At the same time, in machine learning, it has generally been observed that nonparametric methods outperform parametric methods in terms of predictive accuracy since they can adapt to data with arbitrary complexity. However, these techniques are not Bayesian so we are unable to do important inferential procedures such as draw samples from the underlying probabilistic model or compute posterior confidence intervals. But, Bayesian models are often only mathematically tractable if parametric, with the corresponding loss of predictive accuracy. An alternative, discussed in this section, is to extend the mathematical tractability of stochastic processes to Bayesian methods. This leads to so-called Bayesian nonparametrics exemplified by techniques such as Gaussian process regression and Dirichlet process mixture modelling that have been shown to be extremely useful in practical DSP and machine learning applications.",

        "abstract": "Data analytics is the process of performing scientific and statistical analysis on raw data in order to transform it into information that can be used for gaining knowledge. A recently emerging trend in feature abstraction is the combination of computational techniques and big data analysis. This requires gaining knowledge from trustworthy data sources, being able to digest information quickly, and making accurate predictions about the future. The primary objective of this study is to locate the machine learning strategies that produce the most accurate prediction by utilising the model that has been proposed. The supervised and unsupervised strategies have been implemented in a variety of different ways using the MapReduce methodology; however, the suggested model makes use of the Apache Spark framework in order to compare the many existing methods. In this study, the emphasis is placed on elucidating the characteristics of datasets in order to conduct the most accurate analysis possible using machine learning techniques. For the purpose of conducting an analysis of the data sets, machine learning methods such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting tree algorithms are utilised. In light of the findings of this research, it is possible to draw the conclusion that when the Spark framework is applied on top of Machine Learning methods, the efficiency of the model is improved by a factor of seventy percent in comparison to the MapReduce paradigm.

First, it provides a brief overview of applications of topology to machine learning and knowledge extraction, as well as the motivations thereof. Furthermore, this paper is aimed at promoting cross-talk between the theoretical and applied domains of topology and machine learning research. Such interactions can be beneficial for both the generation of novel theoretical tools and finding cutting-edge practical applications.",

Some of these interactions are intentional; others are unintentional or even against practitioners’ concerted efforts. Some are born out of the allure of a seemingly simple variable that is aligned with the technical needs of ML. Often, gender lurks without invitation, because these methods mine data for associations, and gendered associations are ubiquitous. In a growing body of work, scholars are using ML to actively interrogate measurements and theories of gender and sex. ML brings with it new paradigms of quantitative reasoning that hold the potential to either reinscribe or revolutionize gender in both technical systems and scientific knowledge.",

The 3rd annual Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology Machine Learning Competition sought to find ML models for personnel selection that could balance the best of ML prediction with the constraint of minimizing selection bias based on race and gender. To test the possible advantages of simple rules over ML algorithms, we entered a simple and explainable rule-based model inspired by recent advances in model comparison. This simple model outperformed most ML models entered and was comparable to the top performers while retaining positive qualities such as explainability and transparency.",

        "abstract": "SafePredict is a novel meta-algorithm that works with any base prediction algorithm for online data to guarantee an arbitrarily chosen correctness rate, 1−ϵ, by allowing refusals. Allowing refusals means that the meta-algorithm may refuse to emit a prediction produced by the base algorithm on occasion so that the error rate on non-refused predictions does not exceed ϵ. The SafePredict error bound does not rely on any assumptions on the data distribution or the base predictor. When the base predictor happens not to exceed the target error rate ϵ, SafePredict refuses only a finite number of times. When the error rate of the base predictor changes through time SafePredict makes use of a weight-shifting heuristic that adapts to these changes without knowing when the changes occur yet still maintains the correctness guarantee. Empirical results show that (i) SafePredict compares favorably with state-of-the art confidence based refusal mechanisms which fail to offer robust error guarantees; and (ii) combining SafePredict with such refusal mechanisms can in many cases further reduce the number of refusals. Our software (currently in Python) is included in the supplementary material.",

        "abstract": "Enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (FabI) is a key enzyme in the fatty acid metabolism of gram-positive bacteria and is considered a potential target for new antibacterial drugs development. Indeed, triclosan is a widely employed antibacterial and AFN-1252 is currently under phase-II clinical trials, both are known as FabI inhibitors. Nowadays, there is an urgent need for new drug discovery due to increasing antibacterial resistance. In the present study, classification models using machine learning techniques were generated to distinguish SaFabI inhibitors from non-inhibitors successfully (e.g., Mathews correlation coefficient values equal to 0.837 and 0.789 calculated with internal and external validations). The interpretation of a selected model indicates that larger compounds, number of N atoms and the distance between central amide and naphthyridinone ring are important to biological activity, corroborating previous studies. Therefore, these obtained information and generated models can be useful for design/discovery of novel bioactive ligands as potential antibacterial agents. ",

        "abstract": "Phosphate contamination in surface water is a common problem that still needs a dependable solution because the presence of phosphate is the main motivator of the eutrophication of surface water which leads to many economic and health problems. In terms of the economy, eutrophication ruins the quality of the water inhibits tourism activities and requires expensive treatments and management plans. While in terms of health, eutrophication results in the generation of toxins via algal activities. The present article presents the results of phosphate removal from water using an electrocoagulation unit supplied with aluminium electrodes, and also it presents the results of modelling of phosphate removal by the electrocoagulation method. The experimental work focused on the effects of distance between electrodes (D), current density (CD) and contact time (Time), and the modelling process was developed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) (a three-factor Box-Behnken design). The results of both experimental and modelling studies were agreed with an R2 of 0.9779, and it was noticed that the 20 mg/L of phosphate was removed after 55 minutes of electrolysing at CD of 5 mA/cm2 and D of 3 mm. The results encourage the use of this method for phosphate removal from domestic wastewater or use the method as a pre-treatment for industrial wastewater because the latter is usually highly loaded with phosphate.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic materials are used in a variety of applications, such as electric generators, speakers, hard drives, MRI machines, etc. Discovery of new magnetic materials with desirable properties is essential for advancement in these applications. In this research article, we describe the development and validation of a machine-learning model to discover new manganese-based stable magnetic materials. The machine learning model is trained on the input data from the Materials Project database to predict the magnetization and formation energy of the materials. New hypothetical structures are made using the substitution method, and the properties are predicted using the machine learning model to select the materials with desired properties. Harnessing the power of machine learning allows us to intelligently narrow down the vast pool of potential candidates. By doing so, we deftly reduce the number of materials that warrant in-depth examination using density functional theory, rendering the task more manageable and efficient. The selected materials, seemingly promising with their magnetic potential, undergo a meticulous validation process using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package, grounded in density functional theory. Our results underscore the paramount significance of input data in the efficacy of the machine learning model. Particularly in the realm of magnetic materials, the proper initialization of atomic magnetic spins holds the key to converging upon the true magnetic state of each material.",

MRI depicts an important part of the pathology of this disease and therefore plays a key part in diagnosis and disease monitoring. Still, major challenges exist with regard to the differential diagnosis, adequate monitoring of disease progression, quantification of CNS damage, and prediction of disease progression. Machine learning techniques have been employed in an attempt to overcome these challenges. This chapter aims to give an overview of how machine learning techniques are employed in MS with applications for diagnostic classification, lesion segmentation, improved visualization of relevant brain pathology, characterization of neurodegeneration, and prognostic subtyping.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning provides the system to automatically learn without human intervention and improve their performance with the help of previous experience. It can access the data and use it for learning by itself. Even though many algorithms are developed to solve machine learning issues, it is difficult to handle all kinds of inputs data in-order to arrive at accurate decisions. The domain knowledge of statistical science, probability, logic, mathematical optimization, reinforcement learning, and control theory plays a major role in developing machine learning based algorithms. The key consideration in selecting a suitable programming language for implementing machine learning algorithm includes performance, concurrence, application development, learning curve. This chapter deals with few of the top programming languages used for developing machine learning applications. They are Python, R, and Java. Top three programming languages preferred by data scientist are (1) Python more than 57%, (2) R more than 31%, and (3) Java used by 17% of the data scientists. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSociologists are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling. ML methods help classify data, compute new measures, predict outcomes and events, make causal inferences, and collaborate within a common-task framework. Although predictive analytics has become a mainstay of public policy analysis and evaluation, the contributions of ML to theory building are less widely appreciated. ML-derived data classifications can reveal patterns that require a new theory, while predictive performance metrics can point to shortcomings of existing theory and motivate inductive theorizing. ML equips research analysts to venture outside the “general linear reality” of classical statistics and the deductive framing of much social science research. Both quantitative and qualitative sociologists also scrutinize ML applications by industry and government to reveal implications for distributive justice, social inequality, and algorithmic bias. In short, ML is now an integral part of sociological inquiry as a discovery-enabling analytical tool as well as a controversial object of study.",

With the trending use of Blockchain technology emerging in client-based applications, there has been a call for the empowerment of Metaverse applications through the combination of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. This research paper aims to propose strategies for addressing the security concerns and the user-friendliness of Metaverse applications by fusing Blockchain technology with Machine Learning concepts like Linear Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Recommender Systems. The first proposed strategy aims to enhance security and predict malicious attacks on Blockchain user transactions in Metaverse worlds through Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Networks. The second proposed strategy pursues the creation of a Content-Based Filtering Recommendation System of Blockchain assets for Metaverse users to purchase. The expected outcome will result in a more secure and intelligent Metaverse world for user participation.",

Although there are many ways to find a summary of a film or a book, having an app that generates needed information according to the genre will make things much more manageable. This paper develops a mobile app named Book and Movie Search that uses API or the online database to generalize data such as authors, plots, overview, and more with a few clicks. The results show that within seconds, a list of information will show according to movies and books, and a qualified way to find information using the Book And Movie Search app. For example, if one decided to buy a book named Flipped and did not have time to finish the whole book, he can enter the name on the app. It will generate a book summary that quickly gives him more information about it and help him decide whether he wishes to make the purchase.",

Heart sound monitoring or phonocardiogram (PCG) is a non-invasive assessment that can be performed during routine exams. PCG can provide valuable details for both heart disorder diagnosis as well as any perioperative cardiac monitoring. Further, heart murmurs are abnormal signals generated by turbulent blood flow in the heart and are closely associated with specific heart diseases.  This paper presents a new machine learning-based heart sounds evaluation for murmurs with high accuracy. A random forest classifier is built using the statistical moments of the coefficients extracted from the heart sounds. The classifier can predict the location of the heart sounds with over 90% accuracy. The random forest classifier has a murmur detection accuracy of over 70% for test dataset and detects with over 98% accuracy for the full dataset.",

        "abstract": "SafePredict is a novel meta-algorithm that works with any base prediction algorithm for online data to guarantee an arbitrarily chosen correctness rate, 1−ϵ, by allowing refusals. Allowing refusals means that the meta-algorithm may refuse to emit a prediction produced by the base algorithm on occasion so that the error rate on non-refused predictions does not exceed ϵ. The SafePredict error bound does not rely on any assumptions on the data distribution or the base predictor. When the base predictor happens not to exceed the target error rate ϵ, SafePredict refuses only a finite number of times. When the error rate of the base predictor changes through time SafePredict makes use of a weight-shifting heuristic that adapts to these changes without knowing when the changes occur yet still maintains the correctness guarantee. Empirical results show that (i) SafePredict compares favorably with state-of-the art confidence based refusal mechanisms which fail to offer robust error guarantees; and (ii) combining SafePredict with such refusal mechanisms can in many cases further reduce the number of refusals. Our software (currently in Python) is included in the supplementary material.",

        "abstract": "Phosphate contamination in surface water is a common problem that still needs a dependable solution because the presence of phosphate is the main motivator of the eutrophication of surface water which leads to many economic and health problems. In terms of the economy, eutrophication ruins the quality of the water inhibits tourism activities and requires expensive treatments and management plans. While in terms of health, eutrophication results in the generation of toxins via algal activities. The present article presents the results of phosphate removal from water using an electrocoagulation unit supplied with aluminium electrodes, and also it presents the results of modelling of phosphate removal by the electrocoagulation method. The experimental work focused on the effects of distance between electrodes (D), current density (CD) and contact time (Time), and the modelling process was developed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) (a three-factor Box-Behnken design). The results of both experimental and modelling studies were agreed with an R2 of 0.9779, and it was noticed that the 20 mg/L of phosphate was removed after 55 minutes of electrolysing at CD of 5 mA/cm2 and D of 3 mm. The results encourage the use of this method for phosphate removal from domestic wastewater or use the method as a pre-treatment for industrial wastewater because the latter is usually highly loaded with phosphate.",

Indeed, triclosan is a widely employed antibacterial and AFN-1252 is currently under phase-II clinical trials, both are known as FabI inhibitors. Nowadays, there is an urgent need for new drug discovery due to increasing antibacterial resistance. In the present study, classification models using machine learning techniques were generated to distinguish SaFabI inhibitors from non-inhibitors successfully (e.g., Mathews correlation coefficient values equal to 0.837 and 0.789 calculated with internal and external validations). The interpretation of a selected model indicates that larger compounds, number of N atoms and the distance between central amide and naphthyridinone ring are important to biological activity, corroborating previous studies. Therefore, these obtained information and generated models can be useful for design/discovery of novel bioactive ligands as potential antibacterial agents. ",

Although there are many ways to find a summary of a film or a book, having an app that generates needed information according to the genre will make things much more manageable. This paper develops a mobile app named Book and Movie Search that uses API or the online database to generalize data such as authors, plots, overview, and more with a few clicks. The results show that within seconds, a list of information will show according to movies and books, and a qualified way to find information using the Book And Movie Search app. For example, if one decided to buy a book named Flipped and did not have time to finish the whole book, he can enter the name on the app. It will generate a book summary that quickly gives him more information about it and help him decide whether he wishes to make the purchase.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSociologists are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) for data-driven discovery and predictive modeling. ML methods help classify data, compute new measures, predict outcomes and events, make causal inferences, and collaborate within a common-task framework. Although predictive analytics has become a mainstay of public policy analysis and evaluation, the contributions of ML to theory building are less widely appreciated. ML-derived data classifications can reveal patterns that require a new theory, while predictive performance metrics can point to shortcomings of existing theory and motivate inductive theorizing. ML equips research analysts to venture outside the “general linear reality” of classical statistics and the deductive framing of much social science research. Both quantitative and qualitative sociologists also scrutinize ML applications by industry and government to reveal implications for distributive justice, social inequality, and algorithmic bias. In short, ML is now an integral part of sociological inquiry as a discovery-enabling analytical tool as well as a controversial object of study.",

Heart sound monitoring or phonocardiogram (PCG) is a non-invasive assessment that can be performed during routine exams. PCG can provide valuable details for both heart disorder diagnosis as well as any perioperative cardiac monitoring. Further, heart murmurs are abnormal signals generated by turbulent blood flow in the heart and are closely associated with specific heart diseases.  This paper presents a new machine learning-based heart sounds evaluation for murmurs with high accuracy. A random forest classifier is built using the statistical moments of the coefficients extracted from the heart sounds. The classifier can predict the location of the heart sounds with over 90% accuracy. The random forest classifier has a murmur detection accuracy of over 70% for test dataset and detects with over 98% accuracy for the full dataset.",

Riset tersebut membuat basis informasi yang ada sebagian foto ekspresi wajah yang bertujuan buat menolong riset di bidang computer vision tentang ekspresi mikro. Dalam pelaksanaanya penelitian MicroExpression ini berhenti dalam pengembanganya dan tidak berlanjut untuk kemudian dikembangkan dalam penelitian berikutnya. Kinship ialah salah satu sebutan“ kekerabatan” dalam salah satu spesies. Tujuan dari pemodelan kinship ini merupakan buat memastikan apakah 2 orang saling terhubung dan saling terikat (bersaudara) Sebagian besar metode kekerabatan yang ada mengasumsikan bahwa setiap pasangan citra dengan citra wajah positif (dengan citra yang menegaskan kekerabatan) memiliki skor yang lebih besar untuk kelompok citra kekerabatan non-negatif. Dalam penelitian ini penulis mengembangkan penelitian mengenai MicroExpression ini untuk dikembangkan dalam penelitian di bidang Kinship atau hubungan kekerabatan, dengan menggunakan MicroExpression sebagai parameternya dan menggunakan citra mulut sebagai ekstraksi khusus dalam pengambilan citra pada parameter Microexpressionya, dengan menggunakan beberapa fitur dan metode yakni klasifikasi dengan Extreme Learning Machine dan ekstraksi fitur dengan Color Features menghasilkan beberapa hasil nilai akurasi pada ELM dan Microexpression berturut-turut yakni 80,06% dan 76,31%.",

It describes the representation of knowledge assumed by each of these approaches and reviews basic algorithms for inducing such representations from annotated training examples and using the acquired knowledge to classify future instances. It also briefly reviews unsupervised learning, in which new concepts are formed from unannotated examples by clustering them into coherent groups. These techniques can be applied to learn knowledge required for a variety of problems in computational linguistics ranging from part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing to word sense disambiguation and anaphora resolution. Applications to a variety of these problems are reviewed.",

        "abstract": "The cyber physical system safety and security is the major concern on the incorporated components with interface standards, communication protocols, physical operational characteristics, and real-time sensing. The seamless integration of computational and distributed physical components with intelligent mechanisms increases the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems. In IoT-enabled cyber physical systems, cyber security is an essential challenge due to IoT devices in industrial control systems. Computational intelligence algorithms have been proposed to detect and mitigate the cyber-attacks in cyber physical systems, smart grids, power systems. The various machine learning approaches towards securing CPS is observed based on the performance metrics like detection accuracy, average classification rate, false negative rate, false positive rate, processing time per packet. A unique feature of CPS is considered through structural adaptation which facilitates a self-healing CPS. ",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, emergency department services are confronted to an increasing demand. This situation causes emergency department overcrowding which often increases the length of stay of patients and leads to strain situations. To overcome this issue, emergency department managers must predict the length of stay. In this work, the researchers propose to use machine learning techniques to set up a methodology that supports the management of emergency departments (EDs). The target of this work is to predict the length of stay of patients in the ED in order to prevent strain situations. The experiments were carried out on a real database collected from the pediatric emergency department (PED) in Lille regional hospital center, France. Different machine learning techniques have been used to build the best prediction models. The results seem better with Naive Bayes, C4.5 and SVM methods. In addition, the models based on a subset of attributes proved to be more efficient than models based on the set of attributes. ",

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes uncontrollable movements and difficulty with balance and coordination. It is highly important for early detection of Parkinson’s disease in order for patients to receive proper treatment. This paper aims to aid in the early detection of Parkinson’s disease by using a convolutional neural network for PD detection from drawing movements. This CNN consists of 2 convolutional layers, 2 max-pooling layers, 2 dropout layers, 2 dense layers, and a flattened layer. Additionally, our approach explores multiple types of drawings, specifically spiral, meander, and wave datasets hand-drawn by patients and healthy controls to find the most effective one in the discrimination process. The models can be continuously trained in which the test data can be inputted to differentiate between healthy controls and PD patients. By analyzing the training and validation accuracy and loss, we were able to find the most appropriate model and dataset combination, which was the spiral drawing with an accuracy of 85%. With a proper model and a larger dataset for increased accuracy, this approach has the potential to be implemented in a clinical setting.",

Yet these tools have remained largely separate in practice. This chapter draws on a growing body of scholarship that argues that ethnography and machine learning can be usefully combined, particularly for large comparative studies. Specifically, this paper (a) explains the value (and challenges) of using machine learning alongside qualitative field research for certain types of projects, (b) discusses recent methodological trends to this effect, (c) provides examples that illustrate workflow drawn from several large projects, and (d) concludes with a roadmap for enabling productive coevolution of field methods and machine learning.",

This chapter aims to dissect the notion of ML power, intended both as power to and power over. First, two complementary scholarly perspectives on ML power to, here labeled “networked” and “cultural” views, are presented and critically discussed. Second, drawing on both classic and contemporary social theories, the chapter outlines four main dimensions of ML power over—as opaque coercion, computational authority, structural conditioning, and data-driven governmentality.",

It also briefly reviews unsupervised learning, in which new concepts are formed from unannotated examples by clustering them into coherent groups. These techniques can be applied to learn knowledge required for a variety of problems in computational linguistics ranging from part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing to word sense disambiguation and anaphora resolution. Applications to a variety of these problems are reviewed.",

The seamless integration of computational and distributed physical components with intelligent mechanisms increases the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems. In IoT-enabled cyber physical systems, cyber security is an essential challenge due to IoT devices in industrial control systems. Computational intelligence algorithms have been proposed to detect and mitigate the cyber-attacks in cyber physical systems, smart grids, power systems. The various machine learning approaches towards securing CPS is observed based on the performance metrics like detection accuracy, average classification rate, false negative rate, false positive rate, processing time per packet. A unique feature of CPS is considered through structural adaptation which facilitates a self-healing CPS. ",

In this work, the researchers propose to use machine learning techniques to set up a methodology that supports the management of emergency departments (EDs). The target of this work is to predict the length of stay of patients in the ED in order to prevent strain situations. The experiments were carried out on a real database collected from the pediatric emergency department (PED) in Lille regional hospital center, France. Different machine learning techniques have been used to build the best prediction models. The results seem better with Naive Bayes, C4.5 and SVM methods. In addition, the models based on a subset of attributes proved to be more efficient than models based on the set of attributes. ",

        "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes uncontrollable movements and difficulty with balance and coordination. It is highly important for early detection of Parkinson’s disease in order for patients to receive proper treatment. This paper aims to aid in the early detection of Parkinson’s disease by using a convolutional neural network for PD detection from drawing movements. This CNN consists of 2 convolutional layers, 2 max-pooling layers, 2 dropout layers, 2 dense layers, and a flattened layer. Additionally, our approach explores multiple types of drawings, specifically spiral, meander, and wave datasets hand-drawn by patients and healthy controls to find the most effective one in the discrimination process. The models can be continuously trained in which the test data can be inputted to differentiate between healthy controls and PD patients. By analyzing the training and validation accuracy and loss, we were able to find the most appropriate model and dataset combination, which was the spiral drawing with an accuracy of 85%. With a proper model and a larger dataset for increased accuracy, this approach has the potential to be implemented in a clinical setting.",

        "abstract": "The information technologies currently used in plant and fish farming are largely based on equipment and mechanism, image processing, and pattern acknowledgement, computerized modelling, geographical information systems, expert systems (Pakar), data supervision, artificial intelligence (AI), decision maker devices, and care centres or links. The use of advanced technologies eases the prediction and prevention of parasite infestation and other disease outbreaks. The food productivity of the food sources, including plants and fish, is limited by diseases. The early detection of the disease’s infection by naked eyes is somehow difficult. Therefore, early detection through different image processing tools has been introduced widely. Due to the increasing number of reported paper on the potential use of data quarrying and types of machine learning (ML) for plant and fish disease prediction, this chapter consolidates and presents scientific information on the application of data mining and ML in both types of diseases and discussed how imaging technology can be applied to study the diseases and the method in the detection, with comprehensions on the different encounters and prospects. In addition, the potential application of ML in terms of plant and fish disease discoveries in Indonesia are put forward.",

        "abstract": "Advances in digital technology have led to the digitization of everyday activities of billions of people around the world, generating vast amounts of data on human behavior. A parallel trend has been the emergence of computational methods and analysis techniques needed to deal with these new sources of behavioral data—which tend to be more unstructured, of much larger scale, and noisier. As they are recent and emerging developments, many behavioral scientists and practitioners may be unaware or unfamiliar with these recent developments and opportunities to extract behavioral insights. The main objective of this article is to discuss machine learning methods for researchers and practitioners interested in addressing customer-relevant questions using new secondary data sources that are publicly available, such as data from crowdfunding, video streaming, crowdsourcing, and social media platforms. This article offers a primer on the application of computational social science for understanding consumer data for researchers and practitioners.",

        "abstract": "Having evaluated all the measures and selected the best model for this case, and much of the machine learning process has been clarified, our understanding of the problem context is still relatively immature. That is, while we have carefully specified the problem, we still do not fully understand what drives that target. Convincing management to support the implementation of the model typically includes explaining the answers to “why,” “what,” “where,” and “when” questions embedded in the model. While the model may be the best overall possible model according to selected measures, for the particular problem related to hospital readmissions, it is still not clear why the model predicts the readmission of some patients will be readmitted and that others will not. It also remains unknown what features drive these outcomes, where the patients who were readmitted come from, or whether or not this is relevant. In this case, access to time information is also unavailable––when, so it is not relevant, but it is easy to imagine that patients admitted in the middle of the night might have worse outcomes due to tired staff or lack of access to the best physicians. If we can convince management that the current analysis is useful, we can likely also make a case for the collection of additional data. The new data might include more information on past interactions with this patient, as well as date and time information to test the hypothesis about the effect of time-of-admission and whether the specific staff caring for a patient matters.",

The current journey of insurance industry is conquered by data collection to make future decisions since this is the digital era of the insurance industry in its journey of 700+ years. This chapter focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant and critical factors to develop business strategy as well as to predict customers' responses in cross-sell health insurance. Response is either acceptance or rejection of a health insurance product offered to existing customers, who may or may not hold policies with the company. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) presents data analysis and visualization from various lookouts to characterize data that can help the insurer in strategic decision making.",

        "abstract": "Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations are one of the most important theoretical tools to study fundamental processes, such as photosynthesis or vision, but they are seriously limited by the expense of the underlying quantum chemistry calculations. Long nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations are out of reach when based on conventional ab initio methods, and the exploration of rare reaction channels is limited due to bad statistics. Here, the aforementioned limitations are circumvented by using machine learning models that can learn the relationship between a molecular structure and its photochemical properties computed with quantum chemistry in order to simulate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics on long time scales with ab initio accuracy. A central goal is to describe and highlight the challenges that arise when treating excited states and to provide a guide on how to generate a training set in a most efficient way. The machine learning models need to learn not only energies and forces but also couplings between the different electronic states. The photodynamics of a test system, the methylenimmonium cation, CH2NH2+, is used to show that machine learning models can accurately reproduce and speed up nonadiabatic dynamics simulations and can go beyond the abilities of conventional approaches to make long time scales in the range of nanoseconds possible. The chapter is focused on neural networks, but it provides a comparison of different types of regressors and representations to tackle excited-state properties.",

        "abstract": "<p>This paper applies machine learning to modeling power magnetics. We first introduce an open-source database - MagNet - which hosts a large amount of experimentally measured excitation data for many materials across a variety of operating conditions. The processes for data acquisition and data quality control are explained. We then demonstrate a few neural network-based power magnetics modeling tools for modeling core losses and B–H loops. Machine learning allows the many factors that may influence the magnetic characteristics being modeled in a unified framework, and provides insights to quantify the complexity of magnetic characteristics and reduce the size of the measurement data required to build a precise model. Neural network models are found effective in compressing the measurement data and predicting the behaviors of magnetic materials such as the core loss and the B–H loop. The behaviors of a typical power magnetic material (e.g., TDK N87) across a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., temperature, waveform, dc-bias) can be well described by a small-scale neural network (200 KB) which is 10,000 times smaller than the raw measured time-series data (2 GB), paving the way toward using neural networks as an interactive datasheet to assist magnetics design.</p>",

Technol.\n3 045005) presented a kernel ridge regression model to predict reaction barrier heights. Here, we comment on the utility of that model and present references and results that contradict several statements made in that article. Our primary interest is to offer a broader perspective by presenting three aspects that are essential for researchers to consider when creating models for chemical kinetics: (1) are the model’s prediction targets and associated errors sufficient for practical applications? (2) Does the model prioritize user-friendly inputs so it is practical for others to integrate into prediction workflows? (3) Does the analysis report performance on both interpolative and more challenging extrapolative data splits so users have a realistic idea of the likely errors in the model’s predictions?",

Although materials are more complex than small organic molecules, ML approaches have shown impressive results in predicting the properties of materials for application in diverse fields like 2D photonics, porous materials for energy and environmental applications, and in the development of biomaterials and regenerative medicine therapies. Here, we summarize some of the challenges in ML modelling of materials and highlight some exciting recent applications.",

        "abstract": "For a long time, people have been trying to find a way to retrieve information from a large text database. Convert data into information we need. In current search engines, when we search about something rather than giving the precise answer it takes out keywords from our search and gives us documents or web pages related to those words but what we want is the exact answer, why does the user have to search for it. That is, search engines deal more with whole document retrieval. However, a user often wants an exact or specific answer to the question. For instance, given the question \"When is Holi festival this year?\", what he wants is the answer \"March 9, 2022\", rather than to read through lots of web pages that contain the words \"Holi\", \"festival\", \"year\", etc. to find the date of the festival. That is, what a user needs is information retrieval, rather than current document retrieval. We handle the task of answering questions, where the answers are in documents in an extensive text database. We take on a machine learning technique to answer questions. In particular, answer candidates are classified and ranked by a classifier trainee donaset of question-answerpairs.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid screening of promising candidate functional materials.",

        "abstract": "A concise overview of machine learning—computer programs that learn from data—the basis of such applications as voice recognition and driverless cars.\nToday, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition—as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis for a new approach to artificial intelligence that aims to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Ethem Alpaydın offers a concise and accessible overview of “the new AI.” This expanded edition offers new material on such challenges facing machine learning as privacy, security, accountability, and bias.\nAlpaydın, author of a popular textbook on machine learning, explains that as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. He describes the evolution of the field, explains important learning algorithms, and presents example applications. He discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns to take actions to maximize reward. In a new chapter, he considers transparency, explainability, and fairness, and the ethical and legal implications of making decisions based on data.",

        "abstract": "Having evaluated all the measures and selected the best model for this case, and much of the machine learning process has been clarified, our understanding of the problem context is still relatively immature. That is, while we have carefully specified the problem, we still do not fully understand what drives that target. Convincing management to support the implementation of the model typically includes explaining the answers to “why,” “what,” “where,” and “when” questions embedded in the model. While the model may be the best overall possible model according to selected measures, for the particular problem related to hospital readmissions, it is still not clear why the model predicts the readmission of some patients will be readmitted and that others will not. It also remains unknown what features drive these outcomes, where the patients who were readmitted come from, or whether or not this is relevant. In this case, access to time information is also unavailable––when, so it is not relevant, but it is easy to imagine that patients admitted in the middle of the night might have worse outcomes due to tired staff or lack of access to the best physicians. If we can convince management that the current analysis is useful, we can likely also make a case for the collection of additional data. The new data might include more information on past interactions with this patient, as well as date and time information to test the hypothesis about the effect of time-of-admission and whether the specific staff caring for a patient matters.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid screening of promising candidate functional materials.",

        "abstract": "<p>This paper applies machine learning to modeling power magnetics. We first introduce an open-source database - MagNet - which hosts a large amount of experimentally measured excitation data for many materials across a variety of operating conditions. The processes for data acquisition and data quality control are explained. We then demonstrate a few neural network-based power magnetics modeling tools for modeling core losses and B–H loops. Machine learning allows the many factors that may influence the magnetic characteristics being modeled in a unified framework, and provides insights to quantify the complexity of magnetic characteristics and reduce the size of the measurement data required to build a precise model. Neural network models are found effective in compressing the measurement data and predicting the behaviors of magnetic materials such as the core loss and the B–H loop. The behaviors of a typical power magnetic material (e.g., TDK N87) across a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., temperature, waveform, dc-bias) can be well described by a small-scale neural network (200 KB) which is 10,000 times smaller than the raw measured time-series data (2 GB), paving the way toward using neural networks as an interactive datasheet to assist magnetics design.</p>",

        "abstract": "The reason trends in prevalent detection of EEG seizure help in analyzing the various features of EEG signals to customize and to remove visual inspection in reading the EEG signals. Epilepsy is a disorder and is identified by baseless seizures that have been associated with unexpected improper neural discharges which result in various health issues and also result in death. One of the most common methods in detecting contraction seizures is an electroencephalogram. By using machine learning methods, it is easy to extract the features of EEG signals that help in detecting seizures. Convolutional neural network (CNN) includes both inputs as well as output layers that help in training the data acquired since it helps in analyzing the large set of high dimensional data. The performance analysis is done under multiple classifiers such as random forest, gradient boosting, and decision tree, which are used in feature extraction. Among them, random forest proves to be the best classifier in achieving a high degree of accuracy. ",

        "abstract": "Stock market movements are affected by numerous factors making it one of the most challenging problems for forecasting. This article attempts to predict the direction of movement of stock and stock indices. The study uses three classifiers - Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine with four different representation of inputs. First representation uses raw data (open, high, low, close and volume), The second uses ten features in the form of technical indicators generated by use of technical analysis. The third and fourth portrayal presents two different ways of converting the indicator data into discrete trend data. Experimental results suggest that for raw data support vector machine provides the best results. For other representations, there is no clear winner regarding models applied, but portrayal of data by the proposed approach gave best overall results for all the models and financial series. Consistency of the results highlight the importance of feature generation and right representation of dataset to machine learning techniques. ",

        "abstract": "With the exponential rise in technological awareness in the recent decades, technology has taken over our lives for good, but with the application of computer-aided technological systems in various domains of our day-to-day lives, the potential risks and threats have also come to the fore, aiming at the various security features that include confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, and so on. Computer scientists the world over have tried to come up, time and again, with solutions to these impending problems. With time, attackers have played out complicated attacks on systems that are hard to comprehend and even harder to mitigate. The very fact that a huge amount of data is processed each second in organizations gave birth to the concept of Big Data, thereby making the systems more adept and intelligent in dealing with unprecedented attacks on a real-time basis. This chapter presents a study about applications of machine learning algorithms in cyber security. ",

Based on a real use case, the article first provides an approach for the methodical procedure for the implementation of ETA predictions and a description of essential development phases. Subsequently, a cross-actor prediction approach for the combined road-rail transport of containers in the port hinterland is designed, and ML-based prediction models for specific logistics processes are prototypically implemented and evaluated. Finally, an outlook on future research directions is given.",

Despite the fact that breast cancer affects men also, pervasiveness is lower in men than women. This is the reason breast cancer is such a vital concern among ladies. Roughly 80% of cancer malignancies emerge from epithelial cells inside breast tissues. In breast cancer spectrum, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) are considered malignant cancers that need treatment and care. This chapter mainly deals with breast cancer and machine learning (ML) applications. All through this chapter, different issues related to breast cancer prognosis and early detection and diagnostic techniques using various ML algorithms are addressed. ",

        "abstract": "Summary\nIn recent decades, the fields of statistical and machine learning have seen a revolution in the development of data-adaptive regression methods that have optimal performance under flexible, sometimes minimal, assumptions on the true regression functions. These developments have impacted all areas of applied and theoretical statistics and have allowed data analysts to avoid the biases incurred under the pervasive practice of parametric model misspecification. In this commentary, I discuss issues around the use of data-adaptive regression in estimation of causal inference parameters. To ground ideas, I focus on two estimation approaches with roots in semi-parametric estimation theory: targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE; van der Laan and Rubin, 2006) and double/debiased machine learning (DML; Chernozhukov and others, 2018). This commentary is not comprehensive, the literature on these topics is rich, and there are many subtleties and developments which I do not address. These two frameworks represent only a small fraction of an increasingly large number of methods for causal inference using machine learning. To my knowledge, they are the only methods grounded in statistical semi-parametric theory that also allow unrestricted use of data-adaptive regression techniques.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMachine learning software is fundamentally different from most other software in one important respect: it is tightly linked with data. The behavior of machine learning software is dictated as much by the data we train our models on as it is by our design choices because the information in the data is compiled into the software through the models. In a sense, models program the software automatically: developers do not completely encode its behavior in the code. Combining this idea with modern software development schools such as Agile and DevOps into MLOps has shaped how we develop and run software that incorporates probabilistic models in real‐world applications. In this article, we provide a brief overview of commonly accepted best practices for developing such software, focusing on the unique challenges that require a combination of statistical and software engineering expertise to tackle.",

        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic millions of people were affected due to quarantine and restrictions. With more than half of the world's population active on social media, people resorted to these platforms as their outlet for emotions. This led to researchers analysing content on social media to detect depression by studying the patterns of content posting. This paper focuses on finding a data-driven metric called ‘Happiness Factor’ of a user to assess their mental health. Various models were trained to classify a post as ‘depressed’. A user’s ‘Happiness Factor’ was calculated based on the nature of their posts. This metric identifies degrees of depression of a user. The results show the effectiveness of the classifier in identifying the depression level. Also, a Mental Health Awareness Resource System is proposed which recommends mental health awareness resources to users on their social media interface based on their ‘Happiness Factor’.",

Digital Marketing is a way of maintaining relationships with customers for your business through a way of an online medium.  Digital Marketing has made the lives of local businesses a lot easier as a target audience can be reached very easily with just a bare touch of technology. Earlier in the days, Traditional Marketing was the only way for the Businesses to promote their products and services which was done by magazines, newspapers, billboards and with the word of mouth, it was capable of doing the bare minimum publicity. Introduction of Digital marketing has paved a way to reach to a wider, broader and the exact specific target audience. Local businesses are flourishing due to the aid of this type of marketing and machine learning plays a huge role in it.",

Naming is a fragment of language and can be an identifier as it contains patterns that could be learned in order to classify individual’s gender based on their names (first name and middle name). In this paper a multi-national, multi-ethnicity and multi-language names (first name) based classification or guessing of gender is per-formed by popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Recent advancements of various Artificial Intelligence inspired algorithms offer various options for text classification. This paper investigates first name based gender identification on a dataset of 84,899 first names and middle name initials with gender labels. The algorithms tested on this task are Support Vector Classifications (linear and non-linear), Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and a simple embedding based deep learning model (SimpleText). Among the models the significant results out of this study is that linear model (94.62%) performs equivalent with the complex machine learning models and the simple embedding based deep learning network SimpleText outperforms (94.67%) all the models, even the other Recurrent and Convolutional networks </p>",

Most people nowadays suffer from one or more chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, heart disease, breast cancer, and dermatology. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these chronic illnesses account for half of all fatalities in most nations and are the main cause of premature mortality. Patients who are identified early on potentially have their condition stop progressing. Many dispersed studies clearly demonstrated that conventional approaches to diagnosing chronic illnesses are prone to prejudice and heterogeneity among physicians, making it difficult to promptly and precisely diagnose problems. Still, Despite the availability of up-to-date information and a variety of machine learning-based methods, there have been enormous published efforts demonstrating that machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) based approach can considerably enhance the timely estimation of various health conditions. However, precise diagnosis of such diseases remains a difficulty. There are many machine learning-based techniques and current knowledge available, however despite this, a great deal of published research has shown that machine learning/deep learning based approach can considerably enhance the timely estimation of various health conditions. However, precise diagnosis of such diseases remains a difficulty. In order to tackle this problem, this work uses the UCI/KAGGLE ML/DL disease dataset to evaluate various ML/DL procedures and explores how different machine learning algorithms forecast chronic diseases. Accuracy and confusion matrix are used to verify the results. In order to help inexperienced researchers comprehend the disease prediction function of ML/DL-based techniques and determine the direction of Upcoming research, this study also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of accessible disease prediction schemes.",

Artificial neural networks, static and dynamic, with various configurations, used individually or aggregated in stack, are presented in different types of applications: direct and inverse modeling, soft sensors, or optimal control. A particular aspect is represented by neuro-evolution, by combining neural networks with evolutionary algorithms (genetic algorithms and differential evolution), with applications in determining optimal neural models or in optimizing chemical processes. In most cases, the selected examples, many of which are the author's own contributions, show the gradual improvement in performance of the applied method. Polymerization processes were chosen as case studies as they have complicated phenomenology, which gives rise to significant modeling difficulties. Machine learning techniques, which are capable of overcoming many of these disadvantages, provide satisfactory results.",

Cyber security network attack issues and possible machine learning solutions are also elaborated. The basic network communication component and working principle are also addressed. Cyber security and data analytics are two major pillars in modern technology. Data attackers try to attack network data in the name of man-in-the-middle attack. Machine learning algorithm is providing numerous solutions for this cyber-attack. Application of machine learning algorithm is also discussed in this chapter. The proposed method is to solve man-in-the-middle attack problem by using reinforcement machine learning algorithm. The reinforcement learning is to create virtual agent that should predict cyber-attack based on previous history. This proposed solution is to avoid future cyber middle man attack in network transmission. ",

        "abstract": "After parliament failed to approve his revised version of the ‘Withdrawal Agreement’, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a snap general election in October 2019 to capitalise on his growing support to ‘Get Brexit Done’. Johnson’s belief was that he had enough support countrywide to gain a majority to push his Brexit mandate through parliament based on a parliamentary seat majority strategy. The increased availability of large-scale Twitter data provides rich information for the study of constituency dynamics. In Twitter, the location of tweets can be identified by the GPS and the location field. This provides a mechanism for location-based sentiment analysis which is the use of natural language processing or machine learning algorithms to extract, identify, or distinguish the sentiment content of a tweet (in our case), according to the location of origin of said tweet. This paper examines location-based Twitter sentiment for UK constituencies per country and aims to understand if location-based Twitter sentiment majorities per UK constituencies could determine the outcome of the UK Brexit election. Tweets are gathered from the whisperings of the UK Brexit election on September 4th 2019 until polling day, 12th December 2019. A Naive Bayes classification algorithm is applied to assess political public Twitter sentiment. We identify the sentiment of Twitter users per constituency per country towards the political parties’ mandate on Brexit and plot our findings for visualisation. We compare the grouping of location-based sentiment per constituency for each of the four UK countries to the final Brexit election first party results per constituency to determine the accuracy of location-based sentiment in determining the Brexit election result. Our results indicate that location-based sentiment had the single biggest effect on constituency result predictions in Northern Ireland and Scotland and a marginal effect on Wales base constituencies whilst there was no significant prediction accuracy to England’s constituencies. Decision tree, neural network, and Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms are then created to forecast the election results per constituency using location-based sentiment and constituency-based data from the UK electorate at national level. The predictive accuracy of the machine learning models was compared comprehensively to a computed-baseline model. The comparison results show that the machine learning models outperformed the baseline model predicting Brexit Election constituency results at national level showing an accuracy rate of 97.87%, 95.74 and 93.62% respectively. The results indicate that location-based sentiment is a useful variable in predicting elections.",

        "abstract": "Understanding and modelling technical and biological processes is one of the basic prerequisites for the management and control of such processes. With the help of identification, the interdependencies of such processes can be deciphered and thus a model can be achieved. The verification of the models enables the quality of the models to be assessed. This article focuses on the identification and verification of motion and sensory feedback-based action potentials in peripheral nerves. Based on the acquisition of action potentials, the identification process correlates physiological and motion-based parameters to match movement trajectories and the corresponding action potentials. After a brief description of a prototype of a biosignal acquisition and identification system, this article introduces a new identification method, the symbiotic cycle, based on the well-known term symbiotic simulation. As an example, this article presents a data-driven method to create a human readable model without using presampled data. The closed-loop identification method is integrated into this symbiotic cycle. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractFatal accidents are a major issue hindering the wide acceptance of safety-critical systems that employ machine learning and deep learning models, such as automated driving vehicles. In order to use machine learning in a safety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security of the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely accepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these systems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered system is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into requirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models used in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant technical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to select a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and explore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning systems—that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of machine learning models and systems—as well as discuss related works and research directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our results show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of requirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of interpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a conventional system quality standard SQuaRE with the characteristics of machine learning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find that a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the greatest impact on conventional quality models.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to evaluate the learning-teaching process using machine learning techniques and the conclusions drawn in an experience on eight courses of very diverse fields. The method is based on data visualization supported by multidimensional scaling. Students’ learning behavior can be visually interpreted from the graphical results obtained with this methodology. This proposal allows to identify learning patterns that might either confirm previous assumptions or expose unknown and unexpected knowledge. Instructors who aim at identifying those factors with larger impact on the learning-teaching impact might be potential users of this approach. The results obtained on 426 students prove the usefulness of these techniques as appealing feedback in order to re-adjust the learning-teaching process in consonance with the actual performance of the students. Specifically, a case study about changing the teaching methodology to Blend-Learning by using a content management system through Moodle is presented.",

Jobseekers and employers want to have accurate information and prediction results in order to have suitable job proposals for themselves and candidates. This research is conducted based on using Machine Learning to meet the requirements of jobseekers and employers in the recruitment evaluation process. We propose to use 4 machine learning methods – Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict job applications. The data set is collected from the Job Center of Binh Duong province. On the basis of the best results method, we build a job application review and visualize the results.",

        "abstract": "After parliament failed to approve his revised version of the ‘Withdrawal Agreement’, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a snap general election in October 2019 to capitalise on his growing support to ‘Get Brexit Done’. Johnson’s belief was that he had enough support countrywide to gain a majority to push his Brexit mandate through parliament based on a parliamentary seat majority strategy. The increased availability of large-scale Twitter data provides rich information for the study of constituency dynamics. In Twitter, the location of tweets can be identified by the GPS and the location field. This provides a mechanism for location-based sentiment analysis which is the use of natural language processing or machine learning algorithms to extract, identify, or distinguish the sentiment content of a tweet (in our case), according to the location of origin of said tweet. This paper examines location-based Twitter sentiment for UK constituencies per country and aims to understand if location-based Twitter sentiment majorities per UK constituencies could determine the outcome of the UK Brexit election. Tweets are gathered from the whisperings of the UK Brexit election on September 4th 2019 until polling day, 12th December 2019. A Naive Bayes classification algorithm is applied to assess political public Twitter sentiment. We identify the sentiment of Twitter users per constituency per country towards the political parties’ mandate on Brexit and plot our findings for visualisation. We compare the grouping of location-based sentiment per constituency for each of the four UK countries to the final Brexit election first party results per constituency to determine the accuracy of location-based sentiment in determining the Brexit election result. Our results indicate that location-based sentiment had the single biggest effect on constituency result predictions in Northern Ireland and Scotland and a marginal effect on Wales base constituencies whilst there was no significant prediction accuracy to England’s constituencies. Decision tree, neural network, and Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms are then created to forecast the election results per constituency using location-based sentiment and constituency-based data from the UK electorate at national level. The predictive accuracy of the machine learning models was compared comprehensively to a computed-baseline model. The comparison results show that the machine learning models outperformed the baseline model predicting Brexit Election constituency results at national level showing an accuracy rate of 97.87%, 95.74 and 93.62% respectively. The results indicate that location-based sentiment is a useful variable in predicting elections.",

        "abstract": "Understanding and modelling technical and biological processes is one of the basic prerequisites for the management and control of such processes. With the help of identification, the interdependencies of such processes can be deciphered and thus a model can be achieved. The verification of the models enables the quality of the models to be assessed. This article focuses on the identification and verification of motion and sensory feedback-based action potentials in peripheral nerves. Based on the acquisition of action potentials, the identification process correlates physiological and motion-based parameters to match movement trajectories and the corresponding action potentials. After a brief description of a prototype of a biosignal acquisition and identification system, this article introduces a new identification method, the symbiotic cycle, based on the well-known term symbiotic simulation. As an example, this article presents a data-driven method to create a human readable model without using presampled data. The closed-loop identification method is integrated into this symbiotic cycle. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractFatal accidents are a major issue hindering the wide acceptance of safety-critical systems that employ machine learning and deep learning models, such as automated driving vehicles. In order to use machine learning in a safety-critical system, it is necessary to demonstrate the safety and security of the system through engineering processes. However, thus far, no such widely accepted engineering concepts or frameworks have been established for these systems. The key to using a machine learning model in a deductively engineered system is decomposing the data-driven training of machine learning models into requirement, design, and verification, particularly for machine learning models used in safety-critical systems. Simultaneously, open problems and relevant technical fields are not organized in a manner that enables researchers to select a theme and work on it. In this study, we identify, classify, and explore the open problems in engineering (safety-critical) machine learning systems—that is, in terms of requirement, design, and verification of machine learning models and systems—as well as discuss related works and research directions, using automated driving vehicles as an example. Our results show that machine learning models are characterized by a lack of requirements specification, lack of design specification, lack of interpretability, and lack of robustness. We also perform a gap analysis on a conventional system quality standard SQuaRE with the characteristics of machine learning models to study quality models for machine learning systems. We find that a lack of requirements specification and lack of robustness have the greatest impact on conventional quality models.",

        "abstract": "The brain is one of the most sensitive parts of the human body which\ntransmits millions of signals every moment. Dementia is the most emerging brain\nhealth issue which involves memory loss, difficulty in problem-solving, handling\ncomplex tasks, etc. Dementia is a syndrome that causes a loss of mental ability. It\naffects memory, thinking, shape, comprehension, counting, reading ability, language,\nand judgment. Dementia affects millions of people and can be the leading cause of\ndeath. It is now the seventh leading cause of death worldwide, as well as one of the\nmajor causes of impairment and reliance on elderly people. There is no treatment for\ndementia at present. The importance of early detection and diagnosis in improving\nearly and effective management is crucial. Predicting dementia in advance can lead us\nto a better life. To predict dementia, various Machine Learning models have been used.\nIn this paper, Dementia is predicted on the basis of MRI Images, for this, three\ndifferent datasets of MRI Images have been collected. Furthermore, for better\nprediction, various Machine learning models are used to predict dementia and validate\nthe performance with statistical analysis like K-Nearest Neighbours, XG Boost,\nSupport Vector Machine, Random Forest Algorithm (RFA), and Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN). Out of all algorithms, Random Forest Algorithm and Convolutional\nNeural Network gave the best result with the accuracy of 93.2 and 99.9 respectively.",

It is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide, imposing a significant socioeconomic burden to society. Research on cerebrovascular diseases has been rapidly progressing leading to improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients nowadays. Machine learning holds many promises for further improving clinical care of these disorders. In this chapter, we will briefly introduce general information regarding cerebrovascular disorders and summarize some of the most promising fields in which machine learning shall be valuable to improve research and patient care. More specifically, we will cover the following cerebrovascular disorders: stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), cerebral microbleeds, cerebral vascular malformations, intracranial aneurysms, and cerebral small vessel disease (white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, perivascular spaces).",

        "abstract": "We propose an efficient machine learning algorithm for two-stage stochastic programs. This machine learning algorithm is termed as projected stochastic hybrid learning algorithm, and consists of stochastic sub-gradient and piecewise linear approximation methods. We use the stochastic sub-gradient and sample information to update the piecewise linear approximation on the objective function. Then we introduce a projection step, which implemented the sub-gradient methods, to jump out from a local optimum, so that we can achieve a global optimum. By the innovative projection step, we show the convergent property of the algorithm for general two-stage stochastic programs. Furthermore, for the network recourse problem, our algorithm can drop the projection steps, but still maintains the convergence property. Thus, if we properly construct the initial piecewise linear functions, the pure piecewise linear approximation method is convergent for general two-stage stochastic programs. The proposed approximate dynamic programming algorithm overcomes the high dimensional state variables using methods from machine learning, and its logic capture the critical ability of the network structure to anticipate the impact of decisions now on the future. The optimization framework, which is carefully calibrated against historical performance, make it possible to introduce changes in the decisions and capture the collective intelligence of the experienced decisions. Computational results indicate that the algorithm exhibits rapid convergence.",

        "abstract": "In today's highly competitive global market, defects in manufacturing cause additional costs and these costs decrease the profit margin. So, defect-free products are crucial for firms. There are various studies conducted with different methodologies in different fields related to defect detection in the literature. Although one of these methodologies is machine learning (ML) algorithms, the literature review shows very few studies using these algorithms to detect physical product defects. This study aims to utilize machine learning algorithms for predicting defects in the manufacturing. Different ML algorithms are used to predict defected products. Then the performances of the algorithms are compared to find the most appropriate algorithm. The study is conducted on one of the leading manufacturing companies in Turkey, and the data is provided from the real-life problem of the company. With the proposed algorithm, it is desirable to predict defected products that may occur during the powder coating phase.",

The first principle architecture of cyclic graphs comprises directed graphs similar to the Bayesian networks except that they include loops. Formally, such networks represent dynamical systems in the wider context and therefore represent some form of temporal modeling. The second type of models have connections between neurons that are bi-directional. These types of networks will be discussed in the context of stochastic units in the second half of this chapter.",

        "abstract": "<p>Name of a person reflects a lot about his origin, gender and more. Naming is a fragment of language and can be an identifier as it contains patterns that could be learned in order to classify individual’s gender based on their names (first name and middle name). In this paper a multi-national, multi-ethnicity and multi-language names (first name) based classification or guessing of gender is per-formed by popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Recent advancements of various Artificial Intelligence inspired algorithms offer various options for text classification. This paper investigates first name based gender identification on a dataset of 84,899 first names and middle name initials with gender labels. The algorithms tested on this task are Support Vector Classifications (linear and non-linear), Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and a simple embedding based deep learning model (SimpleText). Among the models the significant results out of this study is that linear model (94.62%) performs equivalent with the complex machine learning models and the simple embedding based deep learning network SimpleText outperforms (94.67%) all the models, even the other Recurrent and Convolutional networks </p>",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is becoming more and more important for mechatronic systems and will become an ordinary part of today's student life. Thus, it is obvious that machine learning should be part of today's student's curriculum. Unfortunately, machine learning seldomly is implemented into the curriculum in a substantial or linking manner, but rather offered as an elective course. This chapter provides an analysis of how machine learning can be integrated as a mandatory part of the curriculum of mechatronic degree courses. It is considered what the required minimal changes in fundamental courses should be and how traditional subjects like robotics, automation, and automotive engineering can profit most of this approach. As a case study, this chapter utilizes an existing German mechatronic degree course specialized on information technology, which covers most of the discussed aspects. ",

        "abstract": "Video streaming services top the internet traffic surging forward a competitive environment to impart best quality of experience (QoE) to the users. The standard codecs utilized in video transmission systems eliminate the spatiotemporal redundancies in order to decrease the bandwidth requirement. This may adversely affect the perceptual quality of videos. To rate a video quality both subjective and objective parameters can be used. So, it is essential to construct frameworks which will measure integrity of video just like humans. This chapter focuses on application of machine learning to evaluate the QoE without requiring human efforts with higher accuracy of 86% and 91% employing the linear and support vector regression respectively. Machine learning model is developed to forecast the subjective quality of H.264 videos obtained after streaming through wireless networks from the subjective scores. ",

        "abstract": "The faults in transmission lines should be identified for attaining high quality energy in electrical power systems. Savings can be made in both time and energy if the transmission line faults are classified accurately. The present study examined phase-ground, phase-phase-ground, phase-phase, phase-phase-phase and no fault cases. Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Ensemble, Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers were used for classifying the transmission line faults. These algorithms were compared with regard to parameters such as accuracy, error rate, prediction speed and training time. The accuracy and minimum error of SVM and KNN classifiers were 99.7 % and 0.0011 respectively. DT classifier is faster than the other classifiers with a predicted  speed of 29000 obs/sec. Whereas LDA had the shortest training time of 0.76992 sec. The results have indicated that SVM, KNN classifiers have similar performances. In addition, the classifiers SVM, KNN acquired minimum error with the highest accuracy compared with the other classifiers. While DT has the highest estimation speed, LDA has the shortest training time.",

Although both are hot research topics, so far, little attention has been paid to how these two technologies converge with each other. This relation is not obvious as while it is feasible to enhance gamification with machine learning, it is also feasible to support machine learning with gamification; moreover, there are applications in which machine learning and gamification are combined yet not directly connected. In this study, we aim to shed light on the use of both machine learning in gamification and gamification in machine learning, as well as the related topics of using gamification in machine learning education and machine learning in gamification research. By performing a systematic literature mapping, we not only identify prior works addressing these respective themes, but also analyze how their popularity evolved in time, investigate the areas of application reported by prior works, used machine learning techniques and software tools, as well as the character of research contribution and the character of evaluation results for works that presented them.",

        "abstract": "The demands for machine learning and knowledge extraction methods have been booming due to the unprecedented surge in data volume and data quality. Nevertheless, challenges arise amid the emerging data complexity as significant chunks of information and knowledge lie within the non-ordinal realm of data. To address the challenges, researchers developed considerable machine learning and knowledge extraction methods regarding various domain-specific challenges. To characterize and extract information from non-ordinal data, all the developed methods pointed to the subject of Information Theory, established following Shannon’s landmark paper in 1948. This article reviews recent developments in entropic statistics, including estimation of Shannon’s entropy and its functionals (such as mutual information and Kullback–Leibler divergence), concepts of entropic basis, generalized Shannon’s entropy (and its functionals), and their estimations and potential applications in machine learning and knowledge extraction. With the knowledge of recent development in entropic statistics, researchers can customize existing machine learning and knowledge extraction methods for better performance or develop new approaches to address emerging domain-specific challenges.",

        "abstract": "The harmful impacts of excessive stress on people’s health have been widely acknowledged, necessitating effective methods for its identification. Recognizing the importance of early stress detection and intervention, this research aims to contribute to the field of healthcare. To achieve this objective, this study classifies electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by assessing physio-psychological states, specifically stress and examines the role of music therapy in alleviating stress. ECG signals, recorded both before and after a music therapy session, were collected. Using signal processing techniques, essential features were extracted from these ECG signals, resulting in a more accurate identification of stress. Additionally, through experimentation and model evaluation, k-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were determined to be the most effective models for this classification. Both models consistently yielded 90% accuracy.

        "abstract": "An Organic chemical called Dopamine belongs to catecholamine and phenethylamine chemical families. A neurotransmitter chemical released by neurons and is one of prime function of Dopamine in the brain. They are essential in communicating messages for all parts of the brain and between the brain and body organs. Body movement is controlled by dopamine. A lack of or an insufficient dopamine generation in part of the brain can lead to Parkinson ’s Disease (PD). It is a one of neurological disorder that affects body movement. It may cause stiffness, trembling in body parts. Detection of low level dopamine is challenging and complex as the low level of dopamine is related to Parkinson’s disease. In this chapter we present an approach towards early detection of this neurological disorder PD by employing CMOS readout circuit which measures and amplifies low level dopamine in the form of electrical signal from brain with help of electrodes.ADC is used to convert amplified analog signal to digital information. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict the disease based on the data received from the readout circuit. Dopamine level is measured in current which ranges from pA to nA. CMOS Amplifiers are used to strengthen the acquired signal in the range of millivolts (mV) with the help of bio amplifiers. For conversion of acquired current in the range of pA to voltage with amplitude of micro voltage (µV) CMOS front called Transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is employed. This chapter provides complete design and analysis of low noise, low power CMOS machine learning based readout circuit for detection and prediction of Parkinson’s disease.",

We start by detailing the main performance metrics for different tasks (classification, regression), and how they may be interpreted, including in the face of class imbalance, varying prevalence, or asymmetric cost–benefit trade-offs. We then explain how to estimate these metrics in an unbiased manner using training, validation, and test sets. We describe cross-validation procedures—to use a larger part of the data for both training and testing—and the dangers of data leakage—optimism bias due to training data contaminating the test set. Finally, we discuss how to obtain confidence intervals of performance metrics, distinguishing two situations: internal validation or evaluation of learning algorithms and external validation or evaluation of resulting prediction models.",

In addition to obtaining more observations, we can also look for additional features of interest that we do not currently have, at which point it will invariably be necessary to integrate data from different sources. This section introduces this process of data integration, starting with an introduction of two methods: “joins” (to access more features) and “unions” (to access more observations) and continues on to cover regular expressions, data summarization, crosstabs, data reduction and splitting, and data wrangling in all its flavors.",

        "abstract": "Today's corporate world focuses not only on the set of skills of the potential employees, but also on their respective personality. Personality helps you succeed in both your professional and personal life. Therefore, recruiters need to be aware of an individual's personality trait. While the number of job seekers is increasing exponentially, the number of positions is declining, making it difficult to manually add the best candidate for the right position to the candidate list by looking at your resume. This article explores a variety of machine learning approaches to efficiently predict the personality by the usage of Natural language processing (NLP) technology. The results showcase that Random-forest achieves higher accuracy than several other algorithms i.e. KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes. This system can be used in many business areas / areas that may require professional candidates. This system reduces the workload of the department (general workers, employment, and training and dismissal department).",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries,\n(b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous),\nand (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships.\nFrom these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.\n                    ",

        "abstract": "Optimal student performance is integral for successful higher education institutions. The consensus is that big data analytics can be used to identify ways for achieving better student academic performance. This article used support vector machines to predict future student performance in computing and mathematics disciplines based on past scores in computing, mathematics and statistics subjects. Past subjects passed by students were ranked with state of art feature selection techniques in an attempt to identify any connection between good performance in a particular discipline and past subject knowledge. Up to 80% classification accuracy was achieved with support vector machines, demonstrating that this method can be developed to produce recommender or guidance systems for students, however the classification model will still benefit from more training examples. The results from this research reemphasizes the possibility and benefits of using machine learning techniques to improve teaching and learning in higher education institutions. ",

        "abstract": "The Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) is predominately used by the electric utility industry and, consequently, in smart grids. The Peekaboo attack was created to compromise DNP3 traffic, in which a man-in-the-middle on a communication link can capture and drop selected encrypted DNP3 messages by using support vector machine learning algorithms. The communication networks of smart grids are a important part of their infrastructure, so it is of critical importance to keep this communication secure and reliable. The main contribution of this paper is to compare the use of machine learning techniques to classify messages of the same protocol exchanged in encrypted tunnels. The study considers four simulated cases of encrypted DNP3 traffic scenarios and four different supervised machine learning algorithms: Decision tree, nearest-neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. The results obtained show that it is possible to extend a Peekaboo attack over multiple substations, using a decision tree learning algorithm, and to gather significant information from a system that communicates using encrypted DNP3 traffic.",

        "abstract": "<div>Humans, as the most powerful learners on the planet, have accumulated a lot of learning skills, such as learning through tests, interleaving learning,  self-explanation, active recalling, to name a few. These learning skills and methodologies enable humans to learn new topics more effectively and efficiently. We are interested in investigating whether humans' learning skills can be borrowed to help machines to learn better. Specifically, we aim to formalize these skills and leverage them to train better machine learning (ML) models. To achieve this goal, we develop a general framework -- Skillearn, which provides a principled way to represent humans' learning skills mathematically and use the formally-represented skills to improve the training of ML models. In two case studies, we apply Skillearn to formalize two learning skills of humans: learning by passing tests and interleaving learning, and use the formalized skills to improve neural architecture search. Experiments on various datasets show that trained using the skills formalized by Skillearn, ML models achieve significantly better performance.</div>",

        "abstract": "An Organic chemical called Dopamine belongs to catecholamine and phenethylamine chemical families. A neurotransmitter chemical released by neurons and is one of prime function of Dopamine in the brain. They are essential in communicating messages for all parts of the brain and between the brain and body organs. Body movement is controlled by dopamine. A lack of or an insufficient dopamine generation in part of the brain can lead to Parkinson ’s Disease (PD). It is a one of neurological disorder that affects body movement. It may cause stiffness, trembling in body parts. Detection of low level dopamine is challenging and complex as the low level of dopamine is related to Parkinson’s disease. In this chapter we present an approach towards early detection of this neurological disorder PD by employing CMOS readout circuit which measures and amplifies low level dopamine in the form of electrical signal from brain with help of electrodes.ADC is used to convert amplified analog signal to digital information. Machine learning algorithms are used to predict the disease based on the data received from the readout circuit. Dopamine level is measured in current which ranges from pA to nA. CMOS Amplifiers are used to strengthen the acquired signal in the range of millivolts (mV) with the help of bio amplifiers. For conversion of acquired current in the range of pA to voltage with amplitude of micro voltage (µV) CMOS front called Transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is employed. This chapter provides complete design and analysis of low noise, low power CMOS machine learning based readout circuit for detection and prediction of Parkinson’s disease.",

        "abstract": "Access to additional and relevant data will lead to better predictions from algorithms until we reach the point where more observations (cases) are no longer helpful to detect the signal, the feature(s), or conditions that inform the target. In addition to obtaining more observations, we can also look for additional features of interest that we do not currently have, at which point it will invariably be necessary to integrate data from different sources. This section introduces this process of data integration, starting with an introduction of two methods: “joins” (to access more features) and “unions” (to access more observations) and continues on to cover regular expressions, data summarization, crosstabs, data reduction and splitting, and data wrangling in all its flavors.",

        "abstract": "Today's corporate world focuses not only on the set of skills of the potential employees, but also on their respective personality. Personality helps you succeed in both your professional and personal life. Therefore, recruiters need to be aware of an individual's personality trait. While the number of job seekers is increasing exponentially, the number of positions is declining, making it difficult to manually add the best candidate for the right position to the candidate list by looking at your resume. This article explores a variety of machine learning approaches to efficiently predict the personality by the usage of Natural language processing (NLP) technology. The results showcase that Random-forest achieves higher accuracy than several other algorithms i.e. KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes. This system can be used in many business areas / areas that may require professional candidates. This system reduces the workload of the department (general workers, employment, and training and dismissal department).",

We start by detailing the main performance metrics for different tasks (classification, regression), and how they may be interpreted, including in the face of class imbalance, varying prevalence, or asymmetric cost–benefit trade-offs. We then explain how to estimate these metrics in an unbiased manner using training, validation, and test sets. We describe cross-validation procedures—to use a larger part of the data for both training and testing—and the dangers of data leakage—optimism bias due to training data contaminating the test set. Finally, we discuss how to obtain confidence intervals of performance metrics, distinguishing two situations: internal validation or evaluation of learning algorithms and external validation or evaluation of resulting prediction models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in various fields of science has increased rapidly, especially in the last 10 years. The increasing availability of soil data that can be efficiently acquired remotely and proximally, and freely available open-source algorithms, have led to an accelerated adoption of ML techniques to analyse soil data. Given the large number of publications, it is an impossible task to manually review all papers on the application of ML in soil science without narrowing down a narrative of ML application in a specific research question. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of ML techniques in soil science aided by a ML algorithm (latent Dirichlet allocation) to find patterns in a large collection of text corpora. The objective is to gain insight into publications of ML applications in soil science and to discuss the research gaps in this topic. We found that (a) there is an increasing usage of ML methods in soil sciences, mostly concentrated in developed countries,\n(b) the reviewed publications can be grouped into 12 topics, namely remote sensing, soil organic carbon, water, contamination, methods (ensembles), erosion and parent material, methods (NN, neural networks, SVM, support vector machines), spectroscopy, modelling (classes), crops, physical, and modelling (continuous),\nand (c) advanced ML methods usually perform better than simpler approaches thanks to their capability to capture non-linear relationships.\nFrom these findings, we found research gaps, in particular, about the precautions that should be taken (parsimony) to avoid overfitting, and that the interpretability of the ML models is an important aspect to consider when applying advanced ML methods in order to improve our knowledge and understanding of soil. We foresee that a large number of studies will focus on the latter topic.\n                    ",

        "abstract": "The harmful impacts of excessive stress on people’s health have been widely acknowledged, necessitating effective methods for its identification. Recognizing the importance of early stress detection and intervention, this research aims to contribute to the field of healthcare. To achieve this objective, this study classifies electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by assessing physio-psychological states, specifically stress and examines the role of music therapy in alleviating stress. ECG signals, recorded both before and after a music therapy session, were collected. Using signal processing techniques, essential features were extracted from these ECG signals, resulting in a more accurate identification of stress. Additionally, through experimentation and model evaluation, k-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were determined to be the most effective models for this classification. Both models consistently yielded 90% accuracy. These identified extracted features and models are vital to effectively recognizing stress in ECG signals, offering valuable insights for future studies and clinical applications. This research contributes not only to the development of tools for stress detection but also to the understanding of the therapeutic impact of music.",

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a self-defense tool for preventing several types of cyberattacks. Latest machine learning (ML) methods are becoming the backbone for constructing intelligent IDS that are highly data driven. This chapter proposes decision tree based IDS for the dataset NSL-KDD. A novel approach has been developed for the ranking of security features. The proposed system has been validated against performance evaluation metrics consisting of recall, precision, accuracy, and F score. The results produced by the proposed system are compared with well-known ML methods including logistic regression, support vector machines and K-nearest neighbor in order to analyse the efficiency.",

A vast amount of time is invested in electronic mail for communication in the information technology field, due to which electronic mail management has become a prominent feature among the mailing applications. Electronic mail classification comes under this type of management which helps the expert to eliminate the time invested during un-necessary mail reading. Also, the content of electronic mail is further used in the analysis for future prediction and reading behaviors in which a good mail classification system would reduce a lot of time and resources. Conventionally many other systems or methods are present and widely popular in the market but there is no such system that achieves high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel electronic mail classification system that is based ensemble technique which combines the result of many classifiers to achieve good accuracy.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate wildfire risk estimation is an essential yet challenging task. As the frequency of extreme fire weather and wildfires is on the rise, forest managers and firefighters require accurate wildfire risk estimations to successfully implement forest management and firefighting strategies. Wildfire risk depends on non-linear interactions between multiple factors; therefore, the performance of linear models in its estimation is limited. To date, several traditional fire weather indices (FWIs) have been commonly used by weather services, such as the Canadian FWI.@Traditional FWIs are primarily based on empirical and statistical analyses. In this paper, we propose a novel FWI that was developed using machine learning—the machine learning based fire weather index (MLFWI). We present the performance of the MLFWI and compare it with various traditional FWIs. We find that the MLFWI significantly outperforms traditional indices in predicting wildfire occurrence, achieving an area under the curve score of 0.99 compared to 0.62–0.80. We recommend applying the MLFWI in wildfire warning systems.",

Some of these files can be easily categorized to relevant files. However, there are always some files left unorganized due to their difficulty in categorization [1]. Such files pile up in the download folder as time passes, making the folder extremely messy. Many people do not have the motive to clean up the folder as it requires a lot of energy and time. Based on this common problem, my group developed an app that can clean the messy folder up. After applying our program which is based on machine learning, the files will firstly be divided into five general parts – document, video, music, photos and package. Then the files will be further categorized based on the contents they present. For example, photos are divided into animals, families and so on. In order to achieve the content-categorizing function, several powerful apis were introduced in our program, and they helped us to achieve the optimal results.",

        "abstract": "The employment of machine learning algorithms in disease classification has evolved as a precision medicine for scientific innovation. The geometric growth in various machine learning systems has paved the way for more research in the medical imaging process. This research aims to promote the development of machine learning algorithms for the classification of medical images. Automated classification of medical images is a fascinating application of machine learning and they have the possibility of higher predictability and accuracy. The technological advancement in the processing of medical imaging will help to reduce the complexities of diseases and some existing constraints will be greatly minimized. This research exposes the main ensemble learning techniques as it covers the theoretical background of machine learning, applications, comparison of machine learning and deep learning, ensemble learning with reviews of state-of the art literature, framework, and analysis. The work extends to medical image types, applications, benefits, and operations. We proposed the application of the ensemble machine learning approach in the classification of medical images for better performance and accuracy. The integration of advanced technology in clinical imaging will help in the prompt classification, prediction, early detection, and a better interpretation of medical images, this will, in turn, improves the quality of life and expands the clinical bearing for machine learning applications.",

        "abstract": "The development of machine learning algorithms together with the availability of computational tools nowadays have given an increase in the application of artificial intelligence methodologies in different fields. However, the use of these machine learning approaches in nanomedicine remains still underexplored in certain areas, despite the development in hardware and software tools. In this review, the recent advances in the conjunction of machine learning with nanomedicine are shown. Examples dealing with biomedical properties of nanoparticles, characterization of nanomaterials, text mining, and image analysis are also presented. Finally, some future perspectives in the integration of nanomedicine with cloud computing, deep learning and other techniques are discussed. ",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly applied for the control of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in application areas that cannot easily be mastered with traditional control approaches, such as autonomous driving. As a consequence, the safety of machine learning became a focus area for research in recent years. Despite very considerable advances in selected areas related to machine learning safety, shortcomings were identified on holistic approaches that take an end-to-end view on the risks associated to the engineering of ML-based control systems and their certification. Applying a classic technique of safety engineering, our paper provides a comprehensive and methodological analysis of the safety hazards that could be introduced along the ML lifecycle, and could compromise the safe operation of ML-based CPS. Identified hazards are illustrated and explained using a real-world application scenario—an autonomous shop-floor transportation vehicle. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is intended as a basis for future holistic approaches for safety engineering of ML-based CPS in safety-critical applications, and aims to support the focus on research onto safety hazards that are not yet adequately addressed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPhotoelastic techniques have a long tradition in both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the stresses in granular materials. Over the last two decades, computational methods for reconstructing forces between particles from their photoelastic response have been developed by many different experimental teams. Unfortunately, all of these methods are computationally expensive. This limits their use for processing extensive data sets that capture the time evolution of granular ensembles consisting of a large number of particles. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this problem that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks to recognize complex spatial patterns. The main drawback of using neural networks is that training them usually requires a large labeled data set which is hard to obtain experimentally. We show that this problem can be successfully circumvented by pretraining the networks on a large synthetic data set and then fine-tuning them on much smaller experimental data sets. Due to our current lack of experimental data, we demonstrate the potential of our method by changing the size of the considered particles which alters the exhibited photoelastic patterns more than typical experimental errors.",

Be that as it may, aside from a couple of simple errands, for example, finding the briefest way between two points, it isn't to program more mind boggling and continually developing difficulties. There was an acknowledgment that the best way to have the capacity to accomplish this undertaking was to give machines a chance to gain from itself. This sounds like a youngster learning from itself. So, machine learning was produced as another capacity for computers. Also, machine learning is available in such huge numbers of sections of technology that we don't understand it while utilizing it. This chapter explores advanced-level security in network and real-time applications using machine learning. ",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development of information technology, machine learning and data mining have gradually found widespread applications across various industries. These technologies delve deeper into uncovering intrinsic patterns through the application of computer science. This trend is especially evident in today’s era of advanced artificial intelligence, which marks the anticipated third industrial revolution. By harnessing cutting-edge techniques such as multimodal large-scale models, artificial intelligence is profoundly impacting traditional scientific research methods. The use of machine learning and data mining techniques in medical research has a long-standing history. In addition to traditional methods such as logistic regression, decision trees, and Bayesian analysis, newer technologies such as neural networks, random forests, support vector machines, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost have gradually gained widespread adoption. Each of these techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, requiring careful selection based on the specific research objectives in clinical practice. Today, with the emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT 3.5, machine learning and data mining are gaining new meanings and application prospects. ChatGPT offers benefits such as optimized code algorithms and ease of use, saving time and enhancing efficiency for medical researchers. It is worth promoting the use of ChatGPT in clinical research.",

        "abstract": "The planning of safe trajectories in critical traffic scenarios using model-based algorithms is a very computationally intensive task. Recently proposed algorithms, namely Hybrid Augmented CL-RRT, Hybrid Augmented CL-RRT+ and GATE-ARRT+, reduce the computation time for safe trajectory planning drastically using a combination of a deep learning algorithm 3D-ConvNet with a vehicle dynamic model. An efficient embedded implementation of these algorithms is required as the vehicle on-board micro-controller resources are limited. This work proposes methodologies for replacing the computationally intensive modules of these trajectory planning algorithms using different efficient machine learning and analytical methods. The required computational resources are measured by downloading and running the algorithms on various hardware platforms. The results show significant reduction in computational resources and the potential of proposed algorithms to run in real time. Also, alternative architectures for 3D-ConvNet are presented for further reduction of required computational resources.",

In biomedical applications, enormous amounts of medical data are produced and collected to predict disease type and stage of the disease. Detection and prediction of diseases, such as diabetes, lung cancer, brain cancer, heart disease, and liver diseases, requires huge tests and that increases the size of patient medical data. Robust prediction of a patient's disease from the huge data set is an important agenda in in this chapter. The challenge of applying a machine learning method is to select the best algorithm within the disease prediction framework. This chapter opts for robust machine learning algorithms for various diseases by using case studies. This usually analyzes each dimension of disease, independently checking the identified value between the limits to monitor the condition of the disease. ",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly applied for the control of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in application areas that cannot easily be mastered with traditional control approaches, such as autonomous driving. As a consequence, the safety of machine learning became a focus area for research in recent years. Despite very considerable advances in selected areas related to machine learning safety, shortcomings were identified on holistic approaches that take an end-to-end view on the risks associated to the engineering of ML-based control systems and their certification. Applying a classic technique of safety engineering, our paper provides a comprehensive and methodological analysis of the safety hazards that could be introduced along the ML lifecycle, and could compromise the safe operation of ML-based CPS. Identified hazards are illustrated and explained using a real-world application scenario—an autonomous shop-floor transportation vehicle. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper is intended as a basis for future holistic approaches for safety engineering of ML-based CPS in safety-critical applications, and aims to support the focus on research onto safety hazards that are not yet adequately addressed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPhotoelastic techniques have a long tradition in both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the stresses in granular materials. Over the last two decades, computational methods for reconstructing forces between particles from their photoelastic response have been developed by many different experimental teams. Unfortunately, all of these methods are computationally expensive. This limits their use for processing extensive data sets that capture the time evolution of granular ensembles consisting of a large number of particles. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this problem that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks to recognize complex spatial patterns. The main drawback of using neural networks is that training them usually requires a large labeled data set which is hard to obtain experimentally. We show that this problem can be successfully circumvented by pretraining the networks on a large synthetic data set and then fine-tuning them on much smaller experimental data sets. Due to our current lack of experimental data, we demonstrate the potential of our method by changing the size of the considered particles which alters the exhibited photoelastic patterns more than typical experimental errors.",

So, machine learning was produced as another capacity for computers. Also, machine learning is available in such huge numbers of sections of technology that we don't understand it while utilizing it.

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles are a potential solution to preventing crashes caused by human error. Although road signs are intended to attract drivers' attention and help them operate, drivers can still misinterpret signs, resulting in an accident. An autonomous vehicle system can implement artificial intelligence to detect and recognize known patterns in input graphics to minimize the human aspect of driving. In this study, we present an implementation of the CNN architecture to classify four regulatory instruments (stop, crosswalk, speed limit sign, and traffic light) using the TensorFlow library. We used a training dataset of 877 images of the four distinct classes to optimize the model. The goal of the study was to create a lightweight and accessible image classification model. Experimental results show a 92% model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Evolving technologies involve numerous IoT-enabled smart devices that are connected 24-7 to the internet. Existing surveys propose there are 6 billion devices on the internet and it will increase to 20 billion devices within a few years. Energy conservation, capacity, and computational speed plays an essential part in these smart devices, and they are vulnerable to a wide range of security attack challenges. Major concerns still lurk around the IoT ecosystem due to security threats. Major IoT security concerns are Denial of service(DoS), Sensitive Data Exposure, Unauthorized Device Access, etc. The main motivation of this chapter is to brief all the security issues existing in the internet of things (IoT) along with an analysis of the privacy issues. The chapter mainly focuses on the security loopholes arising from the information exchange technologies used in internet of things and discusses IoT security solutions based on machine learning techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

        "abstract": "Code smell is an inherent property of software that results in design problems which makes the software hard to extend, understand, and maintain. In the literature, several tools are used to detect code smell that are informally defined or subjective in nature due to varying results of the code smell. To resolve this, machine leaning (ML) techniques are proposed and learn to distinguish the characteristics of smelly and non-smelly code elements (classes or methods). However, the dataset constructed by the ML techniques are based on the tools and manually validated code smell samples. In this article, instead of using tools and manual validation, the authors considered detection rules for identifying the smell then applied unsupervised learning for validation to construct two smell datasets. Then, applied classification algorithms are used on the datasets to detect the code smells. The researchers found that all algorithms have achieved high performance in terms of accuracy, F-measure and area under ROC, yet the tree-based classifiers are performing better than other classifiers.

In this article, three sentiment classes such as positive, negative and neutral emotions have been demonstrated by appropriate features from raw unstructured data followed by data preprocessing steps. Applying best in class social analytics methodology to examine the sentiments embedded with purchaser remarks, encourages both producer and individual customers. Machine learning methods such as Naïve Bayes, maximum entropy classification, Deep Neural Networks were used upon the data, extracted from some websites such as Samsung and Apple for sentiment classification. In the online business arena, the application of sentiment classification explores a great opportunity. The subsidy of such an investigation is that associations can apply the proposed social examination framework to exploit the entire social information on the web and therefore improve their proper blueprint promoting strategies corresponding business.

To make the edge and mobile devices smart, fast, and for the better quality of service (QoS), fog computing is an efficient way. Fog computing is providing the way for resource provisioning, service providers, high response time, and the best solution for mobile network traffic. In this chapter, the proposed method is for handling the fog resource management using efficient offloading mechanism. Offloading is done based on machine learning prediction technology and also by using the KNN algorithm to identify the nearest fog nodes to offload. The proposed method minimizes the energy consumption, latency and improves the QoS for edge devices, IoT devices, and mobile devices. ",

        "abstract": "The business world is becoming increasingly saturated in today's competitive environment. There is a great deal of competition in the telecommunications industry, especially due to various vibrant service providers. As a result, they have had difficulty retaining their existing customers. As attracting new customers is much more costly than retaining current ones, now is the time to ensure the telecom industry maintains value by retaining customers over acquiring new ones. Numerous machine learning and data mining methods have been proposed in the literature to predict customer churners using heterogeneous customer records over the past decade. This research gives a brief idea on the Customer Churn problem, and explores how various machine learning techniques can be used to predict customer churn via models such as XGBoost, GradientBoost, AdaBoost, ANN, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and also compare the effectiveness of the models in term of accuracy.

        "abstract": "Prediction of risk during surgical operations is one of the most needed and challenging processes in the healthcare domain. Many researchers use clinical assessment tools to predict perioperative outcomes and postoperative factors in surgical operations. Even though traditional model yields better results, they are not able to achieve promising accuracy due to the enormous growth of data in medical domain. Since the data size grows seamlessly every day, some of the investigators over the past decade use machine learning techniques in their model to predict the risks before and after surgery. Most of the existing systems produced better accuracy by impute missing values in dataset through some common imputation method. However, in order to increase the accuracy level further, two new techniques proposed in this chapter to handle missing values using iterative deepening random forest classifier and identification of surgical risk by using iterative deepening support vector machine. Both of the methods worked well in experimental data set and obtained promising accuracy results. ",

In recent times, machine learning techniques have proven to be very helpful in making better trading decisions. Machine learning algorithms use complex logic to observe and learn the behavior of stocks using historical data which can be used to predict future movements of the stock. Technical indicators such as rolling mean, momentum, and exponential moving average are calculated to convert the data into meaningful information. Furthermore, this information can be used to build machine learning prediction models that learn different patterns in the data and make future predictions for accurate financial forecasting. Additional factors that are being used for stock prediction include social media influences and daily news on trading stocks. Considering these qualitative and quantitative features at the same time result in improved prediction models. ",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in females worldwide. Breast cancer diagnosis and breast cancer prognosis are the two important challenges for the researchers in the medical field and also for the practitioners. If the cells in the breast start to grow without any control, it leads to cancer. Normally, the growth of the lump can be seen using x-ray. The benign and malignant breast lumps are distinguished during breast cancer diagnosis. The prognosis process predicts the period at which the breast cancer is likely to reappear in patients who have had their cancers removed. Data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms are mostly used in the whole process of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. They utilize the large volume of breast cancer data for extracting knowledge. The application of data mining and machine learning methods in biomedical research is presently vital and crucial in efforts to transform intelligently all available data into valuable knowledge. ",

        "abstract": "The well-known puzzle game Tetris, where arrangements of 4 squares (tetrominoes) fall onto the field like meteors, has been found to increase the brain’s efficiency [1]. Many variations came into existence ever since its invention. Sometimes, the leveling can become a double-edged sword, so this game is essentially a Zen mode without a leveling system. This game is built for people who want to play a 3D version of Tetris at a speed they themselves have set. This paper designs a game to exercise spatial visualization. This study uses a Unity/C++-based game [2]. This game will be tested by kids on the autism spectrum, and we will conduct a qualitative evaluation of the approach.  No results have been shown yet, and that is due to the fact that this study is still a work in progress. I am trying to make the game comply with the latest Tetris design guidelines that I can find online (that is, the 2009 guideline).",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is an innovative solution that can autonomously extract patterns and predict trends based on environmental measurements and performance indicators as input to provide self-driven intelligent network systems that can configure and optimize themselves. Under the effects of heterogeneous traffic demand among users and varying channel conditions in WLAN downlink MU-MIMO channels, achieving the maximum system throughput performance is challenging. In addressing these issues, the existing studies have proposed different approaches. However, most of these approaches did not consider a machine-learning based optimization solution. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a machine-learning based adaptive approach that can optimize system frame size that would maximize the system throughput of WLAN in the downlink MUMIMO channel. In this approach, the Access Point (AP) performs the maximum system throughput measurement and collects the “frame size-system throughput patterns” which contains knowledge about the effects of traffic condition, channel condition, and number of stations (STAs). Based on these patterns, our approach uses neural networks to correctly model the system throughput as a function of the system frame size. After training the neural network, we obtain the gradient information to adjust the system frame size. The performance of the proposed ML approach is evaluated over the FIFO aggregation algorithm under the effects of heterogenous traffic patterns for VoIP and Video traffic applications, channel conditions, and number of STAs.",

Governments and the general public have grown more concerned about how air pollution affects human health. Consequently, it is crucial to forecast the air quality with accuracy. In this paper, Machine learning methods SVR and RFR were used to build the hybrid forecast model to predict the concentrations of Air Quality Index in Haryana Cities. The forecast models were built using air pollutants and meteorological parameters from 2019 to 2021 and testing and validation was conducted on the air quality data for the year 2022 of Jind and Panipat city in the State of Haryana. Further, performance of hybrid forecast model was enhanced using scalar technique and performance was evaluated using various coefficient metrics and other parameters. First, the important factors affecting air quality are extracted and irregularities from the dataset are removed. Second, for forecasting AQI various approaches have been used and evaluation is carried out using performance metrics. The experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid model had a better forecast result than the standard Random forest Regression, Support Vector Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.",

Credit card companies usually use their judgment to determine whether a credit card should be issued to the customer satisfying certain criteria. Some machine learning algorithms have also been used to support the decision. The main objective of this paper is to build a deep learning model based on the UCI (University of California, Irvine) data sets, which can support the credit card approval decision. Secondly, the performance of the built model is compared with the other two traditional machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that the overall performance of our deep learning model is slightly better than that of the other two models.",

        "abstract": "Computers, systems, applications, and technology, in general, are becoming\nmore commonly used, advanced, scalable, and thus effective in modern times. Because\nof its widespread use, it undergoes various advancements on a regular basis. A fastpaced\nlife is also associated with modern times. This way of life necessitates that our\nsystems behave similarly. Adaptive Machine Learning (AML) can do things that\nconventional machine learning cannot. It will easily adjust to new information and\ndetermine the significance of that information. Adaptive machine learning uses a\nvariety of data collection, grouping, and analysis methods due to its single-channeled\nstructure. It gathers, analyses, and learns from the information. That is why it is\nadaptive: as long as new data is presented, the system can learn and update. This\nsingle-channeled device acts on any piece of input it receives in order to improve\npotential forecasts and outcomes. Furthermore, since the entire process happens in realtime,\nit can immediately adjust to new actions. High efficiency and impeccably precise\naccuracy are two of AML's main advantages. The system does not become outdated or\nredundant because it is constantly running in real-time. So, incorporating the three core\nconcepts of agility, strength, and efficiency better explains AML.\nAgility helps systems to respond rapidly and without hesitation. The systems achieve\nnew levels of proficiency and accuracy as a result of their power, and they can find new\nways to operate flawlessly at lower costs as a result of their performance. This chapter\ncovers the preparation, regularisation, and structure of deep neural networks such as\nconvolutional and generative adversarial networks. New information in the\nreinforcement learning chapter includes a description of t-SNE, a standard\ndimensionality reduction approach, as well as multilayer perceptrons on auto encoders\nand the word2vec network. As a consequence, these suggestions will assist readers in\napplying what they have learned.\n",

        "abstract": "Squash is a sport where referee decisions are essential to the game. However, these decisions are very subjective in nature. Disputes, both from the players and the audience, regularly occur because the referee made a controversial call. In this study, we propose automating the referee decision process through machine learning. We trained neural networks to predict such decisions using data from 400 referee decisions acquired through extensive video footage reviewing and labeling. Six positional values were extracted, including the attacking player’s position, the retreating player’s position, the ball’s position in the frame, the ball’s projected first bounce, the ball’s projected second bounce, and the attacking player’s racket head position. We calculated nine additional distance values, such as the distance between players and the distance from the attacking player’s racket head to the ball’s path. Models were trained on Wolfram Mathematica and Python using these values. The best Wolfram Mathematica model and the best Python model achieved accuracies of 86% ± 3.03% and 85.2% ± 5.1%, respectively. These accuracies surpass 85%, demonstrating near-human performance. Our model has great potential for improvement as it is currently trained with limited, unbalanced data (400 decisions) and lacks crucial data points such as time and speed. The performance of our model is almost surely going to improve significantly with a larger training dataset. Unlike human referees, machine learning models follow a consistent standard, have unlimited attention spans, and make decisions instantly. If the accuracy is improved in the future, the model can potentially serve as an extra refereeing official for both professional and amateur squash matches. Both the analysis of referee decisions in squash and the proposal to automate the process using machine learning is unique to this study.",

This \nsituation make people must adapt to the new normal, for example: work from \nhome, online communication, keep clean to reduce transmission of COVID-19. \nMoreover, research has found that wearing a mask is one way to reduce the risk \nof viral transmission. It makes many public places have a measure about their \ncustomer must keep a distance between people and wearing the face mask \ncorrectly. But public service providers are not feasible to thoroughly check \nwhether all a customer wear the mask or not. So, in this project, we propose \nface mask detection via webcam cameras using image recognition which is one \nof the high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. This proposed system \nconsists of three methods to detect face mask: 1) Image preprocessing 2) Face \ndetection and crop 3) Classification of face mask. This system can detection a \nface mask, not wearing a face mask and incorrect face mask. This system will \nhelp public service providers ensure that all people in this place wear face mask \ncorrectly, promote people to use a face masks and it ensure that these public \nplaces have a safe environment.",

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a self-defense tool for preventing several types of cyberattacks. Latest machine learning (ML) methods are becoming the backbone for constructing intelligent IDS that are highly data driven. This chapter proposes decision tree based IDS for the dataset NSL-KDD. A novel approach has been developed for the ranking of security features. The proposed system has been validated against performance evaluation metrics consisting of recall, precision, accuracy, and F score. The results produced by the proposed system are compared with well-known ML methods including logistic regression, support vector machines and K-nearest neighbor in order to analyse the efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The issue that is being addressed is how those who wish to be involved in film production in the future can be more educated regarding what goes into making a movie. An application was created to help these people keep track of movie props and characters and where they are placed throughout a movie. This is performed by using videos or images as input for the application, and the application uses an object detection model from MediaPipe to determine what types of objects are in a scene and where exactly they are located in the scene [4]. Then, bounding boxes are placed around the objects with the classification of the object next to each bounding box, and the result is returned. The results of the experiment indicate that the application is consistent at detecting objects when the object is fully shown on the screen. However, when the application used the cropped images as input as opposed to the full version of the image, the application was not consistently accurate, as it was not able to recognize objects that were partially cut out of the picture. More work will be needed to improve both the object detection capabilities of partially obstructed objects and the overall user interface of the application [5].",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of drug discovery and development, revolutionizing the way pharmaceutical research is conducted. This abstract provides a concise overview of the key applications and impacts of machine learning in this domain. Drug discovery and development is a complex, time-consuming, and costly process that traditionally relies on trial-and-error experimentation. Machine learning, with its ability to analyze vast datasets and extract meaningful insights, has significantly accelerated and optimized various aspects of this process. One crucial application of machine learning in drug discovery is the prediction of potential drug candidates. Machine learning models can also aid in the identification of biomarkers for diseases, enabling more targeted drug development. In the clinical trial phase, machine learning algorithms assist in patient selection, monitoring, and optimization of trial protocols. Predictive models can identify patient subpopulations most likely to respond to a particular treatment, leading to more efficient trials and better patient outcomes. Additionally, machine learning has streamlined drug repurposing efforts by identifying existing drugs with potential new applications. This approach has the potential to save significant time and resources by leveraging existing safety and efficacy data. Furthermore, machine learning enhances the drug development pipeline by optimizing drug formulation and dosage, predicting adverse reactions, and assisting in regulatory compliance. While machine learning offers tremendous promise in drug discovery and development, it also presents challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and regulatory approval. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for maximizing the potential of machine learning in the pharmaceutical industry.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nMobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students’ adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBased on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.\n",

We initially discuss key concepts in the field of AI and gain a broad overview of the field and its potential, as well as the impact it is having on multiple areas of human endeavor. Subsequently, we focus on current and projected aspects of AI as applied to diagnostic radiology, specifically on how AI might provide an avenue for error prevention and remediation in radiology. The possible impact of AI in changing the radiologist’s role and basic job description is also considered.",

However, it is difficult for a swimmer to see their progress instantly. This paper develops a tool for swimmers, specifically swimmers, to predict their future results. We applied machine learning and conducted a qualitative evaluation of the approach [3]. The results show that it is possible to determine their future performance with decent accuracy. This application considers the swimmer's performance history, age, weight, and height to predict the most accurate results.",

This work explores the various methods employed in BCI mechanisms for feature extraction, selection, and classification and provides a comparative study of reviewed methods. This paper assists the readers to gain information regarding the developments made in BCI and ML domains and future improvements needed for improving and designing better BCI applications.",

        "abstract": "On the one hand, multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have created a paradigm shift in alloy design due to large compositional space, whereas on the other, they have presented enormous computational challenges for theory-based materials design, especially density functional theory (DFT), which is inherently computationally expensive even for traditional dilute alloys. In this paper, we present a machine learning framework, namely PREDICT (PRedict properties from Existing Database In Complex alloys Territory), that opens a pathway to predict elastic constants in large compositional space with little computational expense. The framework only relies on the DFT database of binary alloys and predicts Voigt–Reuss–Hill Young’s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, elastic constants, and Poisson’s ratio in MPEAs. We show that the key descriptors of elastic constants are the A–B bond length and cohesive energy. The framework can predict elastic constants in hypothetical compositions as long as the constituent elements are present in the database, thereby enabling property exploration in multi-compositional systems. We illustrate predictions in a FCC Ni-Cu-Au-Pd-Pt system.",

In this study, we propose automating the referee decision process through machine learning. We trained neural networks to predict such decisions using data from 400 referee decisions acquired through extensive video footage reviewing and labeling. Six positional values were extracted, including the attacking player’s position, the retreating player’s position, the ball’s position in the frame, the ball’s projected first bounce, the ball’s projected second bounce, and the attacking player’s racket head position. We calculated nine additional distance values, such as the distance between players and the distance from the attacking player’s racket head to the ball’s path. Models were trained on Wolfram Mathematica and Python using these values. The best Wolfram Mathematica model and the best Python model achieved accuracies of 86% ± 3.03% and 85.2% ± 5.1%, respectively. These accuracies surpass 85%, demonstrating near-human performance. Our model has great potential for improvement as it is currently trained with limited, unbalanced data (400 decisions) and lacks crucial data points such as time and speed. The performance of our model is almost surely going to improve significantly with a larger training dataset. Unlike human referees, machine learning models follow a consistent standard, have unlimited attention spans, and make decisions instantly. If the accuracy is improved in the future, the model can potentially serve as an extra refereeing official for both professional and amateur squash matches. Both the analysis of referee decisions in squash and the proposal to automate the process using machine learning is unique to this study.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nMobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students’ adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBased on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this study, we employed a newly developed method to predict macromolecular properties using a swarm artificial neural network (ANN) method as a machine learning approach. In this method, the molecular structures are represented by the feature description vectors used as training input data for a neural network. This study aims to develop an efficient approach for training an ANN using either experimental or quantum mechanics data. We aim to introduce an error model controlling the reliability of the prediction confidence interval using a bootstrapping swarm approach. We created different datasets of selected experimental or quantum mechanics results. Using this optimized ANN, we hope to predict properties and their statistical errors for new molecules. There are four datasets used in this study. That includes the dataset of 642 small organic molecules with known experimental hydration free energies, the dataset of 1475 experimental pKa values of ionizable groups in 192 proteins, the dataset of 2693 mutants in 14 proteins with given experimental values of changes in the Gibbs free energy, and a dataset of 7101 quantum mechanics heat of formation calculations. All the data are prepared and optimized using the AMBER force field in the CHARMM macromolecular computer simulation program. The bootstrapping swarm ANN code for performing the optimization and prediction is written in Python computer programming language. The descriptor vectors of the small molecules are based on the Coulomb matrix and sum over bond properties. For the macromolecular systems, they consider the chemical-physical fingerprints of the region in the vicinity of each amino acid.",

ML is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with the primary objective to increase the efficiency and precision of medical professionals' work. AI presents a significant opportunity in the healthcare sector as most countries are now struggling with overburdened healthcare systems and a dearth of competent medical personnel. Healthcare data is expanding daily and can be utilised to choose the best study sample, gather additional data points, and assess participant data from ongoing studies. ML-based methods/algorithms are employed in the early detection and diagnosis of numerous diseases. For a very long time, early disease prediction and detection have been crucial areas of research for the diagnosis of all diseases. Machine‐learning (ML) algorithms have proven to be quite efficient in disease detection and decision making in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Electronic invoicing has been mandatory for Italian companies since January 2019. All the invoices are structured in a predefined xml template which facilitates the extraction of the information. The main aim of this paper is to exploit the information contained in electronic invoices to build an intelligent system which can simplify accountants’ work. More precisely, this contribution shows how it is possible to automate part of the accounting process: all the invoices of a company are classified into specific codes which represent the economic nature of the financial transactions. To accomplish this classification task, a multiclass classification algorithm is proposed to predict two different target variables, the account and the VAT codes, which are part of the general ledger entry. To apply this model to real datasets, a multi-step procedure is proposed: first, a matching algorithm is used for the reconstruction of the training set, then input data are elaborated and prepared for the training phase, and finally a classification algorithm is trained. Different classification algorithms are compared in terms of prediction accuracy, including ensemble models and neural networks. The models under comparison show optimal results in the prediction of the target variables, meaning that machine learning classifiers succeed in translating the complex rules of the accounting process into an automated model. A final study suggests that best performances can be achieved considering the hierarchical structure of the account codes, splitting the classification task into smaller sub-problems.",

        "abstract": "Machine-learning algorithms are widely used for cybersecurity applications, including spam, malware detection, biometric recognition. In these applications, the learning algorithm must face intelligent and adaptive attackers who can carefully manipulate data to purposely subvert the learning process. As machine learning algorithms have not been originally designed under such premises, they have been shown to be vulnerable towell-crafted attacks, including test-time evasion and training-time poisoning attacks (also known as adversarial examples).This talk aims to introduce the fundamentals of adversarial machine learning and some techniques to assess the vulnerability of machine-learning algorithms to adversarial attacks. We report application examples including object recognition in images, biometric identity recognition, spam, and malware detection.",

        "abstract": "Accurate cost estimation at the early stage of a construction project is a key factor in the success of most projects. Many difficulties arise when estimating the cost during the early design stage in customized furniture manufacturing. It is important to estimate the product cost in the earlier manufacturing phase. The cost estimation is related to the prediction of the cost, which commonly includes calculation of the materials, labor, sales, overhead, and other costs. Historical data of the previously manufactured products can be used in the cost estimation process of the new products. In this paper, we propose an early cost estimation approach, which is based on machine learning techniques. The experimental investigation based on the real customized furniture manufacturing data is performed, results are presented, and insights are given.",

        "abstract": "Skin disease is a very common disease for humans. In the medical industry detecting skin disease and recognizing its type is a very challenging task. Due to the complexity of human skin texture and the visual closeness effect of the diseases, sometimes it is really difficult to detect the exact type. Therefore, it is necessary to detect and recognize the skin disease at its very first observation. In today's era, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly growing in medical fields. Different machine learning (ML) and deep learning(DL) algorithms are used for diagnostic purposes. These methods drastically improve the diagnosis process and also speed up the process. In this paper, a brief comparison between the machine learning process and the deep learning process was discussed. In both processes, three different and popular algorithms are used. For the machine Learning process Bagged Tree Ensemble, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine(SVM) algorithms were used. For the deep learning process three pre-trained deep neural network models",

Timely and accurate predictions can help to proactively reduce human and nancial loss. This study presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to build models to predict whether it is going to rain tomorrow or not based on weather data for that particular day in major cities of Australia. This comparative study is conducted concentrating on three aspects: modeling inputs, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict the rainfall by analyzing the weather data.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>This paper will interrogate and discuss the possibility of applying machine learning technology into storyboarding processes from an animation and film industry perspective. In current animation or film production studios, most of a storyboarder's creative process is a repeating step of manually editing and visualizing content from a script. It is a storyboarders’ responsibility to analyze camera cuts and scenes information, then organize the scenes, the director's notes, and camera movements in storyboard drawing software to create a working template. The storyboarder is always responsible for hundreds of such repeating steps in storyboarding processes. Those repeating actions are all inefficient and could be limiting. This paper will analyze and review many machine learning technology methods in the current animation and film industry. The literature review part will identify many machine learning methods’ positions in the animation production pipeline and their advantages and disadvantages in related professional fields. Finally, this research paper will address a theoretical concept of applying visual recognition, text mining and automation technology into storyboarding software to analyze the scripts for storyboarders.</p>",

In respect to this aim, a literature research was presented. Used machine learning methods were explained together with their developments and structural features. Various applications were performed to predict concrete compressive strength, and then feature selection was applied to prediction model in order to determine primarily important parameters for compressive strength prediction model. Success of both models was evaluated with respect to correct and precision prediction of values with different error metrics and calculations. ",

        "abstract": "Code smell is an inherent property of software that results in design problems which makes the software hard to extend, understand, and maintain. In the literature, several tools are used to detect code smell that are informally defined or subjective in nature due to varying results of the code smell. To resolve this, machine leaning (ML) techniques are proposed and learn to distinguish the characteristics of smelly and non-smelly code elements (classes or methods). However, the dataset constructed by the ML techniques are based on the tools and manually validated code smell samples. In this article, instead of using tools and manual validation, the authors considered detection rules for identifying the smell then applied unsupervised learning for validation to construct two smell datasets. Then, applied classification algorithms are used on the datasets to detect the code smells. The researchers found that all algorithms have achieved high performance in terms of accuracy, F-measure and area under ROC, yet the tree-based classifiers are performing better than other classifiers.

Applying best in class social analytics methodology to examine the sentiments embedded with purchaser remarks, encourages both producer and individual customers. Machine learning methods such as Naïve Bayes, maximum entropy classification, Deep Neural Networks were used upon the data, extracted from some websites such as Samsung and Apple for sentiment classification. In the online business arena, the application of sentiment classification explores a great opportunity. The subsidy of such an investigation is that associations can apply the proposed social examination framework to exploit the entire social information on the web and therefore improve their proper blueprint promoting strategies corresponding business.

To make the edge and mobile devices smart, fast, and for the better quality of service (QoS), fog computing is an efficient way. Fog computing is providing the way for resource provisioning, service providers, high response time, and the best solution for mobile network traffic. In this chapter, the proposed method is for handling the fog resource management using efficient offloading mechanism. Offloading is done based on machine learning prediction technology and also by using the KNN algorithm to identify the nearest fog nodes to offload. The proposed method minimizes the energy consumption, latency and improves the QoS for edge devices, IoT devices, and mobile devices. ",

        "abstract": "The whole world today, is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. This \nsituation make people must adapt to the new normal, for example: work from \nhome, online communication, keep clean to reduce transmission of COVID-19. \nMoreover, research has found that wearing a mask is one way to reduce the risk \nof viral transmission. It makes many public places have a measure about their \ncustomer must keep a distance between people and wearing the face mask \ncorrectly. But public service providers are not feasible to thoroughly check \nwhether all a customer wear the mask or not. So, in this project, we propose \nface mask detection via webcam cameras using image recognition which is one \nof the high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. This proposed system \nconsists of three methods to detect face mask: 1) Image preprocessing 2) Face \ndetection and crop 3) Classification of face mask. This system can detection a \nface mask, not wearing a face mask and incorrect face mask. This system will \nhelp public service providers ensure that all people in this place wear face mask \ncorrectly, promote people to use a face masks and it ensure that these public \nplaces have a safe environment.",

        "abstract": "Castings that are near to net forms are made using the extremely complex manufacturing technique known as die casting. Despite the method's lengthy history—more than a century—a system engineering method for characterizing it as well as the information that each cycle of die casting can create has not yet been completed. Instead, a tiny subset of knowledge deemed to be essential for die castings has attracted the attention of industry and academia. The majority of the research that has been published on artificial intelligence in die casting has a specific focus, which restricts its usefulness and efficacy in an industrial casting. This study will examine the die casting process through the perspective of systems design and show practical uses of machine learning. In terms of technical definition and how people interact with the system, the die casting process satisfies the criteria for complex systems. The die casting system is an adaptive, self-organizing network structure, according to the technical definition.",

These methods are the basis for future AI-driven internet providers because of unparalleled precision in deep learning methodologies. Commercial firms gather large-scale user data and perform machine learning technique. The massive information necessary for machine learning raises privacy problems. The user's personal and extremely sensitive data such as photographs and voice records are gathered and retained forever by these commercial firms and users can not limit the intents of these sensitive information. In addition, centrally stored data is susceptible to legal and extrajudicial monitoring. Many data owners use profound extensive learning by security and confidentiality. This chapter contains a practical approach that allows several parties to learn a precise model of complex systems for a specific purpose without disclosing their data sets. It provides an interesting element in utility and privacy.",

This work analyzes the level of genetic similarity between several ataxias, we identified proteins that are associated with more than one ataxia. A decision tree was trained to identify ataxias by identifying whether a new entry disease not yet identified and not classified can be grouped as an ataxia. Altogether 12 proteins from different ataxias were verified, all 12 proteins were analyzed in 500 different trees to better evaluate the method used. Of the 12 proteins tested, the method was correct for 10 different proteins or 83% of correct results. This identifier and the results obtained in the experiments allow a greater characterization of the diseases addressed, it also allows applications such as the reuse of treatments for similar diseases.",

ML is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) technology with the primary objective to increase the efficiency and precision of medical professionals' work. AI presents a significant opportunity in the healthcare sector as most countries are now struggling with overburdened healthcare systems and a dearth of competent medical personnel. Healthcare data is expanding daily and can be utilised to choose the best study sample, gather additional data points, and assess participant data from ongoing studies. ML-based methods/algorithms are employed in the early detection and diagnosis of numerous diseases. For a very long time, early disease prediction and detection have been crucial areas of research for the diagnosis of all diseases. Machine‐learning (ML) algorithms have proven to be quite efficient in disease detection and decision making in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Electronic invoicing has been mandatory for Italian companies since January 2019. All the invoices are structured in a predefined xml template which facilitates the extraction of the information. The main aim of this paper is to exploit the information contained in electronic invoices to build an intelligent system which can simplify accountants’ work. More precisely, this contribution shows how it is possible to automate part of the accounting process: all the invoices of a company are classified into specific codes which represent the economic nature of the financial transactions. To accomplish this classification task, a multiclass classification algorithm is proposed to predict two different target variables, the account and the VAT codes, which are part of the general ledger entry. To apply this model to real datasets, a multi-step procedure is proposed: first, a matching algorithm is used for the reconstruction of the training set, then input data are elaborated and prepared for the training phase, and finally a classification algorithm is trained. Different classification algorithms are compared in terms of prediction accuracy, including ensemble models and neural networks. The models under comparison show optimal results in the prediction of the target variables, meaning that machine learning classifiers succeed in translating the complex rules of the accounting process into an automated model. A final study suggests that best performances can be achieved considering the hierarchical structure of the account codes, splitting the classification task into smaller sub-problems.",

Altogether 12 proteins from different ataxias were verified, all 12 proteins were analyzed in 500 different trees to better evaluate the method used. Of the 12 proteins tested, the method was correct for 10 different proteins or 83% of correct results. This identifier and the results obtained in the experiments allow a greater characterization of the diseases addressed, it also allows applications such as the reuse of treatments for similar diseases.",

Many difficulties arise when estimating the cost during the early design stage in customized furniture manufacturing. It is important to estimate the product cost in the earlier manufacturing phase. The cost estimation is related to the prediction of the cost, which commonly includes calculation of the materials, labor, sales, overhead, and other costs. Historical data of the previously manufactured products can be used in the cost estimation process of the new products. In this paper, we propose an early cost estimation approach, which is based on machine learning techniques. The experimental investigation based on the real customized furniture manufacturing data is performed, results are presented, and insights are given.",

        "abstract": "Artificial neural networks can learn complex, salient data features to achieve a given task. On the opposite end of the spectrum, mathematically grounded methods such as topological data analysis allow users to design analysis pipelines fully aware of data constraints and symmetries. We introduce an original class of neural network layers based on a generalization of topological persistence. The proposed persistence-based layers allow the users to encode specific data properties (e.g., equivariance) easily. Additionally, these layers can be trained through standard optimization procedures (backpropagation) and composed with classical layers. We test the performance of generalized persistence-based layers as pooling operators in convolutional neural networks for image classification on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.",

        "abstract": "Measuring the performance of solar energy and heat transfer systems requires a lot of time, economic cost, and manpower. Meanwhile, directly predicting their performance is challenging due to the complicated internal structures. Fortunately, a knowledge-based machine learning method can provide a promising prediction and optimization strategy for the performance of energy systems. In this chapter, the authors show how they utilize the machine learning models trained from a large experimental database to perform precise prediction and optimization on a solar water heater (SWH) system. A new energy system optimization strategy based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) process is proposed. This chapter consists of: 1) comparative studies on varieties of machine learning models (artificial neural networks [ANNs], support vector machine [SVM], and extreme learning machine [ELM]) to predict the performances of SWHs; 2) development of an ANN-based software to assist the quick prediction; and 3) introduction of a computational HTS method to design a high-performance SWH system.

Traditional methods for exoplanet identification include the wobble method, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, etc., which not only require a considerable investment of manpower, time, and money, but also are limited by the performance of astronomical telescopes. In this study, we proposed the idea of using machine learning methods to identify exoplanets. We used the Kepler dataset collected by NASA from the Kepler Space Observatory to conduct supervised learning, which predicts the existence of exoplanet candidates as a three-categorical classification task, using decision tree, random forest, naïve Bayes, and neural network; we used another NASA dataset consisted of the confirmed exoplanets data to conduct unsupervised learning, which divides the confirmed exoplanets into different clusters, using k-means clustering. As a result, our models achieved accuracies of 99.06%, 92.11%, 88.50%, and 99.79%, respectively, in the supervised learning task and successfully obtained reasonable clusters in the unsupervised learning task.",

        "abstract": "One of the main reasons for deaths in children or low-age kids is congenital heart disease detected by CDSS (clinical decision support system). If it's diagnosed at an early stage, the significant results can be obtained for life-saving. The practitioners are not equally qualified and skilled so the detection of the disease and the proper diagnosis is delayed. The best prevention is the early detection of the symptoms of this disease. An automated medical diagnosis system is made to improve the accuracy and diagnose the disease. CHD expands the heart deformation as in newborn babies. Early detection of CHD is necessary to detect and diagnose this disease. Due to this, the life of a newborn child is in danger. By different detection methods, CHD could be accomplished by its clinical information using CDSS and it is also detected by its nonclinical data. In pregnant ladies, CHD is diagnosed by their non-clinical data by applying it to the newborn baby that is in their womb. Due to this, different machine learning algorithms, including K-NN and MLP, are explored. For CHD detection, dataset selection is a big issue, and it is utilized by the Support Vector Machine and random forest, K-NN, and MLP algorithms. This proposed work develops a decision support system to detect congenital heart disease. In this proposed work, the data mining techniques and the machine learning algorithms are used to gain insight into the system for their accuracy rate. This proposed work is designed and developed by the Python jupyter notebook to implement MLP. This paper presents an analysis using the machine learning algorithm to develop an accurate and efficient model for heart disease prediction. The MLP models have a high accuracy of 97%.",

There are two related software engineering research issues about reliability requirements. The first issue is achieving the necessary reliability, i.e., choosing and employing appropriate software engineering techniques in system design and implementation. The second issue is the assessment of reliability as a method of assurance that precedes system deployment. In past few years, various software reliability models have been introduced. These models have been developed in response to the need of software engineers, system engineers and managers to quantify the concept of software reliability. This chapter on software reliability prediction using ANNs addresses three main issues: (1) analyze, manage, and improve the reliability of software products; (2) satisfy the customer needs for competitive price, on time delivery, and reliable software product; (3) determine the software release instance that is, when the software is good enough to release to the customer.

This chapter delves into the confluence of ML and geotechnical engineering, spotlighting its enhanced predictive capabilities regarding soil behaviors, landslides, and structural resilience. Harnessing modern datasets and rich case studies, we offer an exhaustive examination that highlights the transformative role of ML in reshaping geotechnical risk assessment practices.

        "abstract": "Many types of physical unclonable function (PUF) structures have been proposed in the last decade. The responses generated from the conventional PUF are vulnerable to attack. In this chapter, the transient effect of ring oscillator structure has been used. This works on two loops with complex loops containing NOT gates and NAND gates. Response prediction of these loops is a very difficult task for the adversary. Many machine learning algorithms may produce the responses with higher accuracies. This study provides new masked PUF architectures that are more secure and invulnerable to modeling attacks. Hence, in this chapter, masking-based configurability design on various PUF structures is introduced. This will be helpful for resource-constrained machines. For different sizes of challenge-response pair, machine learning techniques need to be changed, but prediction accuracy by the attacker should be low. By using this kind of masked PUF structure, 54.7% uniqueness can be obtained, and 97.5% reliability can be achieved. Machine learning accuracy is 70.7% with SVM and 63.67% accuracy in LR.",

Instead, a tiny subset of knowledge deemed to be essential for die castings has attracted the attention of industry and academia. The majority of the research that has been published on artificial intelligence in die casting has a specific focus, which restricts its usefulness and efficacy in an industrial casting. This study will examine the die casting process through the perspective of systems design and show practical uses of machine learning. In terms of technical definition and how people interact with the system, the die casting process satisfies the criteria for complex systems.

        "abstract": "Spam on the online social networks (OSNs) is evolving as a prominent problem for the users of these networks. Spammers often use certain techniques to deceive the OSN users for their own benefit. Facebook, one of the leading OSNs, is experiencing such crucial problems at an alarming rate. This chapter presents a methodology to segregate spam from legitimate posts using machine learning techniques: naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The textual, image, and video features are used together, which wasn't considered by the earlier researchers. Then, 1.5 million posts and comments are extracted from archival and real-time Facebook data, which is then pre-processed using RStudio. A total of 30 features are identified, out of which 10 are the best informative for identification of spam vs. ham posts. The entire dataset is shuffled and divided into three ratios, out of which 80:20 ratio of training and testing dataset provides the best result. Also, RF classifier outperforms NB and SVM by achieving overall F-measure 89.4% on the combined feature set. ",

To address these challenges, the authors are proposing the drug prediction model that will act as informative guide for patients and help them for taking right medicines for the cure of particular disease. In this chapter, the authors are proposing use of Hadoop distributed file system for the storage of medical datasets related to medicinal drugs. MLLib Library of Apache Spark is to be used for initial data analysis for drug suggestions related to symptoms gathered from particular user. The model will analyze the previous history of patients for any side effects of the drug to be recommended. This proposal will consider weather and maps API from Google as well so that the patients can easily locate the nearby stores where the medicines will be available. It is believed that this proposal of research will surely eradicate the issues by prescribing the optimal drug and its availability by giving the location of the retailer of that drug near the customer.

        "abstract": "&nbsp;Electrocardiogram signal analysis is very difficult to classify cardiac\narrhythmia using machine learning methods. The ECG datasets normally come with\nmultiple missing values. The reason for the missing values is the faults or distortion.\nWhen performing data mining, missing value imputation is the biggest task for data\npreprocessing. This problem could arise due to incomplete medical datasets if the\nincomplete missing values and cases were removed from the original database. To\nproduce a good quality dataset for better analyzing the clinical trials, the suitable\nmissing value imputation method is used. In this paper, we explore the different\nmachine-learning techniques for the computed missing value in the electrocardiogram\ndataset. To estimate the missing imputation values, the collected data contains feature\ndimensions with their attributes. The experiments to compute the missing values in the\ndataset are carried out by using the four feature selection methods and imputation\nmethods. The implemented results are shown by combined features using IG\n(information gain), GA (genetic algorithm) and the different machine learning\nclassifiers such as NB (naïve bayes), KNN (K-nearest neighbor), MLP (Multilayer\nperception), and RF (Random forest). The GA (genetic algorithm) and IG (information\ngain) are the best suitable methods for obtaining the results on lower dimensional\ndatasets with RMSE (Root mean square error. It efficiently calculates the best results\nfor missing values. These four classifiers are used to analyze the impact of imputation\nmethods. The best results for missing rate 10% to 40% are obtained by NB that is\n0.657, 0.6541, 0.66, 0.657, and 0.657, as computed by RMSE (Root mean Square\nerror). It means that error will efficiently reduced by naïve bayes classifier.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new lightweight handshake protocol implemented on top of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that can be used in device discovery and ensuring the IoT network security by autonomously managing devices of any computational complexity using whitelisting and blacklisting. A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is utilized for the session key generation in the proposed handshake protocol. The CoAP server performs real-time device discovery using the proposed handshake protocol, and anomaly detection using machinelearning algorithms to ensure the security of the IoT network. To the best of our knowledge, the presented PUF-based handshake protocol is the first to performs blacklisting and whitelisting. Whitelisted IoT devices not displaying anomalous behavior can join and remain in the IoT network. IoT devices that display anomalous behavior are autonomously blacklisted by the CoAP server and are either disallowed from joining the IoT network or are removed from the IoT network. Simulation results show that amongst the five machine learning algorithms studied, the stacking classifier displays the highest overall anomaly detection accuracy of 99.98%. Based on the results of the network simulation performed, the CoAP server is capable of blacklisting malicious IoT devices within the network with perfect accuracy.",

From there, they use unplanned intensive care unit readmission predictions in tackling the three main challenges of machine learning-based healthcare decision support systems. They investigate the data complexity issue by adopting dimension reduction techniques on patients' medical records to integrate patients' chart events, demographics, and the ICD-9 code. To address the decision criticality issue, they perform an in-depth deep learning performance analysis, and they analyze each feature's contribution to the predictive model. To unpack the model explainability issue, they illustrate the importance of each input feature and its combinations in the predictive model.",

The massive wastage of water occurs due to irregular\nheavy rainfall and water released from dams. To avoid this, the proposal suggests an idea\nto develop a watershed and to predict the water level measurement by Bayesian\nclassification, clustering, and optimization techniques. Artificial Neural Network is one of\nthe previous techniques used to predict water level which gives approximate result only. To\novercome the disadvantage, this proposal suggests an idea to develop the watershed by\nusing different machine learning techniques.\nThe level of water that can be stored is calculated using Bayes Network which will classify\nthe data into labels according to the condition of the capacity of the minimum and\nmaximum storage level of the watershed. The standardized data considered for the\nclassification are normalized using the z-score normalization. Classification will represent\nthe result by means of the instances that are correctly classified. The output of the\nclassified data is fed into clustering algorithm where the labels are grouped into different\nclusters. The K-Mean algorithm is utilized for clustering which iteratively assign data point\nto one of the k group according to the given attribute. The clustered output gives the result\nof how many instances are correctly clustered. The clustered output will be refined for\nfurther process such that the data will be extracted as ordered dataset of year wise and\nmonth wise data.\nFor the extracted data gradient descent algorithm is applied for reducing the error and\npredicting the amount of water stored in watershed for upcoming years by means of\ncalculating the actual and prediction value. Later the result will be visualized in the form\nof graph. The obtained output is considered as an input for posterior probability that uses\nJ48 algorithm which gives the result of probability of event happened after all the evidence\nis taken for consideration and gives the accurate result. The above methodology provides\nhigh performance and efficient result.",

        "abstract": "Machine  Learning  techniques  and  applications  have  lately  gained  a  lot  of  interest  in  many  areas,  including  spheres  of   arithmetic, finances, engineering, dialectology, and a lot more. This is owing to the upwelling of ground-breaking and  sophisticated machine learning procedures to exceedingly multifaceted complications along with the prevailing advances  in  high  speed  computing.  Numerous  usages  of  Machine  learning  in  daily  life  include  pattern  recognition,  automation,  data   processing  and  analysis,  and  so  on.  The  Petroleum  industry  is  not  lagging  behind  also.  On  the  contrary,  machine  learning   approaches have lately been applied to enhance production, forecast recoverable hydrocarbons, augment well placement  by means of pattern recognition, optimize hydraulic fracture design, and to help in reservoir characterization. In this paper,  three different machine learning models were trained and utilized to explore the feasibility of forecasting pore pressure of a  well. The machine learning algorithms include, Simple Linear Regression, Decision Stump and Multilayer Perceptron (ANN).  The predictive accuracies of the algorithm was analyzed using statistical measures. Five (5) parameters were utilized as input  variables in the models: hydrostatic pressure, overburden pressure, observed and normal sonic velocities and pore pressure.  80% of the data was used in training while the remaining 20% was used for testing of the models. A sensitivity analysis of  the five variable was conducted so as to identify correlations of the variables. Results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that  both hydrostatic and overburden pressures appear to have the strongest correlation with pore pressure (0.766) and closely  followed by normal compacted sonic velocity (0.753). Meanwhile, observed sonic velocity has the least correlation (0.046).  The models were appraised by determining their Relative Absolute Errors. Results indicate that Multilayer Perceptron has  the best prediction and least Relative Absolute Error of 5.77%. While the Decision Stump model had a Relative absolute error  of 54.41%. The Simple Linear Regression had a relative absolute error of 67.93%. By and large, all three models appear to be  suitable for modeling pore pressure but the Multilayer Perceptron is the most accurate.",

Surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remain the major treatment for tongue cancer. The treatment effect is determined by patients’ survival status. Previous studies have identified certain survival and risk factors based on descriptive statistics, ignoring the complex, nonlinear relationship among clinical and demographic variables. In this study, we utilize five cutting-edge machine learning models and clinical data to predict the survival of tongue cancer patients after treatment. Five-fold cross-validation, bootstrap analysis, and permutation feature importance are applied to estimate and interpret model performance. The prognostic factors identified by our method are consistent with previous clinical studies. Our method is accurate, interpretable, and thus useable as additional evidence in tongue cancer treatment and management.",

Meanwhile, directly predicting their performance is challenging due to the complicated internal structures. Fortunately, a knowledge-based machine learning method can provide a promising prediction and optimization strategy for the performance of energy systems. In this chapter, the authors show how they utilize the machine learning models trained from a large experimental database to perform precise prediction and optimization on a solar water heater (SWH) system. A new energy system optimization strategy based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) process is proposed. This chapter consists of: 1) comparative studies on varieties of machine learning models (artificial neural networks [ANNs], support vector machine [SVM], and extreme learning machine [ELM]) to predict the performances of SWHs; 2) development of an ANN-based software to assist the quick prediction; and 3) introduction of a computational HTS method to design a high-performance SWH system.

Traditional methods for exoplanet identification include the wobble method, direct imaging, gravitational microlensing, etc., which not only require a considerable investment of manpower, time, and money, but also are limited by the performance of astronomical telescopes. In this study, we proposed the idea of using machine learning methods to identify exoplanets. We used the Kepler dataset collected by NASA from the Kepler Space Observatory to conduct supervised learning, which predicts the existence of exoplanet candidates as a three-categorical classification task, using decision tree, random forest, naïve Bayes, and neural network; we used another NASA dataset consisted of the confirmed exoplanets data to conduct unsupervised learning, which divides the confirmed exoplanets into different clusters, using k-means clustering. As a result, our models achieved accuracies of 99.06%, 92.11%, 88.50%, and 99.79%, respectively, in the supervised learning task and successfully obtained reasonable clusters in the unsupervised learning task.",

        "abstract": "One of the main reasons for deaths in children or low-age kids is congenital heart disease detected by CDSS (clinical decision support system). If it's diagnosed at an early stage, the significant results can be obtained for life-saving. The practitioners are not equally qualified and skilled so the detection of the disease and the proper diagnosis is delayed. The best prevention is the early detection of the symptoms of this disease. An automated medical diagnosis system is made to improve the accuracy and diagnose the disease. CHD expands the heart deformation as in newborn babies. Early detection of CHD is necessary to detect and diagnose this disease. Due to this, the life of a newborn child is in danger. By different detection methods, CHD could be accomplished by its clinical information using CDSS and it is also detected by its nonclinical data. In pregnant ladies, CHD is diagnosed by their non-clinical data by applying it to the newborn baby that is in their womb. Due to this, different machine learning algorithms, including K-NN and MLP, are explored. For CHD detection, dataset selection is a big issue, and it is utilized by the Support Vector Machine and random forest, K-NN, and MLP algorithms. This proposed work develops a decision support system to detect congenital heart disease. In this proposed work, the data mining techniques and the machine learning algorithms are used to gain insight into the system for their accuracy rate. This proposed work is designed and developed by the Python jupyter notebook to implement MLP. This paper presents an analysis using the machine learning algorithm to develop an accurate and efficient model for heart disease prediction. The MLP models have a high accuracy of 97%.",

There are two related software engineering research issues about reliability requirements. The first issue is achieving the necessary reliability, i.e., choosing and employing appropriate software engineering techniques in system design and implementation. The second issue is the assessment of reliability as a method of assurance that precedes system deployment. In past few years, various software reliability models have been introduced. These models have been developed in response to the need of software engineers, system engineers and managers to quantify the concept of software reliability. This chapter on software reliability prediction using ANNs addresses three main issues: (1) analyze, manage, and improve the reliability of software products; (2) satisfy the customer needs for competitive price, on time delivery, and reliable software product; (3) determine the software release instance that is, when the software is good enough to release to the customer.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, mathematically grounded methods such as topological data analysis allow users to design analysis pipelines fully aware of data constraints and symmetries.

The proposed persistence-based layers allow the users to encode specific data properties (e.g., equivariance) easily. Additionally, these layers can be trained through standard optimization procedures (backpropagation) and composed with classical layers. We test the performance of generalized persistence-based layers as pooling operators in convolutional neural networks for image classification on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.",

        "abstract": "Dimension reduction is one of the oldest concerns in geographical analysis. Despite significant, longstanding attention in geographical problems, recent advances in non-linear techniques for dimension reduction, called manifold learning, have not been adopted in classic data-intensive geographical problems. More generally, machine learning methods for geographical problems often focus more on applying standard machine learning algorithms to geographic data, rather than applying true \"spatially-correlated learning,\" in the words of Kohonen. As such, we suggest a general way to incentivize geographical learning in machine learning algorithms, and link it to many past methods that introduced geography into statistical techniques. We develop a specific instance of this by specifying two geographical variants of Isomap, a non-linear dimension reduction, or \"manifold learning,\" technique. We also provide a method for assessing what is added by incorporating geography and estimate the manifold's intrinsic geographic scale. To illustrate the concepts and provide interpretable results, we conducting a dimension reduction on geographical and high-dimensional structure of social and economic data on Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this paper's main endeavor--defining and explaining a way to \"geographize\" many machine learning methods--yields interesting and novel results for manifold learning the estimation of intrinsic geographical scale in unsupervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Many types of physical unclonable function (PUF) structures have been proposed in the last decade. The responses generated from the conventional PUF are vulnerable to attack. In this chapter, the transient effect of ring oscillator structure has been used. This works on two loops with complex loops containing NOT gates and NAND gates. Response prediction of these loops is a very difficult task for the adversary. Many machine learning algorithms may produce the responses with higher accuracies. This study provides new masked PUF architectures that are more secure and invulnerable to modeling attacks. Hence, in this chapter, masking-based configurability design on various PUF structures is introduced. This will be helpful for resource-constrained machines. For different sizes of challenge-response pair, machine learning techniques need to be changed, but prediction accuracy by the attacker should be low. By using this kind of masked PUF structure, 54.7% uniqueness can be obtained, and 97.5% reliability can be achieved. Machine learning accuracy is 70.7% with SVM and 63.67% accuracy in LR.",

They need to spend a lot of time manually collecting and sorting information. Especially when the information of the school may be constantly updated, the information may become very inaccurate for international applicants. we designed a tool including three main steps to solve the problem: crawling links, processing web pages, and building my pages. In compiling languages, we mainly use Python and store the crawled data in JSON format [4]. In the process of crawling links, we mainly used beautiful soup to parse HTML and designed crawler.  In this paper, we use Python language to design a system. First, we use the crawler method to fetch all the links related to the admission information on the school's official website. Then we traverse these links, and use the noise_remove [5] method to process their corresponding page contents, so as to further narrow the scope of effective information and save these processed contents in the JSON files. Finally, we use the Flask framework to integrate these contents into my front-end page conveniently and efficiently, so that it has the complete function of integrating and displaying information.",

        "abstract": "In the contexts of deep learning (DL) considered in artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, relevant machine learning (ML) algorithms adopted refer to using a class of deep artificial neural network (ANN) that supports a learning process exercised with an enormous set of input data (labeled and/or unlabeled) so to predict at the output details on accurate features of labeled data present in the input data set.\r\nIn the present study, a deep ANN is proposed thereof conceived with certain novel considerations: The proposed deep architecture consists of a large number of consequently placed structures of paired-layers. Each layer hosts identical number of neuronal units for computation and the neuronal units are massively interconnected across the entire network. Further, each paired-layer is independently subjected to unsupervised learning (USL). Hence, commencing from the input layer-pair, the excitatory (input) data supplied flows across the interconnected neurons of paired layers, terminating eventually at the final pair of layers, where the output is recovered. That is, the converged neuronal states at any given pair is iteratively passed on to the next pair and so on. The USL suite involves collectively gathering the details of neural information across a pair of the layers constituting the network. This summed data is then limited with a specific choice of a squashing (sigmoidal) function; and, the resulting scaled value is used to adjust the coefficients of interconnection weights seeking a convergence criterion. The associated learning rate on weight adjustment is uniquely designed to facilitate fast learning towards convergence. The unique aspects of deep learning proposed here refer to: (i) Deducing the learning coefficient with a compatible algorithm so as to realize a fast convergence; and, (ii) the adopted sigmoidal function in the USL loop conforms to the heuristics of the so-called Langevin-Neelakanta machine. The paper describes the proposed deep ANN architecture with necessary details on structural considerations, sigmoidal selection, prescribing required learning rate and operational (training and predictive phase) routines. Results are furnished to demonstrate the performance efficacy of the test ANN.",

        "abstract": "This chapter explores the fast-developing topic of automated machine learning (AutoML), which aims to democratize and streamline the machine learning process. We examine the idea of AutoML and its importance in lowering the entry barriers for machine learning so that people with different degrees of competence can use it. TPOT (Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool) and Auto-sklearn, two prominent AutoML tools, are thoroughly investigated. While Auto-sklearn makes efficient use of Bayesian optimization, TPOT uses genetic programming to automate the development and optimization of machine learning pipelines. For those wishing to employ these potent tools in their machine learning projects, we also evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of AutoML while offering real-world use cases and automation advice.",

        "abstract": "In this article, the authors investigate the development of sensor data fusion-based emotion detection models. They use direct and continuous sensor data to construct emotion prediction models. They use sensor data fusion involving the environmental and physiological signals. This article integrates on-body physiological markers, surrounding sensory data, and emotion measurements to achieve the following goals: 1) collecting in the wild data set of multiple sensors; 2) using data fusion, feature fusion, and decision fusion for emotion recognition; 3) prediction of emotional states based on fusing environmental and physiological variables; 4) developing subject-dependent emotion detection models. To achieve that, they have done a real-world study “in the wild” with physiological and mobile sensors. The datasets come from participants walking around Minia University campus. The authors compared the obtained results to choose the best-performing model. Results show that D Tand RF outperforms SVM and KNN significantly by 1% or 2% (p &lt;0.01) with an average accuracy of 0.97%.",

It would be of great benefit to farmers to be able to utilize the current technology in order to leverage the challenges facing agricultural production and hence improve crop production and operation profitability. In this work, we designed and implemented a user-friendly smartphone-based plant disease detection and treatment recommendation system using machine learning (ML) techniques. CNN was used for feature extraction while the ANN and KNN were used to classify the plant diseases; a content-based filtering recommendation algorithm was used to suggest relevant treatments for the detected plant diseases after classification. The result of the implementation shows that the system correctly detected and recommended treatment for plant diseases",

Different algorithms that can be used within machine learning, depending on the nature of the variables, are discussed, and appropriate statistical techniques for modeling them are presented in this chapter.

        "abstract": "In this chapter, machine learning techniques are applied to examine consumer food choices, specifically purchasing patterns in relation to fresh fruit and vegetables. This product category contributes some of the highest profit margins for supermarkets, making understanding consumer choices in that category important not just for health but also economic reasons. Several unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, including hierarchical clustering, latent class analysis, linear regression, artificial neural networks, and deep learning neural networks, are illustrated using Nielsen Consumer Panel Dataset, a large and high-quality source of information on consumer purchases in the United States. The main finding from the clustering analysis is that households who buy less fresh produce are those with children – an important insight with significant public health implications. The main outcome from predictive modelling of spending on fresh fruit and vegetables is that contrary to expectations, neural networks failed to outperform a linear regression model. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractQuantum machine learning has emerged as an exciting and promising paradigm inside quantum technologies. It may permit, on the one hand, to carry out more efficient machine learning calculations by means of quantum devices, while, on the other hand, to employ machine learning techniques to better control quantum systems. Inside quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning aims at developing ‘intelligent’ quantum agents that may interact with the outer world and adapt to it, with the strategy of achieving some final goal. Another paradigm inside quantum machine learning is that of quantum autoencoders, which may allow one for employing fewer resources in a quantum device via a training process. Moreover, the field of quantum biomimetics aims at establishing analogies between biological and quantum systems, to look for previously inadvertent connections that may enable useful applications. Two recent examples are the concepts of quantum artificial life, as well as of quantum memristors. In this Perspective, we give an overview of these topics, describing the related research carried out by the scientific community.",

        "abstract": "An auction-based cloud model is followed in the spot pricing mechanism, where the spot instances charge changes with time. The user is bound to pay for the time that is initially initiated. If the user terminates before the sessional hourly completion, then the customer will be billed on the entire hourly session. In case Amazon terminates the instance then the customer would not be billed for the partial hour. When the current spot price reduces to bid price without any notification the cloud provider terminates the spot instance, it is a big disadvantage to the time of the availability factor, which is highly important. Therefore, it is crucial for the bidder to forecast before engaging the bids for spot prices. This paper represents a technique to analyze and predict the spot prices for instances using machine learning. It also discusses implementation, explored factors in detail, and outcomes on numerous instances of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This technique reduces efforts and errors for forecasting prices.",

The abundance of data available serves as the motivation for this. This data can be exploited for a good deal of knowledge. In this article, we focus on operational data of networking devices that are deployed in different locations. This data can be used to predict faults in the devices. Usually, after the deployment of networking devices in customer site, troubleshooting these devices is difficult. Operational data of these devices is needed for this process. Manually analysing the machined produced operational data is tedious and complex due to enormity of data. Using machine learning techniques will be of greater help here as this will help automate the troubleshooting process, avoid human errors and save time for the technical solutions engineers. ",

        "abstract": "Because of the differences in the structure and content of each website, it is often difficult for international applicants to obtain the application information of each school in time. They need to spend a lot of time manually collecting and sorting information. Especially when the information of the school may be constantly updated, the information may become very inaccurate for international applicants. we designed a tool including three main steps to solve the problem: crawling links, processing web pages, and building my pages. In compiling languages, we mainly use Python and store the crawled data in JSON format [4]. In the process of crawling links, we mainly used beautiful soup to parse HTML and designed crawler.  In this paper, we use Python language to design a system. First, we use the crawler method to fetch all the links related to the admission information on the school's official website. Then we traverse these links, and use the noise_remove [5] method to process their corresponding page contents, so as to further narrow the scope of effective information and save these processed contents in the JSON files. Finally, we use the Flask framework to integrate these contents into my front-end page conveniently and efficiently, so that it has the complete function of integrating and displaying information.",

        "abstract": "In the contexts of deep learning (DL) considered in artificial intelligence (AI) efforts, relevant machine learning (ML) algorithms adopted refer to using a class of deep artificial neural network (ANN) that supports a learning process exercised with an enormous set of input data (labeled and/or unlabeled) so to predict at the output details on accurate features of labeled data present in the input data set.\r\nIn the present study, a deep ANN is proposed thereof conceived with certain novel considerations: The proposed deep architecture consists of a large number of consequently placed structures of paired-layers. Each layer hosts identical number of neuronal units for computation and the neuronal units are massively interconnected across the entire network. Further, each paired-layer is independently subjected to unsupervised learning (USL). Hence, commencing from the input layer-pair, the excitatory (input) data supplied flows across the interconnected neurons of paired layers, terminating eventually at the final pair of layers, where the output is recovered. That is, the converged neuronal states at any given pair is iteratively passed on to the next pair and so on. The USL suite involves collectively gathering the details of neural information across a pair of the layers constituting the network. This summed data is then limited with a specific choice of a squashing (sigmoidal) function; and, the resulting scaled value is used to adjust the coefficients of interconnection weights seeking a convergence criterion. The associated learning rate on weight adjustment is uniquely designed to facilitate fast learning towards convergence. The unique aspects of deep learning proposed here refer to: (i) Deducing the learning coefficient with a compatible algorithm so as to realize a fast convergence; and, (ii) the adopted sigmoidal function in the USL loop conforms to the heuristics of the so-called Langevin-Neelakanta machine. The paper describes the proposed deep ANN architecture with necessary details on structural considerations, sigmoidal selection, prescribing required learning rate and operational (training and predictive phase) routines. Results are furnished to demonstrate the performance efficacy of the test ANN.",

They use direct and continuous sensor data to construct emotion prediction models. They use sensor data fusion involving the environmental and physiological signals. This article integrates on-body physiological markers, surrounding sensory data, and emotion measurements to achieve the following goals: 1) collecting in the wild data set of multiple sensors; 2) using data fusion, feature fusion, and decision fusion for emotion recognition; 3) prediction of emotional states based on fusing environmental and physiological variables; 4) developing subject-dependent emotion detection models. To achieve that, they have done a real-world study “in the wild” with physiological and mobile sensors. The datasets come from participants walking around Minia University campus. The authors compared the obtained results to choose the best-performing model. Results show that D Tand RF outperforms SVM and KNN significantly by 1% or 2% (p &lt;0.01) with an average accuracy of 0.97%.",

TPOT (Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool) and Auto-sklearn, two prominent AutoML tools, are thoroughly investigated. While Auto-sklearn makes efficient use of Bayesian optimization, TPOT uses genetic programming to automate the development and optimization of machine learning pipelines. For those wishing to employ these potent tools in their machine learning projects, we also evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of AutoML while offering real-world use cases and automation advice.",

However, cement production is recognised as a major source of many environmental problems, including air and water pollution. This paper, therefore, focused on the partial replacement (from 0 to 40%) of cement in the mortars with industrial by-products and on the application of ultrasonic waves as a sensing approach to evaluate the mechanical properties of the new cement mortar. The compressive strength of the eco-friendly mortar was measured at ages of 7, 14, and 28 days, and the results showed the best compressive strength of the eco-friendly mortar was 19.8 MPa at 28 days compared to 23.9 MPa of the reference mix. Additionally, a good agreement was noticed between the ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and the compressive strength confirming the applicability of the UPV for compressive strength sensing.",

        "abstract": "The weather data generated, processed, and collected by the sensor or shared by IoT devices and mobile devices has significantly increased weather data collection in daily life. The data generation speed also accelerated, and a vast amount of data has been collected and stored in distributed databases, improving weather forecasting. Still, the conventional processing method for massive data is distributed and centralized computing, and this chapter looks into how distributed machine learning techniques help as to increase the processing speed. Some distributed frameworks that play a significant role in massive data, like MapReduce, have been trained and tested to resolve various machine learning problems in a distributed environment. The aim of this chapter will provide different information about datasets, issues, platforms, and optimized approaches in a distributed environment. So, researchers can use and deploy new techniques in machine learning algorithms. It helps the researchers develop new strategies in distributed computing environments.",

Hence, malware discovery is a significant component in the security of PC frameworks. These days, assailants by and large plan polymeric malware, it is typically a kind of malware that ceaselessly changes its unmistakable component to trick recognition strategies that utilizes run of the mill signature-based techniques. For that reason, the requirement for Machine Learning based identification emerges. In this work, we will acquire standard of conduct that might be accomplished through static or dynamic examination, a while later we can apply unique ML strategies to recognize regardless of whether it's malware. Conduct based Detection techniques will be talked about to take advantage from ML calculations in order to approach social-based malware acknowledgment, furthermore, grouping model. In this paper, study related between two major components. First one is machine learning algorithm apply on data set directly. Second is same Machine learning algorithm apply with Data science pre-processing steps.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is one of the fast-growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. There are several applications for machine learning. The most significant of which is supervised learning. Supervised learning is common in classification problems. In this study, frequently used twelve machine learning algorithms are considered: NB, LDA, LR, ANN, SVM, K-NN, HT, DT, C4.5, CART, RF and BB. We apply these algorithms on seven datasets. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms on both binary and multiple classification problems using a variety of performance metrics: accuracy, kappa statistic, precision, recall, specificity, F-measure, MAE, RMSE and MCC. Here, we found that RF algorithm proved to have the best performance in three out of seven datasets. But the other four algorithms: NN, NB, BB and LR also performed well.",

        "abstract": "The mixture of the traditional cement mortar is mainly made from three components; ordinary Portland cement (OPC), sand and water. However, the OPC has many proven adverse effects on the environment and economy, such as harmful emissions and depletion of natural sources. Therefore, some studies try to minimise the use of OPC in cement mortar by providing and testing some alternatives, such as Cement Kiln Dust (CKD). The available studies confirm the applicability of CKD as a promising alternative to OPC in cement mortar. This study will explore the effects of different percentages of CKD (10-30% of OPC amount) on the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) in the cement mortar's properties. This study showed that adding CKD as a partial replacement for OPC decreases the UPV compared to the reference sample.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning merupakan sistem yang mampu belajar sendiri untuk memutuskan sesuatu tanpa harus berulangkali diprogram oleh manusia sehingga komputer menjadi semakin cerdas berlajar dari pengalaman data yang dimiliki. Berdasarkan teknik pembelajarannya, dapat dibedakan supervised learning menggunakan dataset (data training) yang sudah berlabel, sedangkan unsupervised learning menarik kesimpulan berdasarkan dataset. Input berupa dataset digunakan pembelajaran mesin untuk menghasilkan analisis yang benar. Penyelesaian digunakan Python yang menyediakan algoritma dan library yang digunakan membuat machine learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) dan machine learning saat ini kembali memasuki fase booming setelah beberapa dekade mengalami pasang surut. Kecerdasan Buatan kembali digandrungi, dimana penerapannya dilakukan secara masive pada aplikasi-aplikasi bisnis dan social media jaman now seperti Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, dan bahkan berbagai aplikasi besar dari Indonesia seperti Go-jek, Tokopedia, dan sebagainya. Struktur pembahasan dalam buku ini meliputi 3 bagian besar yaitu (1) Konsep Machine Learning dan Kecerdasan Buatan (2) Dasar-Dasar Pemrograman Python untuk Machine Learning serta (3) Contoh Penerapan Machine Learning Menggunakan Python dengan menerapkan beberapa algoritma baik Supervised maupun Unsupervised Learning. Beberapa studi kasus dibahas secara lengkap dari pemahaman algoritma, mengolah dataset sampai pada training dan testing serta visualisasi hasil dari model machine learning yang dikembangkan.",

Deep learning holds many potential advantages when it comes to modelling highly non-linear data, as well as speed improvements when compared to traditional analysis and modelling techniques.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One such problem is the identification and de-trending of stellar and systematic instrument noise in exoplanet lightcurves and in particular time-resolved spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As part of the ESA Ariel Space mission and the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML-PKDD), we have organised two very successful machine learning challenges in 2019 and 2021 (https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space).&amp;#160; The aim was to provide new solutions to traditionally intractable problems and to foster closer collaboration between the exoplanet and machine learning communities. Often interdisciplinary approaches to long-standing problems are thwarted by jargon and a lack of familiarity. Data challenges are an excellent way to break down existing barriers and establish new links and collaborations.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The top-ranked approaches range from deep-learning to gradient boosted extreme learning machines. In this presentation, I will discuss their pros and cons of solving the set challenge and show how new ideas generated by the data challenges can achieve real progress in the field.&lt;/div&gt;",

        "abstract": "This work presents a variant of an electrostatic embedding scheme that allows the embedding of arbitrary machine learned potentials trained on molecular systems in vacuo. The scheme is based on physically motivated models of electronic density and polarizability, resulting in a generic model without relying on an exhaustive training set. The scheme only requires in vacuo single point QM calculations to provide training densities and molecular dipolar polarizabilities. As an example, the scheme is applied to create an embedding model for the QM7 dataset using Gaussian Process Regression with only 445 reference atomic environments. The model was tested on SARS-CoV-2 protease complex with PF-00835231, resulting in predicted embedding energy RMSE of 2 kcal/mol, compared to explicit DFT/MM calculations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing allow biologists to observe cell function with unprecedented resolution, but the resulting datasets are too large and complicated for humans to understand without the aid of advanced statistical methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are designed to automatically find patterns in data, are well suited to this task. Yet these models are often so complex as to be opaque, leaving researchers with few clues about underlying mechanisms. Interpretable machine learning (iML) is a burgeoning subdiscipline of computational statistics devoted to making the predictions of ML models more intelligible to end users. This article is a gentle and critical introduction to iML, with an emphasis on genomic applications. I define relevant concepts, motivate leading methodologies, and provide a simple typology of existing approaches. I survey recent examples of iML in genomics, demonstrating how such techniques are increasingly integrated into research workflows. I argue that iML solutions are required to realize the promise of precision medicine. However, several open challenges remain. I examine the limitations of current state of the art tools and propose a number of directions for future research. While the horizon for iML in genomics is wide and bright, continued progress requires close collaboration across disciplines.",

This study's principal research methodology is design science research, which is executed in three iterations: personas elicitation, a survey and development of student engagement factor models (SEFMs), and chatbot interaction analysis. This chapter focuses on the first iteration, personas elicitation, which proposes a data-driven persona development method (DDPDM) that utilises machine learning, precisely a k-means clustering technique. Data analysis is conducted using two datasets. Eight personas are produced from the two data analyses. The pragmatic findings from this study make two contributions to the current literature. Firstly, the proposed DDPDM uses machine learning, specifically k-means clustering, to build data-driven personas. Secondly, the persona template is designed for university students, which supports the construction of data-driven personas. Future work will cover the second and third iterations. ",

        "abstract": "In some real-world problems, machine learning is faced with little data due to limited resources such as sensors, time, and budget. In this case, the conventional machine learning approach may fail or perform badly. To develop a well-functioning model with a small training set the hybrid machine learning approach, the combination of different methods can be applied. Especially in the machine industry where Industry 4.0 is one of the most important topics—including condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated data analyses—data are limited and costly. In this work, the conventional and hybrid approach are compared to the application of ball bearing fault classification. The dataset contains 12 different classes (11 with faults and 1 undamaged). For each approach, two different LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are developed and trained on various training sets (different sensors). The hybrid model is realised by adding physical knowledge through applying fast Fourier transformation and frequency selection to the raw data. This study shows that the additional physical knowledge in the hybrid model results in a better performance of the hybrid machine learning than the conventional.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes has become a prevalent metabolic disease nowadays, affecting patients of all age groups and large populations around the world. Early detection would facilitate early treatment that helps the prognosis. In the literature of computational intelligence and medical care communities, different techniques have been proposed in predicting diabetes based on the historical records of related symptoms. The researchers share a common goal of improving the accuracy of a diabetes prediction model. In addition to the model induction algorithms, feature selection is a significant approach in retaining only the relevant attributes for the sake of building a quality prediction model later. In this article, a novel and simple feature selection criterion called Coefficient of Variation (CV) is proposed as a filter-based feature selection scheme. By following the CV method, attributes that have a data dispersion too low are disqualified from the model construction process. Thereby the attributes which are factors leading to poor model accuracy are discarded. The computation of CV is simple, hence enabling an efficient feature selection process. Computer simulation experiments by using the Prima Indian diabetes dataset is used to compare the performance of CV with other traditional feature selection methods. Superior results by CV are observed. ",

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms on both binary and multiple classification problems using a variety of performance metrics: accuracy, kappa statistic, precision, recall, specificity, F-measure, MAE, RMSE and MCC. Here, we found that RF algorithm proved to have the best performance in three out of seven datasets. But the other four algorithms: NN, NB, BB and LR also performed well.",

The available studies confirm the applicability of CKD as a promising alternative to OPC in cement mortar. This study will explore the effects of different percentages of CKD (10-30% of OPC amount) on the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) in the cement mortar's properties.

        "abstract": "Machine learning merupakan sistem yang mampu belajar sendiri untuk memutuskan sesuatu tanpa harus berulangkali diprogram oleh manusia sehingga komputer menjadi semakin cerdas berlajar dari pengalaman data yang dimiliki. Berdasarkan teknik pembelajarannya, dapat dibedakan supervised learning menggunakan dataset (data training) yang sudah berlabel, sedangkan unsupervised learning menarik kesimpulan berdasarkan dataset. Input berupa dataset digunakan pembelajaran mesin untuk menghasilkan analisis yang benar. Penyelesaian digunakan Python yang menyediakan algoritma dan library yang digunakan membuat machine learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) dan machine learning saat ini kembali memasuki fase booming setelah beberapa dekade mengalami pasang surut. Kecerdasan Buatan kembali digandrungi, dimana penerapannya dilakukan secara masive pada aplikasi-aplikasi bisnis dan social media jaman now seperti Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, dan bahkan berbagai aplikasi besar dari Indonesia seperti Go-jek, Tokopedia, dan sebagainya. Struktur pembahasan dalam buku ini meliputi 3 bagian besar yaitu (1) Konsep Machine Learning dan Kecerdasan Buatan (2) Dasar-Dasar Pemrograman Python untuk Machine Learning serta (3) Contoh Penerapan Machine Learning Menggunakan Python dengan menerapkan beberapa algoritma baik Supervised maupun Unsupervised Learning. Beberapa studi kasus dibahas secara lengkap dari pemahaman algoritma, mengolah dataset sampai pada training dan testing serta visualisasi hasil dari model machine learning yang dikembangkan.",

Deep learning holds many potential advantages when it comes to modelling highly non-linear data, as well as speed improvements when compared to traditional analysis and modelling techniques.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One such problem is the identification and de-trending of stellar and systematic instrument noise in exoplanet lightcurves and in particular time-resolved spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As part of the ESA Ariel Space mission and the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML-PKDD), we have organised two very successful machine learning challenges in 2019 and 2021 (https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space).&amp;#160; The aim was to provide new solutions to traditionally intractable problems and to foster closer collaboration between the exoplanet and machine learning communities. Often interdisciplinary approaches to long-standing problems are thwarted by jargon and a lack of familiarity. Data challenges are an excellent way to break down existing barriers and establish new links and collaborations.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The top-ranked approaches range from deep-learning to gradient boosted extreme learning machines. In this presentation, I will discuss their pros and cons of solving the set challenge and show how new ideas generated by the data challenges can achieve real progress in the field.&lt;/div&gt;",

The scheme is based on physically motivated models of electronic density and polarizability, resulting in a generic model without relying on an exhaustive training set. The scheme only requires in vacuo single point QM calculations to provide training densities and molecular dipolar polarizabilities. As an example, the scheme is applied to create an embedding model for the QM7 dataset using Gaussian Process Regression with only 445 reference atomic environments. The model was tested on SARS-CoV-2 protease complex with PF-00835231, resulting in predicted embedding energy RMSE of 2 kcal/mol, compared to explicit DFT/MM calculations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing allow biologists to observe cell function with unprecedented resolution, but the resulting datasets are too large and complicated for humans to understand without the aid of advanced statistical methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are designed to automatically find patterns in data, are well suited to this task. Yet these models are often so complex as to be opaque, leaving researchers with few clues about underlying mechanisms. Interpretable machine learning (iML) is a burgeoning subdiscipline of computational statistics devoted to making the predictions of ML models more intelligible to end users. This article is a gentle and critical introduction to iML, with an emphasis on genomic applications. I define relevant concepts, motivate leading methodologies, and provide a simple typology of existing approaches. I survey recent examples of iML in genomics, demonstrating how such techniques are increasingly integrated into research workflows. I argue that iML solutions are required to realize the promise of precision medicine. However, several open challenges remain. I examine the limitations of current state of the art tools and propose a number of directions for future research. While the horizon for iML in genomics is wide and bright, continued progress requires close collaboration across disciplines.",

This study's principal research methodology is design science research, which is executed in three iterations: personas elicitation, a survey and development of student engagement factor models (SEFMs), and chatbot interaction analysis. This chapter focuses on the first iteration, personas elicitation, which proposes a data-driven persona development method (DDPDM) that utilises machine learning, precisely a k-means clustering technique. Data analysis is conducted using two datasets. Eight personas are produced from the two data analyses. The pragmatic findings from this study make two contributions to the current literature. Firstly, the proposed DDPDM uses machine learning, specifically k-means clustering, to build data-driven personas. Secondly, the persona template is designed for university students, which supports the construction of data-driven personas. Future work will cover the second and third iterations. ",

        "abstract": "In some real-world problems, machine learning is faced with little data due to limited resources such as sensors, time, and budget. In this case, the conventional machine learning approach may fail or perform badly. To develop a well-functioning model with a small training set the hybrid machine learning approach, the combination of different methods can be applied. Especially in the machine industry where Industry 4.0 is one of the most important topics—including condition monitoring, predictive maintenance, and automated data analyses—data are limited and costly. In this work, the conventional and hybrid approach are compared to the application of ball bearing fault classification. The dataset contains 12 different classes (11 with faults and 1 undamaged). For each approach, two different LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are developed and trained on various training sets (different sensors). The hybrid model is realised by adding physical knowledge through applying fast Fourier transformation and frequency selection to the raw data. This study shows that the additional physical knowledge in the hybrid model results in a better performance of the hybrid machine learning than the conventional.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes has become a prevalent metabolic disease nowadays, affecting patients of all age groups and large populations around the world. Early detection would facilitate early treatment that helps the prognosis. In the literature of computational intelligence and medical care communities, different techniques have been proposed in predicting diabetes based on the historical records of related symptoms. The researchers share a common goal of improving the accuracy of a diabetes prediction model. In addition to the model induction algorithms, feature selection is a significant approach in retaining only the relevant attributes for the sake of building a quality prediction model later. In this article, a novel and simple feature selection criterion called Coefficient of Variation (CV) is proposed as a filter-based feature selection scheme. By following the CV method, attributes that have a data dispersion too low are disqualified from the model construction process. Thereby the attributes which are factors leading to poor model accuracy are discarded. The computation of CV is simple, hence enabling an efficient feature selection process. Computer simulation experiments by using the Prima Indian diabetes dataset is used to compare the performance of CV with other traditional feature selection methods. Superior results by CV are observed. ",

Different parameters such as Prandtl numbers, Hartmann numbers, Rayleigh numbers, and particle volume fractions are used to analyze nanofluid laminar flow behavior and temperature distribution. The fin has a significant impact on both the isotherm and the streamlines. Findings revealed that increasing the rotational angle of a spinning heat exchanger might result in more consistent temperature distribution along isotherms; larger fins, on the other hand, frequently provide greater heat dissipation due to increased surface area. Furthermore, when Rayleigh numbers increase, so does the temperature distribution between the fins and the surrounding fluid. The presence of a magnetic field affects fluid dynamics and contributes to the generation of entropy. Higher Prandtl numbers can result in the enhancement heat transfer phenomena and the generation of entropy.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer tissues grow when cells in the breast expand and divide uncontrollably, resulting in a lump of tissue commonly called and named tumor. Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among women, following skin cancer. While it is more commonly diagnosed in women aged 50 and above, it can affect individuals of any age. Although it is rare, men can also develop breast cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cases, with approximately 2,600 cases reported annually in the United States. Early detection of breast tumors is crucial in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. A publicly available dataset containing features of breast tumors was utilized to identify breast tumors using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Various prediction models were constructed, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light GBM, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. These models were trained to classify and predict breast tumor cases based on the provided features.",

These problems include students' struggle to self-regulate their learning, the increase in curriculum planning and administrative workload for teachers, and the loss of personalized interaction between students and teachers. This chapter explores how artificial intelligence can be used to help students and teachers to adapt to the new realities of online learning, and how these technologies could further transform higher education in the future. By providing more personalized, flexible, inclusive, and engaging learning experiences, artificial intelligence has the potential to re-invigorate students and teachers both and to make virtual classrooms more meaningful and productive.

        "abstract": "Machine learning is a form of knowledge production native to the era of big data. It is at the core of social media platforms and everyday interactions. It is also being rapidly adopted for research and discovery across academia, business and government. This paper will explore the way the affordances of machine learning itself, and the forms of social apparatus that it becomes a part of, will potentially erode ethics and draw us in to a drone-like perspective. Unconstrained machine learning enables and delimits our knowledge of the world in particular ways: the abstractions and operations of machine learning produce a ‘view from above’ whose consequences for both ethics and legality parallel the dilemmas of drone warfare. The family of machine learning methods is not somehow inherently bad or dangerous, nor does implementing them signal any intent to cause harm. Nevertheless, the machine learning assemblage produces a targeting gaze whose algorithms obfuscate the legality of its judgements, and whose iterations threaten to create both specific injustices and broader states of exception. Given the urgent need to provide some kind of balance before machine learning becomes embedded everywhere, this paper proposes people’s councils as a way to contest machinic judgements and reassert openness and discourse.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nFor advanced human-computer interaction, research on natural language processing is on trend, resulting in the development of innate and natural interaction modalities, such as chatbots. A chatbot is a software application that makes it possible to conduct conversations in a natural language for various user queries in an online mode, thus grabbing much attention in business and commercial applications. Various chatbot models have been reported previously, but no comprehensive chatbot model has been available for processing all human languages under all user applications. As a result, researchers have started to dedicate their efforts to develop their own chatbot model based on a specific language for some specific applications. With this specific goal, we have proposed a chatbot model for conservation in the English language that handles queries in the sociological domain based on a hybrid approach. The proposed chatbot model using generative and retrieval techniques, can handle one-word as well as descriptive responses to user sociological queries. We claim that the proposed chatbot can meet the needs of small-to medium-sized organizations for their research queries, and that this model is comparatively more interactive, easy to maintain, and cost-effective against the previous models.",

This study also concluded that online machine learning is useful for autonomous data structure modification. For the online machine learning algorithm, I have proposed a reinforcement machine learning algorithm that benefits from the reward system and optimize the knobs accordingly. Online learning, in my opinion, offers a trustworthy and efficient framework for assessing intricate dynamic tradeoffs.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImage classification, a pivotal task in multiple industries, faces computational challenges due to the burgeoning volume of visual data. This research addresses these challenges by introducing two quantum machine learning models that leverage the principles of quantum mechanics for effective computations. Our first model, a hybrid quantum neural network with parallel quantum circuits, enables the execution of computations even in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, where circuits with a large number of qubits are currently infeasible. This model demonstrated a record-breaking classification accuracy of 99.21% on the full MNIST dataset, surpassing the performance of known quantum–classical models, while having eight times fewer parameters than its classical counterpart. Also, the results of testing this hybrid model on a Medical MNIST (classification accuracy over 99%), and on CIFAR-10 (classification accuracy over 82%), can serve as evidence of the generalizability of the model and highlights the efficiency of quantum layers in distinguishing common features of input data. Our second model introduces a hybrid quantum neural network with a Quanvolutional layer, reducing image resolution via a convolution process. The model matches the performance of its classical counterpart, having four times fewer trainable parameters, and outperforms a classical model with equal weight parameters. These models represent advancements in quantum machine learning research and illuminate the path towards more accurate image classification systems.",

Trotz Fortschritten und Optimierungen bei der automatischen sensor-basierten Sortierung bleibt die Handsortierung von Abfällen relevant. Das Projekt recAIcle hat es sich zum Ziel gesetzt, die Digitalisierung der Handsortierung in der Abfallwirtschaft mithilfe von künstlicher Intelligenz (KI), Machine Learning (ML) und Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) voranzutreiben. KI und ML haben mehrfach gezeigt, wie sie ganze Industrien und Branchen revolutionieren können. Das Projekt RecAIcle fokussiert sich auf die Kunststoff- und Batterieerkennung und -sortierung. Die Produktivität und Qualität der Handsortierung sollen dadurch gesteigert werden. Hierfür wird ein digitales Assistenzsystem, das die Sortiermitarbeiter:innen bei der Sortierentscheidung unterstützt, entwickelt. Aufgrund der speziellen Anforderungen an ein solches System wurde das Framework Design entsprechend angepasst. Für die Entwicklung dieses Systems werden fortschrittliche, lebenslang lernende ML-Modelle benötigt, welche wiederum große Mengen an hochqualitativen Trainingsdaten und Rechenleistung benötigen. Um genügend use-case-spezifische Trainingsdaten bereitstellen zu können, wurden Versuche unter kontrollierten Bedingungen im Technikumsmaßstab zur Trainingsdatenakquise durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse des Systemdesignprozesses und der ersten Trainingsdatenakquise werden in dieser Veröffentlichung präsentiert. Ebenso wird ein Ausblick auf künftige Entwicklungen und weitere geplante Versuche gegeben.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;eo- and environmental sciences produce a wide variety and numerous data &lt;span&gt;which are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;extensively&lt;/span&gt; used both in fundamental research &lt;span&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; Earth processes and in important real-life decision-making. Most natural phenomena are non-linear, multivariate, highly variable and correlated at many spatio-temporal scales. Analysis and &lt;span&gt;treatment&lt;/span&gt; of such complex data and their integration/assimilation with science-based models is a &lt;span&gt;difficult&lt;/span&gt; problem. Contemporary machine learning (ML) proposes an important set of &lt;span&gt;effective &lt;/span&gt;approaches to address this problem &lt;span&gt;at all phases of the study&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, &lt;span&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;eosciences are one of the major customers of ML ideas and technologies. To a large degree, it is connected to the local and global challenges facing humanity: sustainable development, biodiversity, social and natural hazards and risks, meteo- and climate forecasting, &lt;span&gt;remote sensing &lt;/span&gt;Earth observation, &lt;span&gt;etc&lt;/span&gt;. Despite being theoretically a universal modelling tool, the success of ML applications significantly depends on the problem formulation, quantity and quality of data and objectives of the study. Therefore, an efficient application of ML demands a good knowledge of the phenomena under study and a profound understanding of learning algorithms which can be achieved in close collaboration between experts in the corresponding domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current presentation, &lt;span&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;he study of &lt;span&gt;geo- and &lt;/span&gt;environmental data using &lt;span&gt;different &lt;/span&gt;machine learning &lt;span&gt;algorithms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;reviewed&lt;/span&gt;. A problem-oriented approach, which follows a generic data-driven methodology, is &lt;span&gt;applied. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The methodology consists of several important steps, in particular,&lt;/span&gt; optimization &lt;span&gt;of monitoring&lt;/span&gt; and data collection, &lt;span&gt;comprehensive &lt;/span&gt;exploratory data analysis and &lt;span&gt;visualization, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;feature engineering and relevant variables selection, &lt;/span&gt; modelling with careful validation and testing, &lt;span&gt;explanation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;and communication &lt;/span&gt;of the results. &lt;span&gt;Advanced e&lt;/span&gt;xperimentation with data by &lt;span&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;different supervised and unsupervised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ML &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;algorithms&lt;/span&gt; helps in better understanding of &lt;span&gt;original &lt;/span&gt;data &lt;span&gt;and constructed input feature space&lt;/span&gt;, obtaining &lt;span&gt;more &lt;/span&gt;reliable and robust results and making intelligent decisions.

        "abstract": "The winding path of this research into fraud detection using traditional machine learning (ML) led us through landscapes of both impressive strides and thought-provoking hurdles. As we retrace our steps, revisiting key findings and peering into the technology's potential, a nuanced understanding of its effectiveness comes into focus. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating the surprising efficacy of traditional ML algorithms in combating fraudulent activities. By meticulously dissecting the Credit Card Fraud dataset and employing a rigorous methodological approach, we established that these algorithms can achieve commendable accuracy in identifying suspicious transactions. This not only reaffirms the viability of ML in fraud detection but also offers a valuable roadmap for future research and practical implementation. Our journey unveiled a fascinating tapestry of insights. We observed that different ML algorithms excel in specific domains. While Random Forest and Gradient Boosting proved to be overall champions, Logistic Regression [19] displayed exceptional talent in pinpointing certain types of fraudulent behavior. This underscores the importance of wielding a diverse arsenal of algorithms to achieve comprehensive fraud detection. Furthermore, we discovered that feature engineering is not merely a parlor trick, but a crucial stage in the dance with fraud. By crafting tailored features from the raw data, we were able to significantly enhance the accuracy of our models. This highlights the critical role of domain expertise in understanding the subtle nuances of fraudulent transactions and translating them into actionable features for ML algorithms. However, the ever-shifting sands of fraud necessitate constant vigilance and adaptation. Our research emphasizes the paramount importance of real-time monitoring and model updates to stay ahead of evolving fraudster tactics. This agility will be the key to unlocking the full potential of ML in this dynamic arena. Yet, our exploration would be remiss if it failed to acknowledge the limitations that linger within traditional ML. The \"black box\" nature of some algorithms can hinder interpretability and raise concerns about bias. Additionally, their reliance on historical data can render them vulnerable to novel fraud schemes that haven't yet graced the training dataset. However, these challenges should not overshadow the immense potential of traditional ML. Its ability to handle large datasets, learn from experience, and adapt to changing patterns remains invaluable in the fight against fraud. By combining traditional ML with other approaches, such as explainable AI and deep learning, we can unlock even greater capabilities and build robust, interpretable fraud detection systems that are not only effective, but also transparent and accountable. This research journey into traditional ML for fraud detection has illuminated both its strengths and weaknesses, paving the way for future advancements. By embracing its potential and addressing its limitations, we can leverage this powerful technology to create a safer and more secure digital landscape for everyone. The path forward lies in harnessing the diverse power of ML, while remaining mindful of its limitations, to build a future where fraudsters find themselves perpetually outwitted and outmaneuvered.",

The validation team qualifies the release based on multiple stages of validation on hardware and software stack. Bugs are raised after execution of test cases on each platform and so similar bugs arise which are filed by the user. There is a immediate concern on this and hence, many issues are closed as duplicates.The main objective is to find these similar bugs for each bug filed and thereby,debug efforts can be reused.Similar bugs are found by term based search using ElasticSearch ,a text search engine and neural network based search where context is considered.Using elasticsearch,scoring algorithms based on driver  versions and platform hierarchy are applied to rank the similar bugs. LSTM neural networks are also incorporated to predict duplicate bugs by considering context of the sentence and thereby, increasing accuracy.",

Hence, malware discovery is a significant component in the security of PC frameworks. These days, assailants by and large plan polymeric malware, it is typically a kind of malware that ceaselessly changes its unmistakable component to trick recognition strategies that utilizes run of the mill signature-based techniques. For that reason, the requirement for Machine Learning based identification emerges. In this work, we will acquire standard of conduct that might be accomplished through static or dynamic examination, a while later we can apply unique ML strategies to recognize regardless of whether it's malware. Conduct based Detection techniques will be talked about to take advantage from ML calculations in order to approach social-based malware acknowledgment, furthermore, grouping model. In this paper, study related between two major components. First one is machine learning algorithm apply on data set directly. Second is same Machine learning algorithm apply with Data science pre-processing steps.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is one of the fast-growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. There are several applications for machine learning. The most significant of which is supervised learning. Supervised learning is common in classification problems. In this study, frequently used twelve machine learning algorithms are considered: NB, LDA, LR, ANN, SVM, K-NN, HT, DT, C4.5, CART, RF and BB. We apply these algorithms on seven datasets. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms on both binary and multiple classification problems using a variety of performance metrics: accuracy, kappa statistic, precision, recall, specificity, F-measure, MAE, RMSE and MCC. Here, we found that RF algorithm proved to have the best performance in three out of seven datasets. But the other four algorithms: NN, NB, BB and LR also performed well.",

        "abstract": "The mixture of the traditional cement mortar is mainly made from three components; ordinary Portland cement (OPC), sand and water. However, the OPC has many proven adverse effects on the environment and economy, such as harmful emissions and depletion of natural sources. Therefore, some studies try to minimise the use of OPC in cement mortar by providing and testing some alternatives, such as Cement Kiln Dust (CKD). The available studies confirm the applicability of CKD as a promising alternative to OPC in cement mortar. This study will explore the effects of different percentages of CKD (10-30% of OPC amount) on the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) in the cement mortar's properties. This study showed that adding CKD as a partial replacement for OPC decreases the UPV compared to the reference sample.",

        "abstract": "&lt;div data-pm-slice=&quot;1 1 []&quot; data-en-clipboard=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The use of machine and deep learning is prevalent in many fields of science and industry and is now becoming more widespread in extrasolar planet and solar system sciences. Deep learning holds many potential advantages when it comes to modelling highly non-linear data, as well as speed improvements when compared to traditional analysis and modelling techniques.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;One such problem is the identification and de-trending of stellar and systematic instrument noise in exoplanet lightcurves and in particular time-resolved spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As part of the ESA Ariel Space mission and the European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML-PKDD), we have organised two very successful machine learning challenges in 2019 and 2021 (https://www.ariel-datachallenge.space).&amp;#160; The aim was to provide new solutions to traditionally intractable problems and to foster closer collaboration between the exoplanet and machine learning communities. Often interdisciplinary approaches to long-standing problems are thwarted by jargon and a lack of familiarity. Data challenges are an excellent way to break down existing barriers and establish new links and collaborations.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The top-ranked approaches range from deep-learning to gradient boosted extreme learning machines. In this presentation, I will discuss their pros and cons of solving the set challenge and show how new ideas generated by the data challenges can achieve real progress in the field.&lt;/div&gt;",

The scheme is based on physically motivated models of electronic density and polarizability, resulting in a generic model without relying on an exhaustive training set. The scheme only requires in vacuo single point QM calculations to provide training densities and molecular dipolar polarizabilities. As an example, the scheme is applied to create an embedding model for the QM7 dataset using Gaussian Process Regression with only 445 reference atomic environments. The model was tested on SARS-CoV-2 protease complex with PF-00835231, resulting in predicted embedding energy RMSE of 2 kcal/mol, compared to explicit DFT/MM calculations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing allow biologists to observe cell function with unprecedented resolution, but the resulting datasets are too large and complicated for humans to understand without the aid of advanced statistical methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, which are designed to automatically find patterns in data, are well suited to this task. Yet these models are often so complex as to be opaque, leaving researchers with few clues about underlying mechanisms. Interpretable machine learning (iML) is a burgeoning subdiscipline of computational statistics devoted to making the predictions of ML models more intelligible to end users. This article is a gentle and critical introduction to iML, with an emphasis on genomic applications. I define relevant concepts, motivate leading methodologies, and provide a simple typology of existing approaches. I survey recent examples of iML in genomics, demonstrating how such techniques are increasingly integrated into research workflows. I argue that iML solutions are required to realize the promise of precision medicine. However, several open challenges remain. I examine the limitations of current state of the art tools and propose a number of directions for future research. While the horizon for iML in genomics is wide and bright, continued progress requires close collaboration across disciplines.",

Language models, can help gain insight into a variety of interesting problems such as unsupervised learning rules of a game, detecting player behavior patterns, player attribution, and ultimately learning the game to beat state of the art. In this study, we applied BERT models, first to the simple Nim game to analyze its performance in the presence of noise in a setup of a few-shot learning architecture. We analyzed the model performance via three virtual players, namely Nim Guru, Random player, and Q-learner. In the second part, we applied the game learning language model to the chess game, and a large set of grandmaster games with exhaustive encyclopedia openings. Finally, we have shown that model practically learns the rules of the chess game and can survive games against Stockfish at a category-A rating level.",

        "abstract": "Not all errors from models predicting asset returns are equal in terms of impact on the efficiency of the algorithm: a small error could trigger poor investment decisions while a significant error has no financial consequences. This economic asymmetry, critical for assessing the performance of algorithms, can usefully be replicated within the machine learning algorithms itself through the loss function to improve its prediction capability. . In this article: (a) we analyze symmetric and asymmetric loss functions for deep learning algorithms. We develop custom loss functions that mimic the asymmetry in economic consequences of prediction errors. (b) We compare the efficiency of these custom loss functions with MSE and the linearexponential loss “LinEx”. (c) We present an efficient custom loss function that significantly improves the prediction of asset returns with improved risk-return metrics (like Sharpe ratio twice better), and which we confirm to be robust.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer tissues grow when cells in the breast expand and divide uncontrollably, resulting in a lump of tissue commonly called and named tumor. Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among women, following skin cancer. While it is more commonly diagnosed in women aged 50 and above, it can affect individuals of any age. Although it is rare, men can also develop breast cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cases, with approximately 2,600 cases reported annually in the United States. Early detection of breast tumors is crucial in reducing the risk of developing breast cancer. A publicly available dataset containing features of breast tumors was utilized to identify breast tumors using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Various prediction models were constructed, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light GBM, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. These models were trained to classify and predict breast tumor cases based on the provided features.",

These problems include students' struggle to self-regulate their learning, the increase in curriculum planning and administrative workload for teachers, and the loss of personalized interaction between students and teachers. This chapter explores how artificial intelligence can be used to help students and teachers to adapt to the new realities of online learning, and how these technologies could further transform higher education in the future. By providing more personalized, flexible, inclusive, and engaging learning experiences, artificial intelligence has the potential to re-invigorate students and teachers both and to make virtual classrooms more meaningful and productive.

The authors of the chapter developed a triangular scheme of machine learning, which included at each vertex one participant: a trainee, training, and an expert. To realize the goal set by the authors, an intelligent agent is included in the triangular scheme. The authors developed the innovation tools using intelligent visualization techniques for big data analytic with avatar-based management in sliding mode introduced by V. Mkrttchian in his books and chapters published by IGI Global in 2017-18. The developed algorithm, in contrast to the well-known, uses a three-loop feedback system that regulates the current state of the program depending on the user's actions, virtual state, and the status of implementation of available hardware resources. The algorithm of automatic situational selection of interactive software component configuration in virtual machine learning environment in intelligent-analytic platforms was developed. ",

        "abstract": "International trade is crucial to the U.S. economy. When measured by metric tonnage, 75% of the volume is transported by sea. This work explores the variables that impact trade volume, both on the individual and aggregate shipment level. Three supervised machine-learning techniques use data about U.S. maritime trade, U.S. unemployment, international tariff rates, and country exchange rates for the period of 2010 through 2019. The same variables are then used in combination with new information specific to COVID-19 for the period of 2019 and 2020. The tonnage of individual shipments remains unchanged before and after the prevalence of COVID-19. However, the frequency of shipments decreases during 2020, resulting in an aggregate decline of trade. Metrics that measure COVID-19's impact produce better model prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Digital platforms bring together organizations from different market segments. Consequently, digital business ecosystems orient themselves gradually according to the constraints imposed by different organizations although they are under the same segments. This phenomenon of influence also considerably enriches the data corpus. It has seldom been observed that the existing data features are always dynamic in nature. The context has become more challenging as many companies are often reluctant to share their information probably due to its confidentiality. Hence, with this paradigm of several variations, conventional matching to search a particular enterprise from the largest data corpus fails to deliver optimal matching prediction with respect to the different roles of the enterprises. This article presents an analytical and practical case study deploying a hybrid machine learning algorithm. The proposed methods depict the background of the digital business ecosystem, missing data imputation, and supervised machine learning approaches towards developing such models.",

Even with arrangement, it's frequent to find out restrictions of the design or improvements in the goal notion that necessitate improvements to working out information and parameters. But, by nowadays, there's number frequent knowledge by what these iterations contain, or what debugging resources are required to help the investigative process. As more information becomes accessible, more formidable issues may be tackled. Consequently, device understanding is commonly utilized in pc technology and different fields. But, establishing effective device understanding programs involves an amazing level of \"dark art\" that's difficult to find in textbooks. This short article summarizes a dozen critical classes that device understanding scientists and practitioners have learned. These calculations are useful for numerous applications like information mining, picture running, predictive analytics, etc. to call a few. The key benefit of applying device understanding is that, when an algorithm finds what direction to go with information, it may do their function automatically.",

        "abstract": "With the development of the Big Data, data analysis technology has been actively developed, and now it is used in various subject fields. More and more non-computer professional researchers use machine learning algorithms in their work. Unfortunately, datasets can be messy and knowledge cannot be directly extracted, which is why they need preprocessing. Because of the diversity of the algorithms, it is difficult for researchers to find the most suitable algorithm. Most of them choose algorithms through their intuition. The result is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, this article proposes a recommendation system for data processing. This system consists of an ontology subsystem and an estimation subsystem. Ontology technology is used to represent machine learning algorithm taxonomy, and information-theoretic based criteria are used to form recommendations. This system helps users to apply data processing algorithms without specific knowledge from the data science field. ",

This leads us to extend the security needs beyond the traditional approach which emerges the field of cyber security. Cyber security's core functionality is to protect all types of information, which includes hardware and software from cyber threats. The number of threats and attacks is increasing each year with a high difference between them. Machine learning and deep learning applications can be done to this attack, reducing the complexity to solve the problem and helping us to recover very easily. The algorithms used by both approaches are support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian algorithm, deep belief network (DBN), and deep random neural network (Deep RNN). These techniques provide better results than that of the traditional approach. The companies which use this approach in the real time scenarios are also covered in this chapter. ",

Moreover, the data is posted in such a random manner that can't be used directly for the analysis purpose; therefore, a considerable preprocessing is needed to use that data and generate important results that can help in decision making for various areas like sentiment analysis, customer feedback, customer reviews for brand and product, prevention management, risk management, etc. Therefore, this chapter is discussing various aspects of text and its structure, various machine learning algorithms and their types, why machine learning is better for text analysis, the process of text analysis with the help of examples, issues associated with text analysis, and major application areas of text analysis.

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep learning methods have become very popular for the processing of natural images and were then successfully adapted to the neuroimaging field. As these methods are non-transparent, interpretability methods are needed to validate them and ensure their reliability. Indeed, it has been shown that deep learning models may obtain high performance even when using irrelevant features, by exploiting biases in the training set. Such undesirable situations can potentially be detected by using interpretability methods. Recently, many methods have been proposed to interpret neural networks. However, this domain is not mature yet. Machine learning users face two major issues when aiming to interpret their models: which method to choose and how to assess its reliability. Here, we aim at providing answers to these questions by presenting the most common interpretability methods and metrics developed to assess their reliability, as well as their applications and benchmarks in the neuroimaging context. Note that this is not an exhaustive survey: we aimed to focus on the studies which we found to be the most representative and relevant.",

Besides the human losses, disasters cause significant and often catastrophic socioeconomic impacts, including economic losses. Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and especially in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been used to better cope with the severe and often catastrophic impacts of disasters. This paper aims to provide an overview of the research studies, presented since 2017, focusing on ML and DL developed methods for disaster management. In particular, focus has been given on studies in the areas of disaster and hazard prediction, risk and vulnerability assessment, disaster detection, early warning systems, disaster monitoring, damage assessment and post-disaster response as well as cases studies. Furthermore, some recently developed ML and DL applications for disaster management have been analyzed. A discussion of the findings is provided as well as directions for further research.",

The authors of the chapter developed a triangular scheme of machine learning, which included at each vertex one participant: a trainee, training, and an expert. To realize the goal set by the authors, an intelligent agent is included in the triangular scheme. The authors developed the innovation tools using intelligent visualization techniques for big data analytic with avatar-based management in sliding mode introduced by V. Mkrttchian in his books and chapters published by IGI Global in 2017-18. The developed algorithm, in contrast to the well-known, uses a three-loop feedback system that regulates the current state of the program depending on the user's actions, virtual state, and the status of implementation of available hardware resources. The algorithm of automatic situational selection of interactive software component configuration in virtual machine learning environment in intelligent-analytic platforms was developed. ",

        "abstract": "International trade is crucial to the U.S. economy. When measured by metric tonnage, 75% of the volume is transported by sea. This work explores the variables that impact trade volume, both on the individual and aggregate shipment level. Three supervised machine-learning techniques use data about U.S. maritime trade, U.S. unemployment, international tariff rates, and country exchange rates for the period of 2010 through 2019. The same variables are then used in combination with new information specific to COVID-19 for the period of 2019 and 2020. The tonnage of individual shipments remains unchanged before and after the prevalence of COVID-19. However, the frequency of shipments decreases during 2020, resulting in an aggregate decline of trade. Metrics that measure COVID-19's impact produce better model prediction accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Digital platforms bring together organizations from different market segments. Consequently, digital business ecosystems orient themselves gradually according to the constraints imposed by different organizations although they are under the same segments. This phenomenon of influence also considerably enriches the data corpus. It has seldom been observed that the existing data features are always dynamic in nature. The context has become more challenging as many companies are often reluctant to share their information probably due to its confidentiality. Hence, with this paradigm of several variations, conventional matching to search a particular enterprise from the largest data corpus fails to deliver optimal matching prediction with respect to the different roles of the enterprises. This article presents an analytical and practical case study deploying a hybrid machine learning algorithm. The proposed methods depict the background of the digital business ecosystem, missing data imputation, and supervised machine learning approaches towards developing such models.",

Even with arrangement, it's frequent to find out restrictions of the design or improvements in the goal notion that necessitate improvements to working out information and parameters. But, by nowadays, there's number frequent knowledge by what these iterations contain, or what debugging resources are required to help the investigative process. As more information becomes accessible, more formidable issues may be tackled. Consequently, device understanding is commonly utilized in pc technology and different fields. But, establishing effective device understanding programs involves an amazing level of \"dark art\" that's difficult to find in textbooks. This short article summarizes a dozen critical classes that device understanding scientists and practitioners have learned. These calculations are useful for numerous applications like information mining, picture running, predictive analytics, etc. to call a few. The key benefit of applying device understanding is that, when an algorithm finds what direction to go with information, it may do their function automatically.",

        "abstract": "Beta regression models are a class of supervised learning tools for regression problems with univariate and limited response. Current fitting procedures for beta regression require variable selection based on (potentially problematic) information criteria. We propose model selection criteria that take into account the leverage, residuals, and influence of the observations, both to systematic linear and nonlinear components. To that end, we propose a Predictive Residual Sum of Squares (PRESS)-like machine learning tool and a prediction coefficient, namely     P 2     statistic, as a computational procedure. Monte Carlo simulation results on the finite sample behavior of prediction-based model selection criteria     P 2     are provided. We also evaluated two versions of the     R 2     criterion. Finally, applications to real data are presented. The new criterion proved to be crucial to choose models taking into account the robustness of the maximum likelihood estimation procedure in the presence of influential cases.",

Machine learning algorithms used in this work include artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB). Deep learning technique is long short-term memory (LSTM). Linear regression, which is the statistical-based learning algorithm, is also applied to be the baseline of this comparative study. The modeling results reveal that among the statistical-based and machine learning-based techniques, GB and RF are the best two models to predict energy consumption, whereas ANN shows the predictive performance comparable to the linear regression model. Nevertheless, LSTM outperforms both statistical-based and machine learning-based algorithms in predicting industrial energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Understanding symmetry’s role in the physical sciences is critical for choosing an appropriate machine learning method. While invariant models are the most prevalent symmetry-aware models, equivariant models can more faithfully represent physical interactions. Until recently, equivariant models had been absent in the literature due to their technical complexity. Now, after two years of active development, fully-equivariant Euclidean neural net- works are ready to take on challenges across the physical sciences.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases have a negative impact on the agricultural sector. The diseases lower the productivity of the production yield and give huge losses to the farmers. For the betterment of agriculture, it is very essential to detect the diseases in the plants to protect the agricultural crop yield while it is also important to reduce the use of pesticides to improve the quality of the agricultural yield. Image processing and data mining algorithms together help analyze and detection of diseases. Using these techniques diseases detection can be done in rice leaves. In this research, the image processing technique is used to extract the feature from the leaf images. Further for the classification of diseases various machine learning algorithm like the random forest, J48 and support vector machine is used and the result is compared among different machine learning algorithm. After model evaluation, classification accuracy is verified using the n-fold cross-validation technique.",

The key idea in our work here is to achieve increased forecast capabilities by judiciously combining machine-learning algorithms and data assimilation. We combine the physics-agnostic data-driven approach of random feature maps as a forecast model within an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation procedure. The machine-learning model is learned sequentially by incorporating incoming noisy observations. We show that the obtained forecast model has remarkably good forecast skill while being computationally cheap once trained. Going beyond the task of forecasting, we show that our method can be used to generate reliable ensembles for probabilistic forecasting as well as to learn effective model closure in multi-scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;",

Jadi mereka beralih ke media sosial seperti Twitter untuk mendapatkan dukungan. Penderita depresi pengguna Twitter sulit untuk diidentifikasi berdasarkan tweet. Oleh karena itu pemodelan klasifikasi teks untuk penderita depresi sangat diperlukan agar mengetahui seberapa banyak pengguna twitter yang mengalami depresi dan kecemasan. Klasifikasi teks  merupakan metode untuk mengelompokkan data yang sejenis ke dalam kelompok yang sesuai. Algoritma yang digunakan dalam membuat pola penderita depresi adalah algoritma Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, dan K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Penggunaan keempat algoritma bertujuan untuk melihat kinerja algoritma terbaik. Hasil percobaan yang dilakukan diperoleh bahwa algoritma  Random Forest pada splitting data 80:20 memiliki kinerja yang lebih baik, dengan nilai akurasi sebesar 0.957 atau 96%. Hasil penelitian ini dapat digunakan oleh pengguna untuk mengetahui penderita depresi dan kecemasan.",

        "abstract": "Classification using machine learning is an alternative that is widely used to classify data. There are various classification methods or also known as machine learning classification algorithms that can be used. However, to get the best classification results, we need a classifier that fits the dataset type to provide the best classification performance. In addition, the quality and quantity of data contained in a dataset also has an influence on the classification performance. In this study, several attempts were made to improve the classification performance of the dataset of Indonesian language exam questions at the elementary school level based on the category of difficulty level. The efforts made consist of improving the quality of the dataset and using the StringToWordVector filter algorithm to manage textual data, as well as the use of several classification algorithms such as the nave Bayes algorithm, Random Forest, and REPTree.

        "abstract": "Optimum drilling penetration rate, known as the rate of penetration (ROP) has played  a big role in drilling operations. Planning the well   ROP   always becomes a challenge for drilling engineers to calculate the drilling time needed for the section. Optimum ROP is achieved when the time to drill the section is as planned.\r\nMany empirical approaches were develop to model the ROP based on the drilling parameters, and might not always match  the actual ROP. In some cases, the actual ROP was slower than planned, which may increase the drilling cost, which needs to be avoided.\r\nHence, some approaches using artificial intelligent (AI), and supervised machine learning  have been develop to overcome it. Supervised machine learning is used to develop a ROP model and ROP prediction for one of  the development fields,  based only on two wells drilling parameters data. The model was train using Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Drilling parameter test data then is used to validate the model. The model of Random Forest  shows a good or promising result with R2 of 0.90,   Gradient Boosting shows R2 of 0.86, and Support Vector Machine with R2 0.72. Based on the models generated, the Random Forest has shown good trend which could be used for modeling ROP in the future development wells.",

        "abstract": "With the development of the Big Data, data analysis technology has been actively developed, and now it is used in various subject fields. More and more non-computer professional researchers use machine learning algorithms in their work. Unfortunately, datasets can be messy and knowledge cannot be directly extracted, which is why they need preprocessing. Because of the diversity of the algorithms, it is difficult for researchers to find the most suitable algorithm. Most of them choose algorithms through their intuition. The result is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, this article proposes a recommendation system for data processing. This system consists of an ontology subsystem and an estimation subsystem. Ontology technology is used to represent machine learning algorithm taxonomy, and information-theoretic based criteria are used to form recommendations. This system helps users to apply data processing algorithms without specific knowledge from the data science field. ",

Services of cloud computing is based on sharing; thus, it is open for attacker to attack on its security. The main thing that grabs the organizations to adapt the cloud computing technology is cost reduction through optimized and efficient computing, but there are various vulnerabilities and threats in cloud computing that affect its security. Providing security in such a system is a major concern as it uses public network to transmit data to a remote server. Therefore, the biggest problem of cloud computing system is its security. The objective of the chapter is to review Machine learning methods that are applied to handle zero-day attacks in a cloud environment. ",

This leads us to extend the security needs beyond the traditional approach which emerges the field of cyber security. Cyber security's core functionality is to protect all types of information, which includes hardware and software from cyber threats. The number of threats and attacks is increasing each year with a high difference between them. Machine learning and deep learning applications can be done to this attack, reducing the complexity to solve the problem and helping us to recover very easily. The algorithms used by both approaches are support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian algorithm, deep belief network (DBN), and deep random neural network (Deep RNN). These techniques provide better results than that of the traditional approach. The companies which use this approach in the real time scenarios are also covered in this chapter. ",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of regressional mathematics and algebraic topology comes advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Such advancements when looking into problems such as nuclear fusion and entropy, can be utilized to analyze unsolved abnormalities in the area of fusion related research. Proof theory will be utilized throughout this paper. For logical mathematical proofs: n represents an unknown number, e represents point of entropy, and m represents maximum point, f represents fusion. This paper will look into analysis of the topic of nuclear fusion and unsolved problems as hardness problems and attempt to formulate computational proofs in relation to entropy, fusion maximum, heat transfer, and entropy transfer mechanisms. This paper will not only be centered around logical proofs but also around computational mechanisms such as distributed computing and its potential role in analyzing computational hardness in relation to fusion related problems. We will summarize a proposal for experimentation utilizing further logical proof formalities and the decentralized-internet SDK for a computational pipeline in order to solve fusion related hardness problems.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease has become one of the alarming issues of death. It is accountable for fatty plaques in the arteries. If this fatal condition can be identified early, we can preserve many people’s arteries. Different types of supervised machine learning algorithms are applied in our research paper in order to predict heart disease existence in patient body. Besides this, we have focused on an efficient way to improve the performance of our applied classifiers. Imputing mean value technique is applied to handle null values present in our dataset. The features which are unnecessary are removed by using the info-gain feature selection technique. In order to calculate prediction accuracy, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes and Random Forest are applied to the heart disease dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC are calculated which help us to compare the performance of the classification models. Handling null values on a particular column by imputing mean values of that column and our applied info-gain feature selection technique has aided us in improving the accuracy of our prediction models. Random Forest among all has given the best classification accuracy which is 95.63% with precision, recall, F1-score and ROC are 0.93, 0.92, 0.92 and 0.9, respectively.",

This work converts the binary headers of 40,000 firmware examples from bytes into 1024-pixel thumbnail images to train a deep neural network. The aim is to distinguish benign and malicious variants using modern deep learning methods without needing detailed functional or forensic analysis tools. One outcome of this image conversion enables contact with the vast machine learning literature already applied to handle digit recognition (MNIST). Another result indicates that greater than 90% accurate classifications prove possible using image-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) when combined with transfer learning methods. The envisioned CNN application would intercept firmware updates before their distribution to IoT networks and score their likelihood of containing malicious variants.",

These techniques have been pivotal in the success of variousapplications, from image recognition to natural language processing. In this article, we will delve into thefundamentals of transfer learning and pre-trained models, exploring their significance and impact in theworld of artificial intelligence. The Essence of Transfer LearningAt its core, transfer learning is a machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from onetask to improve the performance of another related task. Think of it as the process of transferringknowledge from a source domain to a target domain. In traditional machine learning, models are trainedfrom scratch for each specific task. Transfer learning, on the other hand, takes a different approach—itcapitalizes on the idea that what a model learns from one task can be beneficially applied to a differentbut related task",

        "abstract": "Computer vision is a research field in computer science that provides the computer the ability of human perceptions. The goal of computer vision is to understand the image and its contents. Computer vision has evolved from simple pattern recognition to solving various complex real-world problems. Nowadays, computer vision has its application to the various domains of scientific areas not limited to Computer Science. It is widely used for medical science, biology, physics, and chemistry as well. The recent boost in computer vision is the due influence of machine learning (ML). ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is a method that makes a computer learn from the provided data and improve its performance with time. Computer vision problems are complex, and they require a correct choice of algorithms. In this chapter, some machine learning algorithms that are widely used in computer vision will be discussed. The theoretical concepts are related to real-world computer vision problems such as human skin detection. ",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of regressional mathematics and algebraic topology comes advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Such advancements when looking into problems such as nuclear fusion and entropy, can be utilized to analyze unsolved abnormalities in the area of fusion related research. Proof theory will be utilized throughout this paper. For logical mathematical proofs: n represents an unknown number, e represents point of entropy, and m represents maximum point, f represents fusion. This paper will look into analysis of the topic of nuclear fusion and unsolved problems as hardness problems and attempt to formulate computational proofs in relation to entropy, fusion maximum, heat transfer, and entropy transfer mechanisms. This paper will not only be centered around logical proofs but also around computational mechanisms such as distributed computing and its potential role in analyzing computational hardness in relation to fusion related problems. We will summarize a proposal for experimentation utilizing further logical proof formalities and the decentralized-internet SDK for a computational pipeline in order to solve fusion related hardness problems.",

Banyak permasalahan nyata dalam kehidupan sehari-hari dapat diselesaiksan dengan metode pembelajaran, meliputi: prediksi, klasifikasi, rekomendasi, ataupun pengelompokan suatu obyek benda atau kasus tertentu. Buku Ajar Machine Learning ini dimulai dari konsep dasar metode pembelajaran mesin, representasi data, dan pemrosesan awal data. Kemudian dilanjutkan dengan pendekatan secara statistik dalam metode pembelajaran, metode supervised learning, unsupervised learning (clustering), Semi-supervised learning (Reinforcement Learning), serta pengembangan metode pembelajaran mesin (ensemble machine learning). Terakhir, disajikan metode evaluasi pengukuran tingkat performansi kualitas model. Buku ajar ini dilengkapi berbagai contoh soal sehingga mahasiswa dapat mudah memahami dengan belajar secara mandiri dan interaktif. Harapan dari penulis, pembaca bisa memahami dan menganalisis secara tepat dalam pemecahan permasalahan berbasis machine learning serta mengimplementasikan dalam berbagai bidang dalam kehidupan sehari-hari.",

While invariant models are the most prevalent symmetry-aware models, equivariant models can more faithfully represent physical interactions.

Now, after two years of active development, fully-equivariant Euclidean neural net- works are ready to take on challenges across the physical sciences.",

        "abstract": "In this chapter, machine learning application on facial expression recognition (FER) is studied for seven emotional states (disgust, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, contempt, and fear) based on FER describing coefficient. FER has many practical importance in various area like social network, robotics, healthcare, etc. Further, a literature review of existing machine learning approaches for FER is discussed, and a novel approach for FER is given for static and dynamic images. Then the results are compared with the other existing approaches. The chapter also covers additional related issues of applications, various challenges, and opportunities in future FER. For security-based face detection systems that can identify an individual, in any form of expression he introduces himself. Doctors will use this system to find the intensity of illness or pain of a deaf and dumb patient. The proposed model is based on machine learning application with three types of prototypes, which are pre-trained model, single layer augmented model, and multi-layered augmented model, having a combined accuracy of approx. 99%.

        "abstract": "<p>Although deep learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like vulnerability detection and classification, they have drawbacks. A significant disadvantage of deep learning methods is their inexplicability. Many deep learning models, especially sequential models like long short-term memories and gated recurrent units, operate as black-boxes. The outputs of these black-box models are uninterpretable by security analysts and software developers. This inexplicability of deep learning models hinders their acceptance in enterprises. It also prevents the knowledgeable system experts from removing the spurious correlations that the model might have learned. Thus, it is highly desirable to have explainable deep learning models to promote their acceptance in real-world systems. Another major drawback of deep learning is adversarial machine learning. Cyber attackers can utilize adversarial machine learning to fool the deep learning-based cyber-attack detectors. Prior research has shown that cyber-defenders can use explainable artificial intelligence to defend against adversarial machine learning attacks. Therefore, adding explainability to deep learning models for cyber-security is highly desirable. This article proposes a method that enhances the explainability of system-call sequence analysis-based vulnerability detection. Our method can potentially pinpoint the precise instruction calls that have triggered the vulnerability. This insight is valuable for the security analyst as he can now evaluate the sequence of system calls more efficiently.</p>",

        "abstract": "An approach based on machine-learning is presented that is able to identify chemical bond types such as single, double, triple and aromatic bonds based on spatial atomic coordinates only, as provided for example from quantum chemical calculations or from crystallographic data. The basic idea behind this work is to exploit the various chemical knowledge already assembled in molecular data files in form of connection tables and bond blocks. Rules for novel chemistry or particular functional groups can be learned automatically by training on structure data (.sd/.sdf) files with the respective bond information. Provided that the underlying database is sufficiently large and diverse, the approach is able to identify chemical bond orders in molecules with an accuracy comparable to classical bond-perception tools using hard-coded rules and cheminformatic algorithms. The workflow is implemented in Python using the open source packages RDKit, scikit-learn and pandas (https://github.com/CHLoschen/mamba).",

Machine learning algorithms used in this work include artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB). Deep learning technique is long short-term memory (LSTM). Linear regression, which is the statistical-based learning algorithm, is also applied to be the baseline of this comparative study. The modeling results reveal that among the statistical-based and machine learning-based techniques, GB and RF are the best two models to predict energy consumption, whereas ANN shows the predictive performance comparable to the linear regression model. Nevertheless, LSTM outperforms both statistical-based and machine learning-based algorithms in predicting industrial energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Ball velocity of pitching is an important factor in baseball players. Commonly, ball velocity measurement requires specific devices such as radar gun. On the other hand, Gomaz et al. developed the accurate ball velocity measurement using two inertial sensors on pelvis and trunk. Recently, smartphone installed inertial sensor is popular device in daily life. Therefore, if ball velocity can be measured by only a single inertial sensor, baseball players can measure own ball velocity by only smartphone in daily life and various situations. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose and evaluate the ball velocity prediction method using the only a single inertial sensor. The proposed method predicts ball velocity using by a single inertial sensor and machine learning technique. Five machine learning algorithms (linear regression, support vector machine, gaussian process, artificial neural network, and M5P) predicted ball velocity by data of single inertial sensor, body height, and body weight. In this study,  Gomaz et al.’s public data for ball velocity and inertial data during pitching of baseball players were used for this investigation.  Sensor placement was either sternum or pelvis. Accuracy of prediction was evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE) between actual and predicted value via leave-one-out cross-validation. The results showed that greatest algorithm (M5P) could accurately predict ball velocity by only single inertial sensor and body parameters (RMSE < 2.0 mph). These results suggest that ball velocity can be measured by only single inertial sensor such as smartphone.",

These reviews may be either in the form of a word, sentence, document, or ratings. These reviews are used as datasets when applied to train a classifier. These datasets are applied in the annotated form with the positive, negative or neutral labels as an input to train the classifier. This trained classifier is used to test other reviews, either in the same or different domains to know like or dislike of the user for the related field. Various researches have been done in single and cross domain sentiment analysis. The new methods proposed are overcoming the previous ones but according to this survey, no methods best suit the proposed work. In this article, the authors review the methods and techniques that are given by various researchers in cross domain sentiment analysis and how those are compared with the pre-existing methods for the related work.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate simulations of atomistic systems from first principles are limited by computational cost. In high-throughput settings, machine learning can reduce these costs significantly by accurately interpolating between reference calculations. For this, kernel learning approaches crucially require a representation that accommodates arbitrary atomistic systems. We introduce a many-body tensor representation that is invariant to translations, rotations, and nuclear permutations of same elements, unique, differentiable, can represent molecules and crystals, and is fast to compute. Empirical evidence for competitive energy and force prediction errors is presented for changes in molecular structure, crystal chemistry, and molecular dynamics using kernel regression and symmetric gradient-domain machine learning as models. Applicability is demonstrated for phase diagrams of Pt-group/transition-metal binary systems.",

In this study we use simple machine learning approaches to develop a novel real-time ramp metering algorithm.

Furthermore, the chapter argues that the use of ML methods may be facilitating a cultural and infrastructural alignment between big tech and financial services through both the adoption of open source software within finance and the dependence of ML on large-scale cloud infrastructures. Accordingly, the chapter identifies two potential directions for future work on the sociology of financial machine learning: a “horizontal” expansion to account for the ways machine learning is being used across financial institutions, and a “vertical” deepening that investigates the infrastructures upon which ML systems are developed and deployed, and how they are shaping financial institutions and markets.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe notion of uncertainty is of major importance in machine learning and constitutes a key element of machine learning methodology. In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.",

FER has many practical importance in various area like social network, robotics, healthcare, etc. Further, a literature review of existing machine learning approaches for FER is discussed, and a novel approach for FER is given for static and dynamic images. Then the results are compared with the other existing approaches. The chapter also covers additional related issues of applications, various challenges, and opportunities in future FER. For security-based face detection systems that can identify an individual, in any form of expression he introduces himself. Doctors will use this system to find the intensity of illness or pain of a deaf and dumb patient. The proposed model is based on machine learning application with three types of prototypes, which are pre-trained model, single layer augmented model, and multi-layered augmented model, having a combined accuracy of approx. 99%.

        "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative approach to glaucoma detection through the application of deep learning, with a primary focus on the MobileNetV2 architecture. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, demands early detection for effective management. Deep learning models hold substantial promise in this context, despite historical concerns regarding their opacity. This research systematically explores the effectiveness of deep learning in glaucoma diagnosis while prioritizing techniques that enhance transparency and interpretability. By leveraging a meticulously curated dataset, this study showcases the remarkable potential of the MobileNetV2 model, achieving a test accuracy of approximately 67.7%. Furthermore, it contributes valuable insights into image processing, the adept utilization of neural networks, and lays a solid foundation for the advancement of automated glaucoma detection. This research exemplifies the synergy of cutting-edge technology and a commitment to transparency, setting the stage for more effective glaucoma diagnostics and improved patient care.\n",

        "abstract": "<p>Although deep learning achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like vulnerability detection and classification, they have drawbacks. A significant disadvantage of deep learning methods is their inexplicability. Many deep learning models, especially sequential models like long short-term memories and gated recurrent units, operate as black-boxes. The outputs of these black-box models are uninterpretable by security analysts and software developers. This inexplicability of deep learning models hinders their acceptance in enterprises. It also prevents the knowledgeable system experts from removing the spurious correlations that the model might have learned. Thus, it is highly desirable to have explainable deep learning models to promote their acceptance in real-world systems. Another major drawback of deep learning is adversarial machine learning. Cyber attackers can utilize adversarial machine learning to fool the deep learning-based cyber-attack detectors. Prior research has shown that cyber-defenders can use explainable artificial intelligence to defend against adversarial machine learning attacks. Therefore, adding explainability to deep learning models for cyber-security is highly desirable. This article proposes a method that enhances the explainability of system-call sequence analysis-based vulnerability detection. Our method can potentially pinpoint the precise instruction calls that have triggered the vulnerability. This insight is valuable for the security analyst as he can now evaluate the sequence of system calls more efficiently.</p>",

        "abstract": "An approach based on machine-learning is presented that is able to identify chemical bond types such as single, double, triple and aromatic bonds based on spatial atomic coordinates only, as provided for example from quantum chemical calculations or from crystallographic data. The basic idea behind this work is to exploit the various chemical knowledge already assembled in molecular data files in form of connection tables and bond blocks. Rules for novel chemistry or particular functional groups can be learned automatically by training on structure data (.sd/.sdf) files with the respective bond information. Provided that the underlying database is sufficiently large and diverse, the approach is able to identify chemical bond orders in molecules with an accuracy comparable to classical bond-perception tools using hard-coded rules and cheminformatic algorithms. The workflow is implemented in Python using the open source packages RDKit, scikit-learn and pandas (https://github.com/CHLoschen/mamba).",

        "abstract": "This article describes how coffee rust has become a serious concern for many coffee farmers and manufacturers. The American Phytopathological Society discusses its importance saying this: “…the most economically important coffee disease in the world…” while “…in monetary value, coffee is the most important agricultural product in international trade…” The early detection has inspired researchers to apply supervised learning algorithms on predicting the disease appearance. However, the main issue of the related works is the small number of samples of the dependent variable: Incidence Percentage of Rust, since the datasets do not have a reliable representation of the disease, which will generate inaccurate predictions in the models. This article provides a process about coffee rust to select appropriate machine learning methods to increase rust samples. ",

        "abstract": "The exponential advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robotics, and automation are rapidly transforming industries and societies across the world. The way we work, the way we live, and the way we interact with others are expected to be transformed at a speed and scale beyond anything we have observed in human history. This new industrial revolution is expected, on one hand, to enhance and improve our lives and societies. On the other hand, it has the potential to cause major upheavals in our way of life and our societal norms. The window of opportunity to understand the impact of these technologies and to preempt their negative effects is closing rapidly. Humanity needs to be proactive, rather than reactive, in managing this new industrial revolution. This article looks at the promises, challenges, and future research directions of these transformative technologies. Not only are the technological aspects investigated, but behavioral, societal, policy, and governance issues are reviewed as well. This research contributes to the ongoing discussions and debates about AI, automation, machine learning, and robotics. It is hoped that this article will heighten awareness of the importance of understanding these disruptive technologies as a basis for formulating policies and regulations that can maximize the benefits of these advancements for humanity and, at the same time, curtail potential dangers and negative impacts.

        "abstract": "Static authentication methods, like passwords, grow increasingly weak with advancements in technology and attack strategies. Continuous authentication has been proposed as a solution, in which users who have gained access to an account are still monitored in order to continuously verify that the user is not an imposter who had access to the user credentials. Mouse dynamics is the behavior of a user’s mouse movements and is a biometric that has shown great promise for continuous authentication schemes. This article builds upon our previous published work by evaluating our dataset of 40 users using three machine learning and three deep learning algorithms. Two evaluation scenarios are considered: binary classifiers are used for user authentication, with the top performer being a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with a peak average test accuracy of 85.73% across the top-10 users. Multi-class classification is also examined using an artificial neural network (ANN) which reaches an astounding peak accuracy of 92.48%, the highest accuracy we have seen for any classifier on this dataset.",

        "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems have many important application domains, including social networks, manufacturing, and transportation. However, as an NP-hard problem, the traditional CO problem-solvers require domain knowledge and hand-crafted heuristics. Facing big data challenges, can we solve these challenging problems with a learning structure within a short time? This article will demonstrate how to solve the combinatorial optimization problems with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that learns the optimal policy over time. Building on Markov decision process, RL has the solid theoretical foundation to obtain the optimal solution. Once parameters of DRL are trained, a new problem case can be solved quickly. Moreover, DRL learns the optimal solution without labels by maximizing the accumulative discounted reward received from the environment. This article will discuss three typical CO problems and present the advantages of DRL over other traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a\nlong time. While supporters of the <i>efficient market hypothesis</i> believe\nthat it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions\ndemonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may\nlead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be\nvery accurately predicted. Researchers have also worked on technical analysis\nof stocks with a goal of identifying patterns in the stock price movements\nusing advanced data mining techniques. In this work, we propose an approach of\nhybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning\nand deep learning-based models. For the purpose of our study, we have used NIFTY\n50 index values of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, during the period\nDecember 29, 2014 till July 31, 2020.  We\nhave built eight regression models using the training data that consisted of\nNIFTY 50 index records from December 29, 2014 till December 28, 2018. Using\nthese regression models, we predicted the <i>open</i> values of NIFTY 50 for\nthe period December 31, 2018 till July 31, 2020. We, then, augment the\npredictive power of our forecasting framework by building four deep\nlearning-based regression models using long-and short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks with a novel approach of walk-forward validation. Using the grid-searching\ntechnique, the hyperparameters of the LSTM models are optimized so that it is\nensured that validation losses stabilize with the increasing number of epochs,\nand the convergence of the validation accuracy is achieved. We exploit the\npower of LSTM regression models in forecasting the future NIFTY 50 <i>open</i>\nvalues using four different models that differ in their architecture and in the\nstructure of their input data. Extensive results are presented on various\nmetrics for all the regression models. The results clearly indicate that the\nLSTM-based univariate model that uses one-week prior data as input for\npredicting the next week's <i>open</i> value of the NIFTY 50 time series is the\nmost accurate model.",

        "abstract": "Music genre classification is the fundamental step involved in building a strong recommendation system. If music classification has to be carried out manually, then one has to listen to numerous songs and then select the genre. This process is not only time-consuming, it is quite a tedious task. The music industry has seen an excellent flow of latest channels to browse and distribute music. This doesn't return without drawbacks. With the increase in data, manual curation has become a difficult task. Audio files have a plethora of features that could be used to make parts of this process a lot easier. Advancements in technology have made it possible to extract the features of audio files. However, the most effective way to handle these for various tasks is unknown. This paper compared the two deep learning models of convolutional neural networks namely Alex-net and Res-net for the purpose of music genre classification using mel-spectrogram images for training. These aforementioned models were tested on GTZAN datasets. It was found that the results showed 56.0% accuracy for the res-net model which was outperformed by alex-net with an accuracy of 80.5%.

        "abstract": "Large medical datasets are available in various data repositories and are used to identify diseases. Parkinson's disease is regarded as one of the most lethal and progressive nervous system diseases affecting movement. It is the second most common cause of disability in the brain and it Reduces life expectancy and has no cure. Nearly 90% of affected people with this disease have speech disorders. In real-world applications, data is generated using a variety of Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning algorithms assist in the generation of useful content from it. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect diseases in their early stages in order to extend the lives of the elderly. When considering the term 'Parkinson's,' the main concept is speech features. In this paper, we are reviewing various Machine Learning techniques such as KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Deep learning techniques and Logistic Regression to predict Parkinson's disease based on user input, and the input for algorithms is the dataset. Based on these characteristics, we anticipate that the algorithms will be more accurate. The model is used in conjunction with the frontend to predict whether or not the patient has Parkinson's disease. Prediction is critical in the early stages of patient recovery. This can be accomplished with the assistance of Machine Learning  Keyword : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN), Machine Learning, Parkinson’s, Speech disorders, Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM).",

This issue can lead to inappropriate behavior using social media, which is referred to as cyberbullying. Automated systems are capable of efficiently identifying cyberbullying and performing sentiment analysis on social media platforms. This study focuses on enhancing a system to detect six types of cyberbullying tweets. Employing multi-classification algorithms on a cyberbullying dataset, our approach achieved high accuracy, particularly with the TF-IDF (bigram) feature extraction. Our experiment achieved high performance compared with that stated for previous experiments on the same dataset. Two ensemble machine learning methods, employing the N-gram with TF-IDF feature-extraction technique, demonstrated superior performance in classification. Three popular multi-classification algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were combined into two varied ensemble methods separately. These ensemble classifiers demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning classifier models. The stacking classifier reached 90.71% accuracy and the voting classifier 90.44%. The results of the experiments showed that the framework can detect six different types of cyberbullying more efficiently, with an accuracy rate of 0.9071.",

        "abstract": "A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning workflow related to mental health data.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen active efforts within the geophysical community to combine traditional Data Assimilation (DA) methods with emerging Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, most of this past theoretical work has been centered on variational DA approaches due to their similarity with ML in terms of how the underlying optimization problem is formulated and solved. Here I will present a new and completely general nonlinear estimation theory that retains the flexibility of advanced sampling-based methods (e.g., the particle filter) and the analytical tractability of linear estimation algorithms (e.g., the ensemble Kalman filter). In particular, an alternative state space model will be constructed whose filtering and smoothing distributions remain closed under a wide class of nonlinear functions. Since these nonlinear functions are only required to be bijective and continuously differentiable, the new estimation theory serves an ideal framework for rigorously incorporating invertible neural networks in the DA design. There are two additional properties which make the proposed framework especially appealing. First, linear estimation results follow immediately upon substituting the invertible neural networks with the identity transformation. Second, the prior and posterior belong to the same distribution family, which implies that the correlation structure and the corresponding dynamical balances in the model state are preserved following the analysis step. During the upcoming EGU meeting, I will discuss the motivation behind the new estimation framework, place it in the context of existing nonlinear DA techniques and demonstrate some of its benefits through idealized numerical examples.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Any events that have already been detected manually or algorithmically can be used to train the classifier to perform a similar classification of other data without the user having to define parameters. In this study, we investigate the use of random machine learning techniques in the forest to detect fixations, jerks and post-saccadic oscillations (PSOs). To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method for applications involving eye movement classification algorithms, we present an example of the method in an eye-movement-driven biometric application. We conclude that machine learning techniques lead to better recognition performance than current state-of-the-art event recognition algorithms and can match the performance of manual coding.",

        "abstract": "Large medical datasets are available in various data repositories and are used to identify diseases. Parkinson's disease is regarded as one of the most lethal and progressive nervous system diseases affecting movement. It is the second most common cause of disability in the brain and it Reduces life expectancy and has no cure. Nearly 90% of affected people with this disease have speech disorders. In real-world applications, data is generated using a variety of Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning algorithms assist in the generation of useful content from it. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect diseases in their early stages in order to extend the lives of the elderly. When considering the term 'Parkinson's,' the main concept is speech features. In this paper, we are reviewing various Machine Learning techniques such as KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Deep learning techniques and Logistic Regression to predict Parkinson's disease based on user input, and the input for algorithms is the dataset. Based on these characteristics, we anticipate that the algorithms will be more accurate. The model is used in conjunction with the frontend to predict whether or not the patient has Parkinson's disease. Prediction is critical in the early stages of patient recovery. This can be accomplished with the assistance of Machine Learning  Keyword : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN), Machine Learning, Parkinson’s, Speech disorders, Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM).",

        "abstract": "The impact of communication through social media is currently considered a significant social issue. This issue can lead to inappropriate behavior using social media, which is referred to as cyberbullying. Automated systems are capable of efficiently identifying cyberbullying and performing sentiment analysis on social media platforms. This study focuses on enhancing a system to detect six types of cyberbullying tweets. Employing multi-classification algorithms on a cyberbullying dataset, our approach achieved high accuracy, particularly with the TF-IDF (bigram) feature extraction. Our experiment achieved high performance compared with that stated for previous experiments on the same dataset. Two ensemble machine learning methods, employing the N-gram with TF-IDF feature-extraction technique, demonstrated superior performance in classification. Three popular multi-classification algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were combined into two varied ensemble methods separately. These ensemble classifiers demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning classifier models. The stacking classifier reached 90.71% accuracy and the voting classifier 90.44%. The results of the experiments showed that the framework can detect six different types of cyberbullying more efficiently, with an accuracy rate of 0.9071.",

        "abstract": "A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning workflow related to mental health data.",

Unlike other software that can be installed through the package manager, developing machine learning systems usually need to search for the source code or start from scratch, debug and then deploy to production. It usually costs much for small companies and research institutions to run, test, evaluate, deploy and monitor machine learning system. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning package manager aiming to assist users1) find potentially useful models,2) resolve dependencies,3) deploy as HTTP service. By using the MLPM, users are enabled to easily adopt existing and well-established machine learning algorithms and libraries to their project within few steps. MLPM also allows third-party extensions to be installed, which makes the system customizable according to users’ workflow.rpose",

Most research in the field has used the very outdated dataset (KDDCup99) which\nconsists of a set handcrafted features. In our research we present models that work well on both\nthe older dataset and on newer datasets such as ISCX2014 and ISCX2012. We also present\nmethods for extracting features from these datasets. Another issue we found with most research in\nthis field is that they do not study the effect of surges in regular network traffic and how that might\naffect the model. We put our model to test in 10x traffic and show its effectiveness under these\nconditions. We also study how semi-supervised models can be used in training NIDS models\nwithout directly showing them labeled data.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and efficient nonlinear dynamical systems models are essential to understand, predict, estimate, and control complex natural and engineered systems.  In this talk, I will explore how machine learning may be used to develop these models purely from measurement data.  We explore the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy, avoiding overfitting.  This approach tends to promote models that are interpretable and generalizable, capturing the essential “physics” of the system.  We also discuss the importance of learning effective coordinate systems in which the dynamics may be expected to be sparse.  This sparse modeling approach will be demonstrated on a range of challenging modeling problems, for example in fluid dynamics.  Because fluid dynamics is central to aerospace systems, we will emphasize the importance of machine learning solutions that are interpretable, explainable, generalizable, and that respect known physics.",

Machine learning (an artificial intelligence subset) is being used in a variety of health-related fields, including the invention of new medical treatments, the management of patient data and records, and the treatment of chronic diseases. One of the most important uses of machine learning in healthcare is the detection and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that are otherwise difficult to identify. This can range from tumors that are difficult to detect in their early stages to other hereditary illnesses. This research identifies and discusses the various usages of machine learning in medical diagnosis.",

The American Phytopathological Society discusses its importance saying this: “…the most economically important coffee disease in the world…” while “…in monetary value, coffee is the most important agricultural product in international trade…” The early detection has inspired researchers to apply supervised learning algorithms on predicting the disease appearance. However, the main issue of the related works is the small number of samples of the dependent variable: Incidence Percentage of Rust, since the datasets do not have a reliable representation of the disease, which will generate inaccurate predictions in the models. This article provides a process about coffee rust to select appropriate machine learning methods to increase rust samples. ",

        "abstract": "The exponential advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robotics, and automation are rapidly transforming industries and societies across the world. The way we work, the way we live, and the way we interact with others are expected to be transformed at a speed and scale beyond anything we have observed in human history. This new industrial revolution is expected, on one hand, to enhance and improve our lives and societies. On the other hand, it has the potential to cause major upheavals in our way of life and our societal norms. The window of opportunity to understand the impact of these technologies and to preempt their negative effects is closing rapidly. Humanity needs to be proactive, rather than reactive, in managing this new industrial revolution. This article looks at the promises, challenges, and future research directions of these transformative technologies. Not only are the technological aspects investigated, but behavioral, societal, policy, and governance issues are reviewed as well. This research contributes to the ongoing discussions and debates about AI, automation, machine learning, and robotics. It is hoped that this article will heighten awareness of the importance of understanding these disruptive technologies as a basis for formulating policies and regulations that can maximize the benefits of these advancements for humanity and, at the same time, curtail potential dangers and negative impacts.

This is required to improve the growth of several organizations or in applications like e-healthcare, etc. Also, we are entering into an era of smart world, where robotics is going to take place in most of the applications (to solve the world's problems). Implementing robotics in applications like medical, automobile, etc. is an aim/goal of computer vision. Computer vision (CV) is fulfilled by several components like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Here, machine learning and deep learning techniques/algorithms are used to analyze Big Data. Today's various organizations like Google, Facebook, etc. are using ML techniques to search particular data or recommend any post. Hence, the requirement of a computer vision is fulfilled through these three terms: AI, ML, and DL. ",

        "abstract": "Static authentication methods, like passwords, grow increasingly weak with advancements in technology and attack strategies. Continuous authentication has been proposed as a solution, in which users who have gained access to an account are still monitored in order to continuously verify that the user is not an imposter who had access to the user credentials. Mouse dynamics is the behavior of a user’s mouse movements and is a biometric that has shown great promise for continuous authentication schemes. This article builds upon our previous published work by evaluating our dataset of 40 users using three machine learning and three deep learning algorithms. Two evaluation scenarios are considered: binary classifiers are used for user authentication, with the top performer being a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with a peak average test accuracy of 85.73% across the top-10 users. Multi-class classification is also examined using an artificial neural network (ANN) which reaches an astounding peak accuracy of 92.48%, the highest accuracy we have seen for any classifier on this dataset.",

Unlike other software that can be installed through the package manager, developing machine learning systems usually need to search for the source code or start from scratch, debug and then deploy to production. It usually costs much for small companies and research institutions to run, test, evaluate, deploy and monitor machine learning system. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning package manager aiming to assist users1) find potentially useful models,2) resolve dependencies,3) deploy as HTTP service. By using the MLPM, users are enabled to easily adopt existing and well-established machine learning algorithms and libraries to their project within few steps. MLPM also allows third-party extensions to be installed, which makes the system customizable according to users’ workflow.rpose",

        "abstract": "In this research we have studied the use of machine learning techniques in detecting network\nintrusions. Most research in the field has used the very outdated dataset (KDDCup99) which\nconsists of a set handcrafted features. In our research we present models that work well on both\nthe older dataset and on newer datasets such as ISCX2014 and ISCX2012. We also present\nmethods for extracting features from these datasets. Another issue we found with most research in\nthis field is that they do not study the effect of surges in regular network traffic and how that might\naffect the model. We put our model to test in 10x traffic and show its effectiveness under these\nconditions. We also study how semi-supervised models can be used in training NIDS models\nwithout directly showing them labeled data.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and efficient nonlinear dynamical systems models are essential to understand, predict, estimate, and control complex natural and engineered systems.  In this talk, I will explore how machine learning may be used to develop these models purely from measurement data.  We explore the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy, avoiding overfitting.  This approach tends to promote models that are interpretable and generalizable, capturing the essential “physics” of the system.  We also discuss the importance of learning effective coordinate systems in which the dynamics may be expected to be sparse.  This sparse modeling approach will be demonstrated on a range of challenging modeling problems, for example in fluid dynamics.  Because fluid dynamics is central to aerospace systems, we will emphasize the importance of machine learning solutions that are interpretable, explainable, generalizable, and that respect known physics.",

Machine learning (an artificial intelligence subset) is being used in a variety of health-related fields, including the invention of new medical treatments, the management of patient data and records, and the treatment of chronic diseases. One of the most important uses of machine learning in healthcare is the detection and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that are otherwise difficult to identify. This can range from tumors that are difficult to detect in their early stages to other hereditary illnesses. This research identifies and discusses the various usages of machine learning in medical diagnosis.",

The American Phytopathological Society discusses its importance saying this: “…the most economically important coffee disease in the world…” while “…in monetary value, coffee is the most important agricultural product in international trade…” The early detection has inspired researchers to apply supervised learning algorithms on predicting the disease appearance. However, the main issue of the related works is the small number of samples of the dependent variable: Incidence Percentage of Rust, since the datasets do not have a reliable representation of the disease, which will generate inaccurate predictions in the models. This article provides a process about coffee rust to select appropriate machine learning methods to increase rust samples. ",

        "abstract": "The exponential advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robotics, and automation are rapidly transforming industries and societies across the world. The way we work, the way we live, and the way we interact with others are expected to be transformed at a speed and scale beyond anything we have observed in human history. This new industrial revolution is expected, on one hand, to enhance and improve our lives and societies. On the other hand, it has the potential to cause major upheavals in our way of life and our societal norms. The window of opportunity to understand the impact of these technologies and to preempt their negative effects is closing rapidly. Humanity needs to be proactive, rather than reactive, in managing this new industrial revolution. This article looks at the promises, challenges, and future research directions of these transformative technologies. Not only are the technological aspects investigated, but behavioral, societal, policy, and governance issues are reviewed as well. This research contributes to the ongoing discussions and debates about AI, automation, machine learning, and robotics. It is hoped that this article will heighten awareness of the importance of understanding these disruptive technologies as a basis for formulating policies and regulations that can maximize the benefits of these advancements for humanity and, at the same time, curtail potential dangers and negative impacts.

This is required to improve the growth of several organizations or in applications like e-healthcare, etc. Also, we are entering into an era of smart world, where robotics is going to take place in most of the applications (to solve the world's problems). Implementing robotics in applications like medical, automobile, etc. is an aim/goal of computer vision. Computer vision (CV) is fulfilled by several components like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Here, machine learning and deep learning techniques/algorithms are used to analyze Big Data. Today's various organizations like Google, Facebook, etc. are using ML techniques to search particular data or recommend any post. Hence, the requirement of a computer vision is fulfilled through these three terms: AI, ML, and DL. ",

        "abstract": "Static authentication methods, like passwords, grow increasingly weak with advancements in technology and attack strategies. Continuous authentication has been proposed as a solution, in which users who have gained access to an account are still monitored in order to continuously verify that the user is not an imposter who had access to the user credentials. Mouse dynamics is the behavior of a user’s mouse movements and is a biometric that has shown great promise for continuous authentication schemes. This article builds upon our previous published work by evaluating our dataset of 40 users using three machine learning and three deep learning algorithms. Two evaluation scenarios are considered: binary classifiers are used for user authentication, with the top performer being a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) with a peak average test accuracy of 85.73% across the top-10 users. Multi-class classification is also examined using an artificial neural network (ANN) which reaches an astounding peak accuracy of 92.48%, the highest accuracy we have seen for any classifier on this dataset.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Recent years have seen active efforts within the geophysical community to combine traditional Data Assimilation (DA) methods with emerging Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, most of this past theoretical work has been centered on variational DA approaches due to their similarity with ML in terms of how the underlying optimization problem is formulated and solved. Here I will present a new and completely general nonlinear estimation theory that retains the flexibility of advanced sampling-based methods (e.g., the particle filter) and the analytical tractability of linear estimation algorithms (e.g., the ensemble Kalman filter). In particular, an alternative state space model will be constructed whose filtering and smoothing distributions remain closed under a wide class of nonlinear functions. Since these nonlinear functions are only required to be bijective and continuously differentiable, the new estimation theory serves an ideal framework for rigorously incorporating invertible neural networks in the DA design. There are two additional properties which make the proposed framework especially appealing. First, linear estimation results follow immediately upon substituting the invertible neural networks with the identity transformation. Second, the prior and posterior belong to the same distribution family, which implies that the correlation structure and the corresponding dynamical balances in the model state are preserved following the analysis step. During the upcoming EGU meeting, I will discuss the motivation behind the new estimation framework, place it in the context of existing nonlinear DA techniques and demonstrate some of its benefits through idealized numerical examples.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Any events that have already been detected manually or algorithmically can be used to train the classifier to perform a similar classification of other data without the user having to define parameters. In this study, we investigate the use of random machine learning techniques in the forest to detect fixations, jerks and post-saccadic oscillations (PSOs). To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method for applications involving eye movement classification algorithms, we present an example of the method in an eye-movement-driven biometric application. We conclude that machine learning techniques lead to better recognition performance than current state-of-the-art event recognition algorithms and can match the performance of manual coding.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPsychiatric disorders include a broad panel of heterogeneous conditions. Among the most severe psychiatric diseases, in intensity and incidence, depression will affect 15–20% of the population in their lifetime, schizophrenia 0.7–1%, and bipolar disorder 1–2.5%. Today, the diagnosis is solely based on clinical evaluation, causing major issues since it is subjective and as different diseases can present similar symptoms. These limitations in diagnosis lead to limitations in the classification of psychiatric diseases and treatments. There is therefore a great need for new biomarkers, usable at an individual level. Among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to measure potential brain abnormalities in patients with psychiatric disorders. This creates datasets with high dimensionality and very subtle variations between healthy subjects and patients, making machine and statistical learning ideal tools to extract biomarkers from these data. Machine learning brings different tools that could be useful to tackle these issues. On the one hand, supervised learning can support automated classification between different psychiatric conditions. On the other hand, unsupervised learning could allow the identification of new homogeneous subgroups of patients, refining our understanding of the classification of these disorders. In this chapter, we will review current research applying machine learning tools to brain imaging in psychiatry, and we will discuss its interest, limitations, and future applications.",

        "abstract": "Bike-ride sharing systems are the new generation of traditional bike rentals, where the entire process is automated. A user rents a bike from one location and returns it at another location. There are more than 500 bike-ride sharing systems around the world, consisting of more than 500,000 bikes. Bike-ride sharing systems are typically found in urban and large cities such as Boston, N.Y. City, Washington DC, Paris, Montreal, and Barcelona. Bike-ride sharing is particularly important due to their important impact on traffic, environment, and health. As popular as bike-ride sharing systems are, there is a lack of a reliable model to forecast (predict) bike rental demand daily. Lack of available bikes constitutes an inconvenience to individuals seeking a bike at a certain location and a loss of revenues for companies operating the bikes. This paper develops a Machine Learning (ML) model (algorithm) to forecast (predict) the number of bikes rented daily based on historical data. Moreover, the model overlays environmental and seasonal settings to study their impact on bike rental demand. We test our ML model using a real-life dataset obtained from a local bike-ride sharing company in the City of Boston in the state of Massachusetts in the United States. We also applied the model to historical dataset from New York City (NYC). In both cases, the model is accurate and reliable.\n ",

        "abstract": "As the circumstances are changing, mankind has turned out to be more inclined to snappy and speedier correspondence and access to information. The correspondence happens in numerous structures (e.g., presently, this correspondence is all the more a virtual substance than a physical one). So as to keep up fast correspondence, the coming age will depend on exceptionally tried and true, canny and self-learning/self-modifying correspondence organizers. In this context, this chapter reviews the most important machine learning techniques with the direct applicability in wireless ad-hoc systems. A guide of machine learning methods and their relevance is also provided. Different applications of ad-hoc wireless networks are discussed in terms of energy-aware communications, optimal node deployment and localization, resource allocation, and scheduling. ",

        "abstract": "In this work, we address a multi-class classification task of oyster vessel behaviors determination by classifying them into four different classes: fishing, traveling, poling (exploring) and docked (anchored). The main purpose of this work is to automate the oyster vessel behaviors determination task using machine learning and to explore different techniques to improve the accuracy of the oyster vessel behavior prediction problem. To employ machine learning technique, two important descriptors: speed and net speed, are calculated from the trajectory data, recorded by a satellite communication system (Vessel Management System, VMS) attached to the vessels fishing on the public oyster grounds of Louisiana. We constructed a support vector machine (SVM) based method which employs Radial Basis Function (RBF) as a kernel to accurately predict the behavior of oyster vessels. Several validation and parameter optimization techniques were used to improve the accuracy of the SVM classifier. A total 93% of the trajectory data from a July 2013 to August 2014 dataset consisting of 612,700 samples for which the ground truth can be obtained using rule-based classifier is used for validation and independent testing of our method. The results show that the proposed SVM based method is able to correctly classify 99.99% of 612,700 samples using the 10-fold cross validation. Furthermore, we achieved a precision of 1.00, recall of 1.00, F1-score of 1.00 and a test accuracy of 99.99%, while performing an independent test using a subset of 93% of the dataset, which consists of 31,418 points.",

        "abstract": "The inevitable result that gas wells witness during their life production is the liquid loading problem. The liquids that come with gas block the production tubing if the gas velocity supplied by the reservoir pressure is not enough to carry them to surface. Researchers used different theories to solve the problem naming, droplet fallback theory, liquid film reversal theory, characteristic velocity, transient simulations, and others. While there is no definitive answer on what theory is the most valid or the one that performs the best in all cases. This paper comes to involve a different approach, a combination between physics-based modeling and statistical analysis of what is known as Machine Learning (ML). The authors used a refined ML algorithm named XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) to develop a novel full procedure on how to diagnose the well with liquid loading issues and predict the critical gas velocity at which it starts to load if not loaded already. The novel procedure includes a combination of a classification problem where a well will be evaluated based on some completion and fluid properties (diameter, liquid density, gas density, liquid viscosity, gas viscosity, angle of inclination from horizontal (alpha), superficial liquid velocity, and the interfacial tension) as a “Liquid Loaded” or “Unloaded”. The second practice is to determine the critical gas velocity, and this is done by a regression method using the same inputs. Since the procedure is a data-driven approach, a considerable amount of data (247 well and lab measurements) collected from literatures has been used. Convenient ML technics have been applied from dividing the data to scaling, modeling and assessment. The results showed that a wellconstructed XGBoost model with an optimized hyperparameters is efficient in diagnosing the wells with the correct status and in predicting the onset of liquid loading by estimating the critical gas velocity. The assessment of the model was done relatively to existing correlations in literature. In the classification problem, the model showed a better performance with an F-1 score of 0.947 (correctly classified 46 cases from 50 used for testing). In contrast, the next best model was the one by Barnea with an F-1 score of 0.81 (correctly classified 37 from 50 cases). In the regression problem, the model showed an R2  of 0.959. In contrast, the second best model was the one by Shekhar with an R2  of 0.84. The results shown here prove that the model and the procedure developed give better results in diagnosing the well correctly if properly used by engineers.",

        "abstract": "Recommender systems that utilize machine learning algorithms are a prominent tool in the design and implementation of personalized tourism experiences. These systems analyze user data to generate recommendations for destinations, attractions, accommodations, and activities based on user preferences, behavior, and similarity to other users. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering are two widely used machine learning algorithms in recommender systems, and hybrid systems that combine both approaches have shown to be effective in producing more accurate recommendations. Tourism recommendation systems (TRS) provide several benefits, including personalization, convenience, improved user experience, and increased revenue for tourism businesses. These systems can suggest destinations, attractions, accommodations, and activities that match user preferences and past behaviors, ultimately simplifying the trip planning process. Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets to generate personalized recommendations, and can continuously improve their effectiveness by incorporating new data and user feedback. This paper provides a state-of-the-art overview of various types of recommendation systems (RS), including those based on user preferences, behaviors, demographic profiles, and social network judgments. The paper also presents a comparison table for these approaches. Additionally, the paper discusses the different stages of the travel process and the sources of data that can be used to develop a recommender system. The concluding section of the paper highlights the importance of personalized recommendations in the tourism industry and the potential for future research in this area.",

Interpersonal interaction administrations are utilized by a great many people from one side of the planet to the other. The cooperations that people have with web-based media destinations, for example, Twitter and Facebook significantly affect their everyday lives, for certain terrible repercussions now and again, also. For instance, Facebook has developed to get quite possibly the most lavishly utilized foundation ever, empowering an unsuitably immense measure of spam to be sent out of the site. Client accounts made by counterfeit clients send spontaneous tweets to different clients to advance organizations or sites, which influence genuine clients as well as motivation asset utilization to ascend too. The chance of spreading off base data to clients by means of the utilization of phony personalities has additionally expanded, possibly prompting the appropriation of unsafe things. Thus, thediscovery of spammers and the ID of phony Twitter clients have as of late emerged as an unmistakable examination subject in the space of contemporary online interpersonal organizations (OSNs). All through this article,we will take a gander at the methods that are presently being used to distinguish spammers on the web-based media stage Twitter. Besides,a scientific categorization of Twitter spam location strategies is introduced, what Separates the strategies into four classifications dependent on their capacity to distinguish I counterfeit material, (ii) spamdependent on URL,(iii) spam in hot subjects,and (iv) fake clients on the person to person communication site. Just as a scope of models like client qualities, content attributes, diagram properties and different components, the provided procedures are additionally evaluated and thought about. There are three kinds of attributes: singular attributes, underlying qualities,and transient characteristics.Eventually, we accept that the exploration we've given will be an important asset for researchers looking for the features of ongoing progressions in Facebook spam identification in a one area.",

While sentiment analysis has many applications in English, the Arabic language is still recognizing its early steps in this field. In this paper, we show an application on Arabic sentiment analysis by implementing a sentiment classification for Arabic tweets. The retrieved tweets are analyzed to provide their sentiments polarity (positive, or negative). Since, this data is collected from the social network Twitter; it has its importance for the Middle East region, which mostly speaks Arabic our research was characterized by relying mainly on the XGBoost algorithm, which is considered the most powerful algorithm in the world of big data analysis. The results were compared with several other algorithms that were used to show us the clear difference in terms of accuracy and F1 score between these algorithms and the XGBoost algorithm, The hyperparameters are obtained from the grid search algorithm to get the best performance for each model used in our work.\nThe results showed that our use of the XGBoost model gave more accurate results compared to the previous best-performing models in this field. A website has been created so that the user enters the comment to show him the result (positive comment or negative comment).",

In this work, we use a sequence-to-sequence model, specifically, a transformer, to compute a key element of the cross section calculation, namely, the squared amplitude of an interaction. We show that a transformer model is able to predict correctly 97.6% and 99% of squared amplitudes of quantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics processes, respectively, at a speed that is up to orders of magnitude faster than current symbolic computation frameworks. We discuss the performance of the current model, its limitations and possible future directions for this work.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSingle-shot readout is a key component for scalable quantum information processing. However, many solid-state qubits with favorable properties lack the single-shot readout capability. One solution is to use the repetitive quantum-non-demolition readout technique, where the qubit is correlated with an ancilla, which is subsequently read out. The readout fidelity is therefore limited by the back-action on the qubit from the measurement. Traditionally, a threshold method is taken, where only the total photon count is used to discriminate qubit state, discarding all the information of the back-action hidden in the time trace of repetitive readout measurement. Here we show by using machine learning (ML), one obtains higher readout fidelity by taking advantage of the time trace data. ML is able to identify when back-action happened, and correctly read out the original state. Since the information is already recorded (but usually discarded), this improvement in fidelity does not consume additional experimental time, and could be directly applied to preparation-by-measurement and quantum metrology applications involving repetitive readout.",

If music classification has to be carried out manually, then one has to listen to numerous songs and then select the genre. This process is not only time-consuming, it is quite a tedious task. The music industry has seen an excellent flow of latest channels to browse and distribute music. This doesn't return without drawbacks. With the increase in data, manual curation has become a difficult task. Audio files have a plethora of features that could be used to make parts of this process a lot easier. Advancements in technology have made it possible to extract the features of audio files. However, the most effective way to handle these for various tasks is unknown. This paper compared the two deep learning models of convolutional neural networks namely Alex-net and Res-net for the purpose of music genre classification using mel-spectrogram images for training. These aforementioned models were tested on GTZAN datasets. It was found that the results showed 56.0% accuracy for the res-net model which was outperformed by alex-net with an accuracy of 80.5%.

        "abstract": "Brain tumors are prevalent and aggressive disease, with a relatively short life expectancy in their most severe form. Thus, treatment planning is an important element in improving patient quality of life. In general, image techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound imaging are used to examine tumors in the brain, lung, liver, and breast. MRI scans are used in this study to diagnose brain tumors. As a result, a reliable and automated classification technique is required to prevent death. Automatic brain tumor detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) classification is proposed in this chapter. Small kernels are used to conduct the deeper architectural design. In machine learning, brain tumor classification is done by using a binary classifier to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. In this chapter, transfer learning is used to build the classifier, achieving a good accuracy and visualizing the model's overall performance. ",

MEPE uses the predictive uncertainty of a Gaussian process (GP) to balance exploration and exploitation when selecting the next training sample. However, the predictive uncertainty of a GP is unlikely to be accurate or precise immediately after training. We hypothesize that calibrating the uncertainty quantification within MEPE will improve active learning performance. We develop and test two methods to improve uncertainty estimates: post-hoc calibration of predictive uncertainty using the CRUDE algorithm, and replacing the GP with a student-t process. We investigate the impact of these methods on MEPE for single sample and batch sample active learning. Our findings suggest that post-hoc calibration does not improve the performance of active learning using the MEPE method. However, we do find that the student-t process can outperform active learning strategies and random sampling using a GP if the training set is sufficiently large.",

Parkinson's disease is regarded as one of the most lethal and progressive nervous system diseases affecting movement. It is the second most common cause of disability in the brain and it Reduces life expectancy and has no cure. Nearly 90% of affected people with this disease have speech disorders. In real-world applications, data is generated using a variety of Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning algorithms assist in the generation of useful content from it. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect diseases in their early stages in order to extend the lives of the elderly. When considering the term 'Parkinson's,' the main concept is speech features. In this paper, we are reviewing various Machine Learning techniques such as KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Deep learning techniques and Logistic Regression to predict Parkinson's disease based on user input, and the input for algorithms is the dataset. Based on these characteristics, we anticipate that the algorithms will be more accurate. The model is used in conjunction with the frontend to predict whether or not the patient has Parkinson's disease. Prediction is critical in the early stages of patient recovery. This can be accomplished with the assistance of Machine Learning  Keyword : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm (KNN), Machine Learning, Parkinson’s, Speech disorders, Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM).",

Employing multi-classification algorithms on a cyberbullying dataset, our approach achieved high accuracy, particularly with the TF-IDF (bigram) feature extraction. Our experiment achieved high performance compared with that stated for previous experiments on the same dataset. Two ensemble machine learning methods, employing the N-gram with TF-IDF feature-extraction technique, demonstrated superior performance in classification. Three popular multi-classification algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were combined into two varied ensemble methods separately. These ensemble classifiers demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning classifier models. The stacking classifier reached 90.71% accuracy and the voting classifier 90.44%. The results of the experiments showed that the framework can detect six different types of cyberbullying more efficiently, with an accuracy rate of 0.9071.",

        "abstract": "A common privacy issue in traditional machine learning is that data needs to be disclosed for the training procedures. In situations with highly sensitive data such as healthcare records, accessing this information is challenging and often prohibited. Luckily, privacy-preserving technologies have been developed to overcome this hurdle by distributing the computation of the training and ensuring the data privacy to their owners. The distribution of the computation to multiple participating entities introduces new privacy complications and risks. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving decentralised workflow that facilitates trusted federated learning among participants. Our proof-of-concept defines a trust framework instantiated using decentralised identity technologies being developed under Hyperledger projects Aries/Indy/Ursa. Only entities in possession of Verifiable Credentials issued from the appropriate authorities are able to establish secure, authenticated communication channels authorised to participate in a federated learning workflow related to mental health data.",

Unlike other software that can be installed through the package manager, developing machine learning systems usually need to search for the source code or start from scratch, debug and then deploy to production. It usually costs much for small companies and research institutions to run, test, evaluate, deploy and monitor machine learning system. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning package manager aiming to assist users1) find potentially useful models,2) resolve dependencies,3) deploy as HTTP service. By using the MLPM, users are enabled to easily adopt existing and well-established machine learning algorithms and libraries to their project within few steps. MLPM also allows third-party extensions to be installed, which makes the system customizable according to users’ workflow.rpose",

In this talk, I will explore how machine learning may be used to develop these models purely from measurement data.  We explore the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, which identifies a minimal dynamical system model that balances model complexity with accuracy, avoiding overfitting.  This approach tends to promote models that are interpretable and generalizable, capturing the essential “physics” of the system.  We also discuss the importance of learning effective coordinate systems in which the dynamics may be expected to be sparse.  This sparse modeling approach will be demonstrated on a range of challenging modeling problems, for example in fluid dynamics.  Because fluid dynamics is central to aerospace systems, we will emphasize the importance of machine learning solutions that are interpretable, explainable, generalizable, and that respect known physics.",

        "abstract": "We describe five specific guiding principles for applications of machine learning (ML) to problems in chemistry and material sciences, using data from both experiments and simulations. The principles are the following: 1. Use ML for interpolation but with care for extrapolation; 2. Ensure consistency between sources of data and the targeted application; 3. Correlation is not causation; 4. Optimize information extraction when using ML; 5. Combine different methods, including experiments, theory, and computing to provide a larger window of applications. These principles were developed based on the applications that the authors have been actively involved in, in both industrial and academic settings. Each of these guiding principles is illustrated, using examples from biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, or material science. Examples include Mendeleev's periodic table, estimation of interface adhesion in semiconductor materials, measurements in chemical analysis for cancer chemistry, singularities in evolutionary biology, and the development of faster quantum chemistry methods. The use of specific examples, in turn, will help illustrate the basic premise behind each of the principles. We believe that these unique perspectives highlight potential fallacies in applying these techniques broadly to all problems in natural sciences and engineering, without appropriate bounding of accuracy and precision, especially in areas related to the chemical and materials sciences.",

While sentiment analysis has many applications in English, the Arabic language is still recognizing its early steps in this field. In this paper, we show an application on Arabic sentiment analysis by implementing a sentiment classification for Arabic tweets. The retrieved tweets are analyzed to provide their sentiments polarity (positive, or negative). Since, this data is collected from the social network Twitter; it has its importance for the Middle East region, which mostly speaks Arabic our research was characterized by relying mainly on the XGBoost algorithm, which is considered the most powerful algorithm in the world of big data analysis. The results were compared with several other algorithms that were used to show us the clear difference in terms of accuracy and F1 score between these algorithms and the XGBoost algorithm, The hyperparameters are obtained from the grid search algorithm to get the best performance for each model used in our work.\nThe results showed that our use of the XGBoost model gave more accurate results compared to the previous best-performing models in this field. A website has been created so that the user enters the comment to show him the result (positive comment or negative comment).",

A Both of these ingredients are processed to accompany the people's staple food in the form of sauce and seasoning. In supermarkets, these vegetables can be found easily, but many people do not understand how to choose the type and quality of chilies and tomatoes. This study discusses the classification of types of cayenne, curly, green, red chilies, and tomatoes with good and bad conditions using machine learning and contrast enhancement techniques. The machine learning methods used are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest (RF). The results of testing the best method are measured based on the value of accuracy. In addition to the accuracy of this study, it also measures the speed of computation so that the methods used are efficient.",

Its analysis generates the opportunity to develop processes to study and solve social problems that affect the people's lives, merging technology and real data. One of the problems in urban areas is the traffic. Every day at big cities people lose time, money, and life quality when they get stuck in traffic jams; another urban problem derived from traffic is air pollution. In the present approach, a traffic event classification methodology is implemented to analyze VGI and internet information related to traffic events with a view to identify the main traffic problems in a city and to visualize the congested roads. The methodology uses different computing tools and algorithms to achieve the goal. To obtain the data, a social media and RSS channels are consulted. The extracted data texts are classified into seven possible traffic events, and geolocalized. In the classification, a machine learning algorithm is applied. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nExcited states of molecules lie in the heart of photochemistry and chemical reactions. The recent development in quantum computational chemistry leads to inventions of a variety of algorithms that calculate the excited states of molecules on near-term quantum computers, but they require more computational burdens than the algorithms for calculating the ground states. In this study, we propose a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts the excited-state properties of molecules only from their ground state wavefunction resulting in reducing the computational cost for calculating the excited states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical machine learning unit which processes the measurement results of single-qubit Pauli operators with the output state from the reservoir. The quantum reservoir effectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit ones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical machine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for quantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning unit, and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum hardware that may be implemented in current experiments. We illustrate the predictive ability of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules with and without noise inevitable in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our scheme reproduces well the first and second excitation energies as well as the transition dipole moment between the ground states and excited states only from the ground states as inputs. We expect our contribution will enhance the applications of quantum computers in the study of quantum chemistry and quantum materials.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe increasing precision of observations of the large-scale structure of the universe has created a problem for simulators: running the simulations necessary to interpret these observations has become impractical. Simulators have thus turned to machine learning (ML) algorithms instead. Though ML decreases computational expense, one might be worried about the use of ML for scientific investigations: How can algorithms that have repeatedly been described as black-boxes deliver scientific understanding? In this paper, I investigate how cosmologists employ ML, arguing that in this context, ML algorithms should not be considered black-boxes and can deliver genuine scientific understanding. Accordingly, understanding the methodological role of ML algorithms is crucial to understanding the types of questions they are capable of, and ought to be responsible for, answering.",

Traffic becomes a growing problem in Istanbul which is Turkey's greatest urban settlement area. Decisions on investments and projections for the public transportation should be well planned by considering the total number of passengers and the variations in the demand on the different regions. The success of this planning is directly related to the accurate passenger demand forecasting. In this study, machine learning algorithms are tested in a real world demand forecasting problem where hourly passenger demands collected from two transfer stations of a public transportation system. The machine learning techniques are run in the WEKA software and the performance of methods are compared by MAE and RMSE statistical measures. The results show that the bagging based decision tree methods and rules methods have the best performance. ",

These transformations are represented as a set of tensor network layers identical to those in a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz tensor network. We perform supervised learning and regression tasks through a model based on a matrix product states (MPSs) acting on the coarse-grained data. Because the entire model consists of tensor contractions (apart from the initial non-linear feature map), we can adaptively fine-grain the optimized MPS model ‘backwards’ through the layers with essentially no loss in performance. The MPS itself is trained using an adaptive algorithm based on the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We test our methods by performing a classification task on audio data and a regression task on temperature time-series data, studying the dependence of training accuracy on the number of coarse-graining layers and showing how fine-graining through the network may be used to initialize models which access finer-scale features.",

Using reinforcement learning and neural networks, we identify three different strategies: a ‘clustering strategy’, where the agents accumulate in regions of high nutrient concentration; a ‘spreading strategy’, where particles stay away from each other to avoid competing for sparse resources; and an ‘adaptive strategy’, where the agents adaptively decide to either follow or stay away from others. Our work exemplifies the idea that machine learning can be used to determine parameters that are evolutionarily optimized in biological systems but often occur as unknown parameters in mathematical models describing their dynamics.",

        "abstract": "In this work we conduct a thorough examination of utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques for classifying meteors based on their characteristics. The focus of the research is the analysis of light curves emitted by meteors as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere, including aspects such as luminosity, duration, and shape. Through extracting features from these light curves and comparing them to established meteors orbits, valuable information about the meteor&#8217;s origin and chemical makeup is sought to be obtained. A significant contribution of the thesis is the development of methods for classifying meteors by extracting features from the light curve shape through the usage of unsupervised classification algorithms. This approach allows for the automatic classification of meteors into various groups based on their properties, obviating the need for manual annotation. Data for the research is collected by a three-camera setup at the Armagh observatory, comprising one medium-angle camera and two wide-angle cameras. This setup enables the capturing of detailed images of meteor light curves, as well as various other observations such as coordinate and angular data. The research also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for data reduction and classification tasks. By applying these techniques to the data collected from the camera setup, the identification of parent objects based on chemical composition and meteor path is facilitated, along with the acquisition of other valuable information about the meteors. In summary, the findings of the research should demonstrate the potential of utilizing machine learning and computer vision methods in the study of meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere. The results contribute to a more profound understanding of the properties and origins of meteors and hold the potential to inform future research in this field.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMachine learning-guided protein engineering continues to rapidly progress, however, collecting large, well-labeled data sets remains time and resource intensive. Directed evolution and protein engineering studies often require extensive experimental processes to eliminate noise and fully label high-throughput protein sequence-function data. Meta learning methods established in other fields (e.g. computer vision and natural language processing) have proven effective in learning from noisy data, given the availability of a small data set with trusted labels and thus could be applied for protein engineering. Here, we generate yeast display antibody mutagenesis libraries and screen them for target antigen binding followed by deep sequencing. Meta learning approaches are able to learn under high synthetic and experimental noise as well as in under labeled data settings, typically outperforming baselines significantly and often requiring a fraction of the training data. Thus, we demonstrate meta learning may expedite and improve machine learning-guided protein engineering.Availability and implementationThe code used in this study is publicly available athttps://github.com/LSSI-ETH/meta-learning-for-protein-engineering.Graphical Abstract",

While sentiment analysis has many applications in English, the Arabic language is still recognizing its early steps in this field. In this paper, we show an application on Arabic sentiment analysis by implementing a sentiment classification for Arabic tweets. The retrieved tweets are analyzed to provide their sentiments polarity (positive, or negative). Since, this data is collected from the social network Twitter; it has its importance for the Middle East region, which mostly speaks Arabic our research was characterized by relying mainly on the XGBoost algorithm, which is considered the most powerful algorithm in the world of big data analysis. The results were compared with several other algorithms that were used to show us the clear difference in terms of accuracy and F1 score between these algorithms and the XGBoost algorithm, The hyperparameters are obtained from the grid search algorithm to get the best performance for each model used in our work.\nThe results showed that our use of the XGBoost model gave more accurate results compared to the previous best-performing models in this field. A website has been created so that the user enters the comment to show him the result (positive comment or negative comment).",

The machine learning methods used are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest (RF). The results of testing the best method are measured based on the value of accuracy. In addition to the accuracy of this study, it also measures the speed of computation so that the methods used are efficient.",

Its analysis generates the opportunity to develop processes to study and solve social problems that affect the people's lives, merging technology and real data. One of the problems in urban areas is the traffic. Every day at big cities people lose time, money, and life quality when they get stuck in traffic jams; another urban problem derived from traffic is air pollution. In the present approach, a traffic event classification methodology is implemented to analyze VGI and internet information related to traffic events with a view to identify the main traffic problems in a city and to visualize the congested roads. The methodology uses different computing tools and algorithms to achieve the goal. To obtain the data, a social media and RSS channels are consulted. The extracted data texts are classified into seven possible traffic events, and geolocalized. In the classification, a machine learning algorithm is applied. ",

        "abstract": "We describe five specific guiding principles for applications of machine learning (ML) to problems in chemistry and material sciences, using data from both experiments and simulations. The principles are the following: 1. Use ML for interpolation but with care for extrapolation; 2. Ensure consistency between sources of data and the targeted application; 3. Correlation is not causation; 4. Optimize information extraction when using ML; 5. Combine different methods, including experiments, theory, and computing to provide a larger window of applications. These principles were developed based on the applications that the authors have been actively involved in, in both industrial and academic settings. Each of these guiding principles is illustrated, using examples from biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, or material science. Examples include Mendeleev's periodic table, estimation of interface adhesion in semiconductor materials, measurements in chemical analysis for cancer chemistry, singularities in evolutionary biology, and the development of faster quantum chemistry methods. The use of specific examples, in turn, will help illustrate the basic premise behind each of the principles. We believe that these unique perspectives highlight potential fallacies in applying these techniques broadly to all problems in natural sciences and engineering, without appropriate bounding of accuracy and precision, especially in areas related to the chemical and materials sciences.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nExcited states of molecules lie in the heart of photochemistry and chemical reactions. The recent development in quantum computational chemistry leads to inventions of a variety of algorithms that calculate the excited states of molecules on near-term quantum computers, but they require more computational burdens than the algorithms for calculating the ground states. In this study, we propose a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts the excited-state properties of molecules only from their ground state wavefunction resulting in reducing the computational cost for calculating the excited states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical machine learning unit which processes the measurement results of single-qubit Pauli operators with the output state from the reservoir. The quantum reservoir effectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit ones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical machine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for quantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning unit, and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum hardware that may be implemented in current experiments. We illustrate the predictive ability of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules with and without noise inevitable in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our scheme reproduces well the first and second excitation energies as well as the transition dipole moment between the ground states and excited states only from the ground states as inputs. We expect our contribution will enhance the applications of quantum computers in the study of quantum chemistry and quantum materials.",

Simulators have thus turned to machine learning (ML) algorithms instead. Though ML decreases computational expense, one might be worried about the use of ML for scientific investigations: How can algorithms that have repeatedly been described as black-boxes deliver scientific understanding? In this paper, I investigate how cosmologists employ ML, arguing that in this context, ML algorithms should not be considered black-boxes and can deliver genuine scientific understanding. Accordingly, understanding the methodological role of ML algorithms is crucial to understanding the types of questions they are capable of, and ought to be responsible for, answering.",

Machine Learning (ML), the application of statistics to complex computational problem solving, was applied to prostate LDR brachytherapy treatment planning. Planning time, pre-implant dosimetry, and various measures of clinical implant quality for ML plans were compared against plans created by expert brachytherapists.\nThe average planning time to create an ML plan was 0.84 _ 0.57 min compared to over 17.88 _ 8.76 min for an experienced brachytherapists. Dosimetry was not significantly different for ML and expert brachytherapist plans. Clinical implant quality for the ML plans were ranked as nearly equivalent to the brachytherapist treatment plans in all qualitative categories evaluated.\nThe results of this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to generate high quality prostate brachytherapy treatment plans with comparable quality to those of a human expert using a custom ML algorithm.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Asteroid families are groups of asteroids that are the product of collisions or of the rotational fission of a parent object. &amp;#160;These groups are mainly identified in proper elements or frequencies domains. &amp;#160; Because of robotic telescope surveys, the number of known asteroids has increased from about 10,000 in the early 90's to more than 750,000 nowadays. Traditional approaches for identifying new members of asteroid families, like the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), may &amp;#160; struggle to keep up with the growing rate of new discoveries. Here we used machine learning classification algorithms to identify new family members based on the orbital distribution in proper (a,e,sin(i)) of previously known family constituents. We compared the outcome of nine classification algorithms from stand alone and ensemble approaches. &amp;#160;The Extremely Randomized Trees (ExtraTree) method had the highest precision, enabling to&amp;#160; retrieve up to 97% of family members identified with standard HCM.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "<p>This paper applies machine learning to modeling power magnetics. We first introduce an open-source database - MagNet - which hosts a large amount of experimentally measured excitation data for many materials across a variety of operating conditions. The processes for data acquisition and data quality control are explained. We then demonstrate a few neural network-based power magnetics modeling tools for modeling core losses and B–H loops. Machine learning allows the many factors that may influence the magnetic characteristics being modeled in a unified framework, and provides insights to quantify the complexity of magnetic characteristics and reduce the size of the measurement data required to build a precise model. Neural network models are found effective in compressing the measurement data and predicting the behaviors of magnetic materials such as the core loss and the B–H loop. The behaviors of a typical power magnetic material (e.g., TDK N87) across a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., temperature, waveform, dc-bias) can be well described by a small-scale neural network (200 KB) which is 10,000 times smaller than the raw measured time-series data (2 GB), paving the way toward using neural networks as an interactive datasheet to assist magnetics design.</p>",

        "abstract": "The ease with which mobile money is used to facilitate cross-border payments presents a global threat to law enforcement in the fight against laundering and terrorist financing. This paper aims to use machine learning classifiers to predict transactions flagged as fraud in mobile money transfers. Data for this paper came from real-time transactions that stimulate a well-known mobile transfer fraud scheme. This paper uses logistic regression as the baseline model and compares it with ensembles and gradient descent models. The results indicate that the established logistic regression model did not perform too poorly compared to the other models. The random forest classifier had the most outstanding performance among all measures. The amount of money transferred was the top feature to predict money laundering transactions through mobile money transfers. These findings suggest that more research is needed to improve the logistic regression model. The random forest classifier should be further explored as a potential tool for law enforcement and financial institutions to detect money laundering activities in mobile money transfers.\n",

        "abstract": "Currently, herbs recognition system has become a promising method to identify herbs species. Misuse of herbal medicine can cause serious health problems due to toxicological effects of phytochemical. As a result, a system that able to distinguish the types of herbs is needed. Most herbs recognition systems available in the market are dependent on experts. In this research, the concern is to identify the herbs compounds within the same group species where the physical appearance and aroma are similar. The work mainly focuses on herbs recognition system that intended for researchers and medical practitioners use without the need for experts. Electronic Nose (E-Nose) devices have been used extensively to differentiate and characterize the herb species based on their unique odour. Electrical signal generated from the gas sensor array is one of the physical properties studied. The robustness test of the proposed herbs recognition systems is performed via four classification models based on machine learning algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR), and Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. The performance of the classification accuracy using KNN shows a better result within the family group from 92.15% to 100% compared to the others method.",

        "abstract": "AbstractModel-agnostic tools for the post-hoc interpretation of machine-learning models struggle to summarize the joint effects of strongly dependent features in high-dimensional feature spaces, which play an important role in semantic image classification, for example in remote sensing of landcover. This contribution proposes a novel approach that interprets machine-learning models through the lens of feature-space transformations. It can be used to enhance unconditional as well as conditional post-hoc diagnostic tools including partial-dependence plots, accumulated local effects (ALE) plots, permutation feature importance, or Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). While the approach can also be applied to nonlinear transformations, linear ones are particularly appealing, especially principal component analysis (PCA) and a proposed partial orthogonalization technique. Moreover, structured PCA and model diagnostics along user-defined synthetic features offer opportunities for representing domain knowledge. The new approach is implemented in the R package , which can be combined with existing explainable machine-learning packages. A case study on remote-sensing landcover classification with 46 features is used to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for model interpretation by domain experts. It is most useful in situations where groups of feature are linearly dependent and PCA can provide meaningful multivariate data summaries.",

Then, based on this distribution, the study aimed to compare the number of vaccinations, deaths, and cases and analyze the relationship between these numbers and the mindset of the society. (2) To analyze people's tweets about the vaccine and compare them with the number of people vaccinated, in order to determine if there was a significant result. The study analyzed data from 17 countries among the top 20 countries with the highest gross national product in 2020. Machine learning methods such as multinomial logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, and ridge classification were used to evaluate the performance of predictive models. The accuracy achieved by these models were as follows: naive Bayes (76%), random forest (85.03%), ridge classification (85.72%), and multinomial logistic regression (86.67%). In conclusion, the study found that with increasing vaccination rates, positive interpretations of vaccines differed more than other moods. The study contributes to advancing awareness of the public's perception of COVID-19 vaccinations and supports the goal of eliminating coronavirus from the planet.",

However, personalized medicine has only been described on an informal level rather than through rigorous practical guidelines and statistical protocols that would allow its robust practical realization for implementation in day-to-day clinical practice. In this paper, we discuss three key factors, which we consider dimensions that effect the experimental design for personalized medicine: (I) phenotype categories; (II) population size; and (III) statistical analysis. This formalization allows us to define personalized medicine from a machine learning perspective, as an automized, comprehensive knowledge base with an ontology that performs pattern recognition of patient profiles.",

Even though sign language is crucial for deaf-mute persons to communicate with other people and with themselves, regular people still pay it little attention. Normal people often overlook the value of sign language unless they have family members who are deaf-mute. Using sign language interpreters is one way to communicate with those who are deaf-mute. However, hiring sign language interpreters can be expensive. A model that can automatically convert their motions into words can be used as a low-cost replacement for the interpreters. This chapter gives the description about the development of a model which helps automatic detection of actions with real time using the Mediapipe model and then with the help of sign language conversion model it translates into the textual format.",

However, such structural information has so far not been provided in the form of a complete relative coordinate system. We present a decoupled coordinate system consisting of bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles, and show that it is complete. By incorporating this set of coordinates in a linker generation framework, we show that it has a significant impact on the quality of the generated linkers. To elucidate the advantages of such a coordinate system, we investigate the amount of reliable information within the different types of degrees of freedom using both detailed ablation studies and an information-theoretical analysis. The presented benefits suggest the application of a complete and decoupled relative coordinate system as a standard good practice in linker design.",

These pre-categorized training datasets are used by machine learning techniques to classify datasets into relevant and acceptable categories. Using the incoming training data, machine learning classifiers assess the chance or probability that the incoming data will fall into one of the established categories. One of categorization's most prominent applications is used by the largest email service providers of today: classifying emails as “spam” or “non-spam.” In essence, classification is a form of “pattern recognition.” Following the application of classification algorithms to the training data, the same pattern (similar number sequences, words, or attitudes, etc.) is found in future data sets. Classification falls within the category of supervised learning in the context of machine learning.",

The occurrence of these specific problems for the suppliers and operators is often related to the bullwhip effect. For studying such a problem, a research proposal is herein presented. Studying the bullwhip effect in the O & G industry requires collecting data from different levels of the supply chain, namely: services, upstream and midstream suppliers, and downstream clients. The first phase of the proposed research consists of gathering the available production and financial data. A second phase will be the statistical treatment of the data in order to evaluate the importance of the bullwhip effect in the oil and gas industry. The third phase of the program involves applying artificial neural networks (ANN) to forecast the demand. At this stage, ANN based on different training methods will be used. Further on, the attained mathematical model will be used to simulate the effects of demand fluctuations and assess the bullwhip effect in an oil and gas supply chain.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. High-resolution modelling of surface ozone is an essential step in the quantification of the impacts on health and ecosystems from historic and future concentrations. It also provides a principled way in which to extend analysis beyond measurement locations. Often, such modelling uses relatively coarse resolution chemistry transport models (CTMs), which exhibit biases when compared to measurements. EMEP4UK is a CTM that is used extensively to inform UK air quality policy, including the effects on ozone from mitigation of its precursors. Our evaluation of EMEP4UK for the years 2001–2018 finds a high bias in reproducing daily maximum 8-hr average ozone (MDA8), due in part to the coarse spatial resolution. We present a machine learning downscaling methodology to downscale EMEP4UK ozone output from a 5 × 5 km to 1 × 1 km resolution using a gradient boosted tree. By addressing the high bias present in EMEP4UK, the downscaled surface better represents the measured data, with a 128 % improvement in R2 and 37 % reduction in RMSE. Our analysis of the downscaled surface shows a decreasing trend in annual and March–August mean MDA8 ozone for all regions of the UK between 2001–2018, differing from increasing measurement trends in some regions. We find the proportion of the UK which fails the government objective to have at most 10 exceedances of 100 µg/m3 per annum is 27 % (2014–2018 average), compared to 99 % from the unadjusted EMEP4UK model. A statistically significant trend in this proportion of −2.19 %/year is found from the downscaled surface only, highlighting the importance of bias correction in the assessment of policy metrics. Finally, we use the downscaling approach to examine the sensitivity of UK surface ozone to reductions in UK terrestrial NOx (i.e., NO + NO2) emissions on a 1 × 1 km surface. Moderate NOx emission reductions with respect to present day (20 % or 40 %) increase both average and high-level ozone concentrations in large portions of the UK, whereas larger NOx reductions (80 %) cause a similarly wide-spread decrease in high-level ozone. In all three scenarios, very urban areas (i.e., major cities) are the most affected by increasing concentrations of ozone, emphasising the broader air quality challenges of NOx control.\n                        ",

        "abstract": "The paper commences with an introduction to blended learning, an educational approach that amalgamates traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning, aiming to capitalize on the advantages of conventional classroom instruction and digital resources in order to enhance the overall learning experience. The incorporation of diverse technologies facilitates a personalized learning experience that caters to the needs and learning styles of individual students. Image classification entails training machine learning models to categorize or label images into predetermined classes or categories, empowering machines to recognize and comprehend crucial components of visual information, emulating humans' classification of objects in the real world. The crux of image classification relies on extracting meaningful features from images and distinguishing different categories by associating specific features with distinct classes through iterative optimization learning. Machine learning significantly aids image classification by endowing automated systems with the capability to discern patterns, features, and distinctions within datasets, ultimately achieving accurate image classification. The integration of hybrid learning methods can augment the training process for machine learning models used in image classification by providing a flexible and adaptive learning environment.",

The desire to automate maximum construction processes with less human interference has led the industry and research community to inclined towards artificial intelligence. This chapter has been themed on automated construction monitoring practices by adopting material classification via machine learning (ML) techniques. The study has been conducted by following the structure review approach to gain an understanding of the applications of ML techniques for construction progress assessment. Data were collected from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, concluding 14 relevant studies. The literature review depicted the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques as more effective than other ML techniques for material classification. The last section of this chapter includes a python-based ANN model for material classification. This ANN model has been tested for construction items (brick, wood, concrete block, and asphalt) for training and prediction. Moreover, the predictive ANN model results have been shared for the readers, along with the resources and open-source web links.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTraffic congestion is one of the problems for cities around the world due to the rapid increasing of vehicles in urbanization. Traffic flow prediction is of a great importance for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) which helps to optimize the traffic regulation of a transportation in the city. Nowadays, several researches have been studied so far on traffic flow prediction, accurate prediction has not yet been exploited by most of existing studies due to the impact of inability to effectively deal with spatial temporal features of the times series data. Traffic information in transportation system will also be affected by different factors. In this research we intended to study various models for Traffic flow prediction on the basis machine learning and deep learning approaches. Factors affecting the performance of traffic flow prediction intensity are studied as well. Benchmark performance evaluation metrics are also reviewed.  Generally, this manuscript covers relevant methods and approaches, review the state-of-art works with respect to different traffic flow prediction technique help researchers in exploring future directions so as to realize robust traffic flow prediction.",

        "abstract": "Geothermal is a renewable energy source that can provide reliable and flexible electricity generation for the world. In the past decade, play fairway analysis (PFA) studies identified that geothermal resources without surface expression (e.g., blind/hidden hydrothermal systems) have vast potential. However, a comprehensive search for these blind systems can be time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, with a low probability of success. Accelerated discovery of these blind resources is needed with growing energy needs and higher chances of exploration success. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in shortening the timeline for this discovery. This paper presents a novel ML-based methodology for geothermal exploration towards PFA applications. Our methodology is provided through our open-source ML framework, GeoThermalCloud https://github.com/SmartTensors/GeoThermalCloud.jl. The GeoThermalCloud uses a series of un-supervised, supervised, and physics-informed ML methods available in SmartTensors AI platform https://github.com/SmartTensors. Through GeoThermalCloud, we can identify hidden patterns in the geothermal field data needed to discover blind systems efficiently. Crucial geothermal signatures often overlooked in traditional PFA are extracted using the GeoThermalCloud and analyzed by the subject matter experts to provide ML-enhanced PFA (ePFA), which is informative for efficient exploration. We applied our ML methodology to various open-source geothermal datasets within the U.S. (some of these are collected by past PFA work). The results provide valuable insights into resource types within those regions. This ML-enhanced workflow makes the GeoThermalCloud attractive for the geothermal community to improve existing datasets and extract valuable information often unnoticed during geothermal exploration.\n\n",

        "abstract": "Hybrid machine learning encompasses predefinition of rules and ongoing learning from data. Human organizations can implement hybrid machine learning (HML) to automate some of their operations. Human organizations need to ensure that their HML implementations are aligned with human ethical requirements as defined in laws, regulations, standards, etc. The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate technical opportunities for representing human ethical requirements in HML. The study sought to represent two types of human ethical requirements in HML: locally simple and locally complex. The locally simple case is road traffic regulations. This can be considered to be a relatively simple case because human ethical requirements for road safety, such as stopping at red traffic lights, are defined clearly and have limited scope for personal interpretation. The locally complex case is diagnosis procedures for functional disorders, which can include medically unexplained symptoms. This case can be considered to be locally complex because human ethical requirements for functional disorder healthcare are less well defined and are more subject to personal interpretation. Representations were made in a type of HML called Algebraic Machine Learning. Our findings indicate that there are technical opportunities to represent human ethical requirements in HML because of its combination of human-defined top down rules and bottom up data-driven learning. However, our findings also indicate that there are limitations to representing human ethical requirements: irrespective of what type of machine learning is used. These limitations arise from fundamental challenges in defining complex ethical requirements, and from potential for opposing interpretations of their implementation. Furthermore, locally simple ethical requirements can contribute to wider ethical complexity.",

By using effective performance prediction methods, instructional leaders can allocate adequate resources and instruction more accurately. This paper aims to identify the features of machine learning algorithms that can be used to make predictions about student grades. For this purpose, we use a data set that contains personal information about students and their grades. We have implemented different machine learning algorithms of regression namely: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network. Then, we compared these models based on their determination coefficient, Mean Average Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error. The experimental results of this study showed that the deep neural network outperformed the other algorithms with a determination coefficient of 99.97% and low errors.",

        "abstract": "Geothermal is a renewable energy source that can provide reliable and flexible electricity generation for the world. In the past decade, play fairway analysis (PFA) studies identified that geothermal resources without surface expression (e.g., blind/hidden hydrothermal systems) have vast potential. However, a comprehensive search for these blind systems can be time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, with a low probability of success. Accelerated discovery of these blind resources is needed with growing energy needs and higher chances of exploration success. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in shortening the timeline for this discovery. This paper presents a novel ML-based methodology for geothermal exploration towards PFA applications. Our methodology is provided through our open-source ML framework, GeoThermalCloud https://github.com/SmartTensors/GeoThermalCloud.jl. The GeoThermalCloud uses a series of un-supervised, supervised, and physics-informed ML methods available in SmartTensors AI platform https://github.com/SmartTensors. Through GeoThermalCloud, we can identify hidden patterns in the geothermal field data needed to discover blind systems efficiently. Crucial geothermal signatures often overlooked in traditional PFA are extracted using the GeoThermalCloud and analyzed by the subject matter experts to provide ML-enhanced PFA (ePFA), which is informative for efficient exploration. We applied our ML methodology to various open-source geothermal datasets within the U.S. (some of these are collected by past PFA work). The results provide valuable insights into resource types within those regions. This ML-enhanced workflow makes the GeoThermalCloud attractive for the geothermal community to improve existing datasets and extract valuable information often unnoticed during geothermal exploration.\n\n",

Searching through vast regions of chemical space for routes to new molecules is a time-consuming process carried out by expert synthetic chemists. The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for synthetic chemistry is rapidly expanding, the aim being to reduce the timelines of chemical syntheses. Tools, which predict products of chemical reactions and design retrosynthetic routes, are attracting particular attention. Emerging computer-aided synthesis design (CASD) programs are not intended to replace synthetic chemists but to aid them in everyday decision making. The incorporation of condition optimisation and reaction performance is highly desirable. Combining such tools with an automated synthesis testing module holds much promise for the future of reaction condition optimisation. To achieve the desired progress in, and acceptance of CASD, there are a few challenges that need to be addressed.",

        "abstract": "Hybrid machine learning encompasses predefinition of rules and ongoing learning from data. Human organizations can implement hybrid machine learning (HML) to automate some of their operations. Human organizations need to ensure that their HML implementations are aligned with human ethical requirements as defined in laws, regulations, standards, etc. The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate technical opportunities for representing human ethical requirements in HML. The study sought to represent two types of human ethical requirements in HML: locally simple and locally complex. The locally simple case is road traffic regulations. This can be considered to be a relatively simple case because human ethical requirements for road safety, such as stopping at red traffic lights, are defined clearly and have limited scope for personal interpretation. The locally complex case is diagnosis procedures for functional disorders, which can include medically unexplained symptoms. This case can be considered to be locally complex because human ethical requirements for functional disorder healthcare are less well defined and are more subject to personal interpretation. Representations were made in a type of HML called Algebraic Machine Learning. Our findings indicate that there are technical opportunities to represent human ethical requirements in HML because of its combination of human-defined top down rules and bottom up data-driven learning. However, our findings also indicate that there are limitations to representing human ethical requirements: irrespective of what type of machine learning is used. These limitations arise from fundamental challenges in defining complex ethical requirements, and from potential for opposing interpretations of their implementation. Furthermore, locally simple ethical requirements can contribute to wider ethical complexity.",

One prominent\n                    example is the area of automated driving. However, there is much discussion\n                    regarding whether ML-based vehicle functions can be engineered to be acceptably\n                    safe, with concerns related to the inherent difficulty and ambiguity of the\n                    tasks to which the technology is applied. This leads to challenges in defining\n                    adequately safe responses for all possible situations and an acceptable level of\n                    residual risk, which is then compounded by the reliance on training data.</div><div class=\"htmlview paragraph\"><b>The Path to Safe Machine Learning for Automotive Applications</b>\n                    discusses the challenges involved in the application of ML to safety-critical\n                    vehicle functions and provides a set of recommendations within the context of\n                    current and upcoming safety standards. In summary, the potential of ML will only\n                    be unlocked for safety-related functions if the inevitable uncertainties\n                    associated with both the specification and performance of the trained models can\n                    be sufficiently well understood and controlled within the application-specific\n                    context.</div><div class=\"htmlview paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.sae.org/publications/edge-research-reports\" target=\"_blank\">Click\n                        here to access the full SAE EDGE</a><sup>TM</sup><a href=\"https://www.sae.org/publications/edge-research-reports\" target=\"_blank\">\n                        Research Report portfolio.</a></div></div>",

To solve this problem and achieve more than 90 score in dev dataset, we present a simple method to find the noisy data and re-label the noisy data by human, given the model predictions as references in human labeling. In this paper, we illustrate our idea for a broad set of deep learning tasks, includes classification, sequence tagging, object detection, sequence generation, click-through rate prediction. The experimental results and human evaluation results verify our idea.",

Machine Learning (ML), the application of statistics to complex computational problem solving, was applied to prostate LDR brachytherapy treatment planning. Planning time, pre-implant dosimetry, and various measures of clinical implant quality for ML plans were compared against plans created by expert brachytherapists.\nThe average planning time to create an ML plan was 0.84 _ 0.57 min compared to over 17.88 _ 8.76 min for an experienced brachytherapists. Dosimetry was not significantly different for ML and expert brachytherapist plans. Clinical implant quality for the ML plans were ranked as nearly equivalent to the brachytherapist treatment plans in all qualitative categories evaluated.\nThe results of this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to generate high quality prostate brachytherapy treatment plans with comparable quality to those of a human expert using a custom ML algorithm.",

        "abstract": "How the use of machine learning to analyze art images has revived formalism in art history, presenting a golden opportunity for art historians and computer scientists to learn from one another.\nThough formalism is an essential tool for art historians, much recent art history has focused on the social and political aspects of art. But now art historians are adopting machine learning methods to develop new ways to analyze the purely visual in datasets of art images. Amanda Wasielewski uses the term “computational formalism” todescribe this use of machine learning and computer vision technique in art historical research. At the same time that art historians are analyzing art images in new ways, computer scientists are using art images for experiments in machine learning and computer vision. Their research, says Wasielewski, would be greatly enriched by the inclusion of humanistic issues.\nThe main purpose in applying computational techniques such as machine learning to art datasets is to automate the process of categorization using metrics such as style, a historically fraught concept in art history. After examining a fifteen-year trajectory in image categorization and art dataset creation in the fields of machine learning and computer vision, Wasielewski considers deep learning techniques that both create and detect forgeries and fakes in art. She investigates examples of art historical analysis in the fields of computer and information sciences, placing this research in the context of art historiography. She also raises questions as which artworks are chosen for digitization, and of those artworks that are born digital, which works gain acceptance into the canon of high art.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;A key component of a weather service&amp;#8217;s mission is to capture accurate observations of weather conditions in real-time, which are subsequently fed into forecasting models for prediction, used in climate research, and form the basis of the official climate statistics. The accuracy of such measurements is ensured by following a set of robust procedures set out in the World Meteorological Organisation guidelines. In addition to appropriate maintenance and calibration of equipment, procedures for quality control (QC) of observations are necessary in order for users to have maximum confidence in the data. Much of this QC tends to be done manually by expert climatologists who examine data and flag erroneous values. However, due to the current proliferation of climate data, more and more organisations are seeking to implement automated, real-time QC to prevent poor quality data being used in operational products. One potential approach is to use Anomaly Detection algorithms to identify potentially erroneous values. Such methods are a well-established field in Machine Learning and are a potential tool for QC of environmental data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper develops and evaluates models to perform automatic QC of Irish weather data (from the Irish meteorological agency Met E&amp;#769;ireann) using appropriate Machine Learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN&amp;#8217;s). The outcomes are evaluated in comparison to standard statistical tests which have traditionally been used for these purposes (such as linear regression spatial variability tests). The dataset in question consists of over 10 years of automated temperature observations taken at one minute intervals using Platinum Resistance Thermometers (PRT&amp;#8217;s) located at sites across the country. This is complemented by a related data set that has been manually quality-controlled using well established methods, which can be used for comparison and verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper aims to investigate whether anomaly detection algorithms can correctly identify erroneous values in the time-series to at least the same standard as that achieved through traditional manual approaches. Furthermore, it examines whether these anomalies, once discovered, can be classified into categories with interpretable physical meaning.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "We describe a method for learning higher-level vector representations of interactions between molecular features and biology. We named the representations as the reason vectors. In contrast to the high-dimensional chemical fingerprints, reason vectors are much simpler with only about 5 dimensions. They allow abstract reasoning for bioactivity of chemicals or absence thereof, uncover causal factors in interactions between chemical features and generalize beyond specific chemical classes or bioactivity. These qualities enable us to perform powerful similarity searches that are vague and conceptual in nature. The methodology can handle novel combinations of features in query molecules and can evaluate chemical classes that are entirely absent in training data. The method consists of similarity-based near neighbor search on a reference database of biologically tested chemicals by a series of substructures obtained from stepwise reconstruction of the test molecule. A data-driven continuous representation of molecular fragments was used for molecular similarity computations. The technique was inspired by the ability of humans to learn and generalize complex concepts by interacting with the physical world. We also show that activity prediction of chemicals using the abstract reason vectors is very easy and straightforward, as compared to modeling in the raw chemistry space, and can be applied to both binary and continuous activity outcomes. Except for utilizing an unsupervised training to construct continuous molecular fingerprints, the methodology is devoid of gradient optimization or statistical fitting.",

        "abstract": "New parents are frequently awakened by the cries of their newborn babies. Attempts to stop these cries sometimes result in increasingly louder cries. By first transforming these cries into waveforms, and then into sound spectrograms, the efficiencies and accuracies of different computer learning modules were tested: a support vector machine, a 2-layer neural network, and a long short-term memory model. Finally, an automatic sorter that categorizes each cry was developed. Using this method, it is possible to eliminate error and time wastage when trying to calm a baby. The results of testing the programs demonstrate a high accuracy rate for determining the source of a baby’s cries. This program will enable parents to calm their crying babies in a shorter amount of time, giving them more peace of mind, and perhaps allowing them to get more sleep.",

        "abstract": "IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence are currently three of the most relevant and trending pieces for innovation and predictive analysis in healthcare. Many healthcare organizations are already working on developing their own home-centric data collection networks and intelligent big data analytics systems based on machine-learning principles. The benefit of using IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence for community and population health is better health outcomes for the population and communities. The new generation of machine-learning algorithms can use large standardized data sets generated in healthcare to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. A lot of these data come from sensors, devices, electronic health records (EHR), data generated by public health nurses, mobile data, social media, and the internet. This chapter shows a high-level implementation of a complete solution of IoT, big data, and machine learning implemented in the city of Cartagena, Colombia for hypertensive patients by using an eHealth sensor and Amazon Web Services components.",

That paper focuses on exploratory data analysis and YOLOv3, you only look once at version three, a real-time recognizing model. The hypothesis of this research are, a cyber-attack gives the same pattern in all the different, different IP addresses, and the research model, the YOLOv3 model can detect the cyber-attack by seeing its pattern. First, the researcher collects more than one hundred seventy-eight thousand data from the cyber department of some companies. Then, the researcher does exploratory data analysis of that data in the jupyter notebook. Then, the researcher finds all the important information about cyber-attacks. Then, the researcher finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks from the information of the data collection. Then, the researcher collects pictures of the patterns. Then, with pictures of those patterns, the researcher labeled those pictures by labellmg software and create a zip file of them. Then the researcher use Google colab and trained, \"you only look once version three\", the YOLOv3 model to detect the name of the pattern. The machine can detect the pattern and can tell us about what cyber-attack it is by only seeing the picture of the pattern. The researcher finds the patterns for eight IP addresses and in all the IP addresses, the attacks give the same patterns. So, the hypothesis is true in all that cases. By this research model, we can easily know about any kind of cyber-attack in detail and also can find the cyber-attacks by their patterns. So, the researcher use jupyter notebook, Google Colab, and pycharm environment. Pattern study always plays an important role to know about anything. By knowing and learning about anything’s pattern, we can easily understand anything. This research does that thing greatly. The researcher first finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks, then make a model which can detect the cyber-attack by just seeing the pattern.",

Addition to this it includes a small description of naïve bayes classifier which used to be used through the authors. It explains the significance of training facts set and trying out information set in Machine mastering techniques. Machine learning nowadays becomes plenty used technique in the field of IT industry. It is a very effective instrument and technique for many quite a number fields such as education, IT and even in enterprise industry. In this paper, the researcher attempt to find computerized end result reputation of scholarships of college students by way of using naïve bayes classifier algorithm primarily based on the scholar educational performance, conversation skills, greedy power, IHS, income, time management, regularity etc. A scholarship offers a strength and self assurance to a student. It also boosts the performance of students indirectly. Usually scholarships are furnished by governments or authorities organizations. It is very essential for students to recognize their personal potentiality early in their educational profession so that they faster its growth, receiving attention from an employer or corporation helps college students take this step. Students can apply for scholarships primarily based on the eligibility criteria (such as caste category, annual income, etc). The scholarship will be issued based on merit, student performance and career specific. Different schemes of scholarships are provided for the students based on distinct eligibility criteria. By the use of a naïve bayes classifier, the researcher acquired a end result with accuracy of 96.7% and error of 3.3%. The repute of scholarship students was once displayed in the form of yes or no.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning methods are frequently used to detect behavioral and ecological data patterns. Even though these new mathematical methods are useful tools, the results are often ambivalent if we do not utilize biologically relevant parameters in the analyses. In our experiment, we analyzed whether the bout length of behavior elements could be a relevant parameter to determine the window length used by the machine learning method. We defined eight behavior elements and collected motion data with a smartwatch attached to the dog’s collar. The behavior sequences of 56 freely moving dogs from various breeds were analyzed by deploying a specific software (SensDog). The behavior recognition was based on binary classification that was evaluated with a Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) learning algorithm, a boosted decision-tree-based method with a 3-fold cross-validation. We used the sliding window technique during the signal processing, and we aimed at finding the best window size for the analysis of each behavior element to achieve the most effective settings. Our results showed that in the case of all behavior elements the best recognition with the highest AUC values was achieved when the window size corresponded to the median bout length of that particular behavior. In summary, the most effective strategy to improve significantly the accuracy of the recognition of behavioral elements is using behavior-specific parameters in the binary classification models, choosing behavior-specific window sizes (even when using the same ML model) and synchronizing the bout length of the behavior element with the time window length.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a world-wide trend has been observed that there is widespread adoption across all fields to embrace smart environments and automation. Smart environments include a wide variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, so many challenges face conventional digital forensic investigation (DFI) in such environments. These challenges include data heterogeneity, data distribution, and massive amounts of data, which exceed digital forensic (DF) investigators’ human capabilities to deal with all of these challenges within a short period of time. Furthermore, they significantly slow down or even incapacitate the conventional DFI process. With the increasing frequency of digital crimes, better and more sophisticated DFI procedures are desperately needed, particularly in such environments. Since machine-learning (ML) techniques might be a viable option in smart environments, this paper presents the integration of ML into DF, through reviewing the most recent papers concerned with the applications of ML in DF, specifically within smart environments. It also explores the potential further use of ML techniques in DF in smart environments to reduce the hard work of human beings, as well what to expect from future ML applications to the conventional DFI process.",

        "abstract": "Applying machine learning algorithms for encryption problems is reasonable in today's research connecting with cryptography. Using an encryption standard such as DES can give insight into how machine learning can help in breaking the encryption standards. The inspiration for this chapter is to use machine learning to reverse engineer hash functions. Hash functions are supposed to be tough to reverse one-way functions. The hash function will be learned by machine learning algorithm with a probability of more than 50%, which means the can develop their guesstimate of the reverse. This is concluded by executing the DES symmetric encryption function to generate N numerous values of DES with a set key and the machine learning algorithm is trained on a neural network to identify the first bit of the input based on the value of the function's output. Testing has ended through a new table, which was created similarly but with different inputs. The SVM runs on the new table, and it compares to the other table, and a confusion matrix is used to measure the excellence of the guesstimates.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning methods are frequently used to detect behavioral and ecological data patterns. Even though these new mathematical methods are useful tools, the results are often ambivalent if we do not utilize biologically relevant parameters in the analyses. In our experiment, we analyzed whether the bout length of behavior elements could be a relevant parameter to determine the window length used by the machine learning method. We defined eight behavior elements and collected motion data with a smartwatch attached to the dog’s collar. The behavior sequences of 56 freely moving dogs from various breeds were analyzed by deploying a specific software (SensDog). The behavior recognition was based on binary classification that was evaluated with a Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) learning algorithm, a boosted decision-tree-based method with a 3-fold cross-validation. We used the sliding window technique during the signal processing, and we aimed at finding the best window size for the analysis of each behavior element to achieve the most effective settings. Our results showed that in the case of all behavior elements the best recognition with the highest AUC values was achieved when the window size corresponded to the median bout length of that particular behavior. In summary, the most effective strategy to improve significantly the accuracy of the recognition of behavioral elements is using behavior-specific parameters in the binary classification models, choosing behavior-specific window sizes (even when using the same ML model) and synchronizing the bout length of the behavior element with the time window length.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a world-wide trend has been observed that there is widespread adoption across all fields to embrace smart environments and automation. Smart environments include a wide variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, so many challenges face conventional digital forensic investigation (DFI) in such environments. These challenges include data heterogeneity, data distribution, and massive amounts of data, which exceed digital forensic (DF) investigators’ human capabilities to deal with all of these challenges within a short period of time. Furthermore, they significantly slow down or even incapacitate the conventional DFI process. With the increasing frequency of digital crimes, better and more sophisticated DFI procedures are desperately needed, particularly in such environments. Since machine-learning (ML) techniques might be a viable option in smart environments, this paper presents the integration of ML into DF, through reviewing the most recent papers concerned with the applications of ML in DF, specifically within smart environments. It also explores the potential further use of ML techniques in DF in smart environments to reduce the hard work of human beings, as well what to expect from future ML applications to the conventional DFI process.",

Researchers are trying their hard to fight against various genetic diseases like cancer. Artificial intelligence has empowered research in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the availability of opensource healthcare datasets has motivated the researchers to develop applications which can help in early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Further, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has helped to look into detailed intricacies of biological systems. It has provided an efficient and cost-effective approach with higher accuracy. The advent of microRNAs also known as small noncoding genes has begun the paradigm shift in oncological research. We are now able to profile expression profiles of RNAs using RNA-seq data. microRNA profiling has helped in uncovering their relationship in various genetic and biological processes. Here in this chapter, the authors present a review of the machine learning perspective in cancer research. ",

        "abstract": "Applying machine learning algorithms for encryption problems is reasonable in today's research connecting with cryptography. Using an encryption standard such as DES can give insight into how machine learning can help in breaking the encryption standards. The inspiration for this chapter is to use machine learning to reverse engineer hash functions. Hash functions are supposed to be tough to reverse one-way functions. The hash function will be learned by machine learning algorithm with a probability of more than 50%, which means the can develop their guesstimate of the reverse. This is concluded by executing the DES symmetric encryption function to generate N numerous values of DES with a set key and the machine learning algorithm is trained on a neural network to identify the first bit of the input based on the value of the function's output. Testing has ended through a new table, which was created similarly but with different inputs. The SVM runs on the new table, and it compares to the other table, and a confusion matrix is used to measure the excellence of the guesstimates.",

Not a day goes by without another proof of principle being published on how ML methods can represent and predict quantum mechanical properties—be they observable, such as molecular polarizabilities, or not, such as atomic charges. As ML is becoming pervasive in electronic structure theory and molecular simulation, we provide an overview of how atomistic computational modeling is being transformed by the incorporation of ML approaches. From the perspective of the practitioner in the field, we assess how common workflows to predict structure, dynamics, and spectroscopy are affected by ML. Finally, we discuss how a tighter and lasting integration of ML methods with computational chemistry and materials science can be achieved and what it will mean for research practice, software development, and postgraduate training.",

Structural classification is the area of research that this thesis focuses on. We use visualizations of proteins to build a machine learning class prediction model, that successfully classifies proteins using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) framework. SCOP is a well-researched classification with many approaches using a representation of a proteins secondary structure in a linear chain of structures. This thesis uses a novel approach of rendering a three dimensional visualization of the protein itself and then applying image based machine learning to determine a protein’s SCOP classification. The resulting convolutional neural network (CNN) method has achieved average accuracies in the range 78-87% on the 25PDB dataset, which is better than or equal to the existing methods.</p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCondition Monitoring usually analyzes each measurement separately using static limit information. This results in false alarms and unhealthy conditions that are not alarmed. Using machine learning techniques, the big data gathered around large equipment or an entire plant can be analyzed as a single coherent whole to draw conclusions about its current state of health. First, a mathematical model of the relevant measurement is created using the other measurements available. This model represents the equipment or plant as a unit when it is operating as it should. Second, this expected value is compared to the measured value. If they agree, the current state is healthy. If they do not, an alarm is released and a maintenance activity must follow. This method is seen to be far more successful than standard condition monitoring thus preventing false alarms and always alarming unhealthy states.",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;A purely statistical machine learning (ML) approach was applied to forecast near-surface temperature and precipitation anomalies over land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and Tropics. A high number of principal components (PCs) from the key variables, most importantly sea surface temperatures and the near-tropopause geopotential from reanalyses, was used as predictors to forecast the 2-weekly mean predictand anomalies in each location. Separate models were fitted for different seasons and lead times in the range of 1&amp;#8211;6 weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To select and weight the predictors and to reduce the risk of overfitting, such ML methods as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization and ensembling based on random sampling of the predictor data were used in addition to the dimensionality reduction with PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skill analysis of the independent test sample results show that both the climatological and persistence reference forecasts were inferior compared to the ML approach on average, with all lead times, and in the majority of the target grid cells. Also, the ML approach achieved a skill that was generally comparable to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) dynamical model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, these particular ML methods have been shown to work in a regional approach in Europe for seasonal time scales. According to the new results, they also work in the near-global domain and in the challenging subseasonal time scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

        "abstract": "Every year, enormous project failure rates plague business companies across the globe, costing millions of dollars for each failed project. It is critical to understand the factors that influence project success. The goal of this study is to empirically discover the factors that lead to a successful project. This study used data from 469 projects to use three distinct supervised machine learning methods for classification: a) The Support Vector Machine (SVM), 2) The Probit regression, and 3) the Logistic regression. Five factors have been chosen.: Support from the top management, Technical skills, Client’s acceptance, Communication, and Monitoring. The findings of the SVM study revealed that SVM could accurately predict successful and unsuccessful projects. The findings of Logistic and Probit regression revealed that project success is more likely if project managers get appropriate top-level support and if the project team has sufficient technical capabilities. This study also discovered that good communication and control improve the odds of a project's success. However, according to the results of this research, client acceptability is a minor success factor for a project.",

        "published": "2023-4-12",
        "citations": 0,
        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper develops an account of model evaluation—with an emphasis on fairness concerns—that takes the social situatedness of ML models as its starting point. Such a view entails that ML models are not deemed isolated entities, but rather tools, used for specific purposes and potentially impacting their social environment in manifold ways. This shift of perspective opens up a new problem space and facilitates rethinking criteria for model evaluation. By drawing on the adequacy-for-purpose view in philosophy of science, epistemic norms and desiderata for an adequate deployment of ML models along the dimensions of Social Objectives, Measurement, Social Dynamics, and interaction are then identified. The account thus developed also highlights why any auditing of ML models that ought to assist in consequential decision-making cannot be limited to an assessment of statistical properties, but needs to incorporate a variety of methods from the social sciences instead. Moreover, while the process of model evaluation might be deemed as a mere technical exercise, it is in fact riddled by epistemic and morally normative considerations.\n",

        "abstract": "Due to global scale problems (e.g. exponential population growth), catalytic processes are of more importance today than they have ever been before. The industrialisation of these processes requires kinetic models. Mechanistic models are difficult to construct; data-driven and hybrid models, although easier to construct, lack interpretability and physical knowledge. Recently, a new approach called automated knowledge discovery has been popularised, but existing methods in the literature suffer from important drawbacks: necessitating assumptions about model structures and a lack of model selection routine (both being directly linked to kinetic model building). As such, this motivated the presented work to construct a generalisable methodological framework for the automated discovery of catalytic kinetic models. The methodological framework proposed utilises symbolic regression for model generation, a hybrid optimisation algorithm for parameter estimation, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Hunter–Reiner criterion for model selection and discrimination, respectively. The methodology was applied to an illustrative isomerisation case study, where concentration versus time data were provided for three different experiments (i.e. each experiment has different initial conditions). The framework was able to retrieve the correct kinetic model with realistic (i.e. noisy) data from the catalytic system. This exemplifies how the presented methodology can be harnessed to efficiently provide important and interpretable insights of catalytical systems that have not yet been researched.",

        "abstract": "Continual learning (CL), also known as lifelong learning, is an emerging research topic that has been attracting increasing interest in the field of machine learning. With human activity recognition (HAR) playing a key role in enabling numerous real-world applications, an essential step towards the long-term deployment of such systems is to extend the activity model to dynamically adapt to changes in people’s everyday behavior. Current research in CL applied to the HAR domain is still under-explored with researchers exploring existing methods developed for computer vision in HAR. Moreover, analysis has so far focused on task-incremental or class-incremental learning paradigms where task boundaries are known. This impedes the applicability of such methods for real-world systems. To push this field forward, we build on recent advances in the area of continual learning and design a lifelong adaptive learning framework using Prototypical Networks, LAPNet-HAR, that processes sensor-based data streams in a task-free data-incremental fashion and mitigates catastrophic forgetting using experience replay and continual prototype adaptation. Online learning is further facilitated using contrastive loss to enforce inter-class separation. LAPNet-HAR is evaluated on five publicly available activity datasets in terms of its ability to acquire new information while preserving previous knowledge. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of LAPNet-HAR in task-free CL and uncover useful insights for future challenges.",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;Future changes in the wind wave climate due to atmospheric changes can intensify present erosion and flood risk. Knowledge on both mean and extreme wave climate is necessary for understanding changes in sediment dynamics and flood events at the coastline. In order to assess potential wave changes, ensemble nearshore wave projections are required for covering &amp;#160;&amp;#160;the entire range of wave conditions and also the large uncertainties related to future climate states. However, nearshore wave projections are not available for most coastal regions due to the excessive computational effort required for dynamically downscaling ensemble offshore wave data. As a result, the large relative contribution of waves to coastal flooding and erosion is commonly omitted in the assessment of those hazards. In this context, machine learning models can be an efficient tool for downscaling ensemble global wave projections if they are able to accurately simulate the non-linear processes of wave propagation due to their low computational requirements. Here, we analyse the performance of three machine learning methods, namely random forest, multivariate adaptive regression splines and artificial neural networks, for downscaling the wave climate along the coast of Florida. We further compare the performance of these three models to the multiple linear regression, which is a statistical model frequently used, although it does not account for the non-linearities associated with wave propagation processes. We find that the three machine learning models perform better than the multiple linear regression for all wave parameters (significant wave height, peak and mean periods, direction) along the entire coastline of Florida, which highlights the ability of these models to reproduce the non-linear wave propagation processes. Specifically, random forest shows the best performance and the lowest computational training times. In addition, this model shows a remarkably good performance in simulating the wave extreme events compared to the other models. By following a tree bagging approach, random forest can also provide confidence intervals and reduce the tuning process. The latter is one of the main disadvantages of the artificial neural networks, which also show a high performance for wave downscaling but require more training and tuning effort. Although the significant wave height and the periods can be simulated with very high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; higher than 0.9 and 0.8 respectively), the wave direction is poorly simulated by all models due to its circular behaviour. We find that a transformation of the direction into sine and cosine can improve the model performance. Finally, we downscale an ensemble of global wave projections along the coast of Florida and assess potential changes in the wave climate of this region. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

The dataset was preprocessed and user_verified column played a vital\nrole. Multiple machine algorithms were then performed on the extracted features\nfrom preprocessed dataset. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine had\npromising results with both above 92% accuracy. Naive Bayes and Long-Short Term\nmemory didn't achieve desired accuracies. The model can also be applied to\nimages and videos for better detection of fake news.",

        "abstract": "With the recent legalization of cannabis in Canada on October 17, 2018, the opportunity for emerging tech to complement and improve the cannabis experience is vast. The legalization of an industry that has been operating in the dark for decades means ample newfound opportunity for government and corporate-funded collaboration, development and research. A specific area of opportunity for growth within the cannabis sector is through personalization. Personalization is often performed via artificial intelligence—specifically machine learning—to develop a customized experience for users on various platforms. This is usually with the intention of targeted marketing. And while mass data collection serves the user by streamlining content to their assumed preferences, which then often directs them to businesses and products, product-tailoring still has vast potential for growth. Though a medical document for cannabis from a health practitioner may include broadband components to look out for, like “THC” and “CBD”, or even suggest ratios of those cannabinoids there is typically no specification on strain type and best consumption methods.\nBecause the effects that cannabis has on a user varies from individual to individual and is dependent on not only their biometrics, but the various other terpenes and cannabinoids that exist in each strain beyond THC and CBD, cannabis users are missing out on opportunities to make the most of their use. Especially for those interested in cannabis to relieve specific symptoms, testing the vast amount of strains that exist and being able to identify the ideal product would be an arduous task on one’s own.\nJibed is an app that would use the aggregation of user data to prescribe the most suitable strain of cannabis for that individual based on their specific conditions and body metrics. As the majority of the target audience (cannabis users in Canada) are already logged on to a multitude of data collecting apps (music, health, social, etc.), there is no shortage of data. The app would consider all the implications of the data, from one’s health to mood deduced from the music they're listening to -- just to name some -- in order to achieve optimal prescriptions.",

        "authors": "Randa Natras, Michael Schmidt",
        "published": "No Date",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The accuracy and reliability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications are affected by the state of the Earth&amp;#8216;s ionosphere, especially when using single frequency observations, which are employed mostly in mass-market GNSS receivers. In addition, space weather can be the cause of strong sudden disturbances in the ionosphere, representing a major risk for GNSS performance and reliability. Accurate corrections of ionospheric effects and early warning information in the presence of space weather are therefore crucial for GNSS applications. This correction information can be obtained by employing a model that describes the complex relation of space weather processes with the non-linear spatial and temporal variability of the Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) within the ionosphere and includes a forecast component considering space weather events to provide an early warning system. To develop such a model is challenging but an important task and of high interest for the GNSS community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model the impact of space weather, a complex chain of physical dynamical processes between the Sun, the interplanetary magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field and the ionosphere need to be taken into account. Machine learning techniques are suitable in finding patterns and relationships from historical data to solve problems that are too complex for a traditional approach requiring an extensive set of rules (equations) or for which there is no acceptable solution available yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main objective of this study is to develop a model for forecasting the ionospheric VTEC taking into account physical processes and utilizing state-of-art machine learning techniques to learn complex non-linear relationships from the data. In this work, supervised learning is applied to forecast VTEC. This means that the model is provided by a set of (input) variables that have some influence on the VTEC forecast (output). To be more specific, data of solar activity, solar wind, interplanetary and geomagnetic field and other information connected to the VTEC variability are used as input to predict VTEC values in the future. Different machine learning algorithms are applied, such as decision tree regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting. The decision trees are the simplest and easiest to interpret machine learning algorithms, but the forecasted VTEC lacks smoothness. On the other hand, random forest and gradient boosting use a combination of multiple regression trees, which lead to improvements in the prediction accuracy and smoothness. However, the results show that the overall performance of the algorithms, measured by the root mean square error, does not differ much from each other and improves when the data are well prepared, i.e. cleaned and transformed to remove trends. Preliminary results of this study will be presented including the methodology, goals, challenges and perspectives of developing the machine learning model.&lt;/p&gt;",

The underlying technologies of PEBBLES (Providing Education by Bringing Learning Environments to Students) were incorporated into the High School PEBBLES Prototype (HSPP) with new functionality such as application sharing and a whiteboard. Laboratory studies were conducted with four groups of high school students in a simulated classroom/hospital environment, assigning them a storyboarding task that encouraged use of the prototype's videoconferencing and application sharing features. The results indicated that the students could work collaboratively through the HSPP, and the students were able to experience presence. Some of the critical requirements for effective presence through videoconferencing were identified. The systems development approach used in this thesis highlights the value of intelligent modeling of systems in order to meet the specific requirements of the users.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHuman-machine interfaces contribute to the improvement of the life quality of physically disabled users. In this study, a non-invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) design methodology was proposed to control a robot arm through magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on directionally modulated MEG activity that was acquired during the user’s imagined wrist movements in four various directions. The partial directed coherence (PDC) measure derived from functional connectivity between cortical brain regions was utilized in the feature extraction process. The time-varying parameters were estimated based on a time-varying multivariate adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model, that can detect task-dependent features and non-symmetric channel relevance for mental task discrimination. An extreme learning machine (ELM), that utilizes Moore-Penrose (MP) generalized inverse to set its weights and does not necessitate a gradient-based backpropagation algorithm was employed to generate a model with the extracted feature set. The output of the task classification model was embedded into the robotic arm model for realizing control-based tasks. The classification results dictate that the proposed BMI methodology is a feasible solution for rehabilitation or assistance systems that are devised to help motor-impaired people. The proposed methodology provides very satisfactory classification performance at a fast learning speed.",

        "abstract": "New parents are frequently awakened by the cries of their newborn babies. Attempts to stop these cries sometimes result in increasingly louder cries. By first transforming these cries into waveforms, and then into sound spectrograms, the efficiencies and accuracies of different computer learning modules were tested: a support vector machine, a 2-layer neural network, and a long short-term memory model. Finally, an automatic sorter that categorizes each cry was developed. Using this method, it is possible to eliminate error and time wastage when trying to calm a baby. The results of testing the programs demonstrate a high accuracy rate for determining the source of a baby’s cries. This program will enable parents to calm their crying babies in a shorter amount of time, giving them more peace of mind, and perhaps allowing them to get more sleep.",

Firstly, the RGB color information of each pixel in the color image is represented by quaternion based on the relevant knowledge of computational mathematics, and the color image pixel is processed as a whole vector to maintain the relevant information between the three color channels. Secondly, the dictionary represented by quaternion and the sparse coefficient represented by quaternion are obtained by using the our proposed sparse representation model. Thirdly, the coefficient fusion is carried out by using the “max-L1” rule. Finally, the fused sparse coefficient and dictionary are used for image reconstruction to obtain the quaternion fused image, which is then converted into RGB color multi-focus fused image. Our method belongs to computational mathematics, and uses the relevant knowledge in the field of computational mathematics to help us carry out the experiment. The experimental results show that the method has achieved good results in visual quality and objective evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Prostate Low-Dose-Rate brachytherapy (LDR) is one of the most effective treatments for localized prostate cancer. Machine Learning (ML), the application of statistics to complex computational problem solving, was applied to prostate LDR brachytherapy treatment planning. Planning time, pre-implant dosimetry, and various measures of clinical implant quality for ML plans were compared against plans created by expert brachytherapists.\nThe average planning time to create an ML plan was 0.84 _ 0.57 min compared to over 17.88 _ 8.76 min for an experienced brachytherapists. Dosimetry was not significantly different for ML and expert brachytherapist plans. Clinical implant quality for the ML plans were ranked as nearly equivalent to the brachytherapist treatment plans in all qualitative categories evaluated.\nThe results of this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to generate high quality prostate brachytherapy treatment plans with comparable quality to those of a human expert using a custom ML algorithm.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Asteroid families are groups of asteroids that are the product of collisions or of the rotational fission of a parent object. &amp;#160;These groups are mainly identified in proper elements or frequencies domains. &amp;#160; Because of robotic telescope surveys, the number of known asteroids has increased from about 10,000 in the early 90's to more than 750,000 nowadays. Traditional approaches for identifying new members of asteroid families, like the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), may &amp;#160; struggle to keep up with the growing rate of new discoveries. Here we used machine learning classification algorithms to identify new family members based on the orbital distribution in proper (a,e,sin(i)) of previously known family constituents. We compared the outcome of nine classification algorithms from stand alone and ensemble approaches. &amp;#160;The Extremely Randomized Trees (ExtraTree) method had the highest precision, enabling to&amp;#160; retrieve up to 97% of family members identified with standard HCM.&lt;/p&gt;",

Structural classification is the area of research that this thesis focuses on. We use visualizations of proteins to build a machine learning class prediction model, that successfully classifies proteins using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) framework. SCOP is a well-researched classification with many approaches using a representation of a proteins secondary structure in a linear chain of structures. This thesis uses a novel approach of rendering a three dimensional visualization of the protein itself and then applying image based machine learning to determine a protein’s SCOP classification. The resulting convolutional neural network (CNN) method has achieved average accuracies in the range 78-87% on the 25PDB dataset, which is better than or equal to the existing methods.</p>",

        "abstract": "The ease with which mobile money is used to facilitate cross-border payments presents a global threat to law enforcement in the fight against laundering and terrorist financing. This paper aims to use machine learning classifiers to predict transactions flagged as fraud in mobile money transfers. Data for this paper came from real-time transactions that stimulate a well-known mobile transfer fraud scheme. This paper uses logistic regression as the baseline model and compares it with ensembles and gradient descent models. The results indicate that the established logistic regression model did not perform too poorly compared to the other models. The random forest classifier had the most outstanding performance among all measures. The amount of money transferred was the top feature to predict money laundering transactions through mobile money transfers. These findings suggest that more research is needed to improve the logistic regression model. The random forest classifier should be further explored as a potential tool for law enforcement and financial institutions to detect money laundering activities in mobile money transfers.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe telecom industry is going through a massive digital transformation with the adoption of ML, AI, feedback-based automation and advanced analytics to handle the next generation applications and services. AI concepts are not new; the algorithms used by Machine Learning and Deep Learning are being currently implemented in various industries and technology verticals. With growing data and immense volume of information over 5G, the ability to predict data proactively, swiftly and with accuracy, is critically important. Data-driven decision making will be vital in future communication networks due to the traffic explosion and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will accelerate the 5G network performance. Mobile operators are looking for a programmable solution that will allow them to accommodate multiple independent tenants on the same physical infrastructure and 5G networks allow for end-to-end network resource allocation using the concept of Network Slicing (NS). Network Slicing will play a vital role in enabling a multitude of 5G applications, use cases, and services. Network slicing functions will provide an end-to-end isolation between slices with an ability to customize each slice based on the service demands (bandwidth, coverage, security, latency, reliability, etc).",

        "abstract": "Every year, enormous project failure rates plague business companies across the globe, costing millions of dollars for each failed project. It is critical to understand the factors that influence project success. The goal of this study is to empirically discover the factors that lead to a successful project. This study used data from 469 projects to use three distinct supervised machine learning methods for classification: a) The Support Vector Machine (SVM), 2) The Probit regression, and 3) the Logistic regression. Five factors have been chosen.: Support from the top management, Technical skills, Client’s acceptance, Communication, and Monitoring. The findings of the SVM study revealed that SVM could accurately predict successful and unsuccessful projects. The findings of Logistic and Probit regression revealed that project success is more likely if project managers get appropriate top-level support and if the project team has sufficient technical capabilities. This study also discovered that good communication and control improve the odds of a project's success. However, according to the results of this research, client acceptability is a minor success factor for a project.",

This self-contained textbook introduces students and researchers of AI to the main mathematical techniques used to analyze machine learning algorithms, with motivations and applications. Topics covered include the analysis of supervised learning algorithms in the iid setting, the analysis of neural networks (e.g. neural tangent kernel and mean-field analysis), and the analysis of machine learning algorithms in the sequential decision setting (e.g. online learning, bandit problems, and reinforcement learning). Students will learn the basic mathematical tools used in the theoretical analysis of these machine learning problems and how to apply them to the analysis of various concrete algorithms. This textbook is perfect for readers who have some background knowledge of basic machine learning methods, but want to gain sufficient technical knowledge to understand research papers in theoretical machine learning.",

To reduce its negative effects, landslides prevention has become an urgent task, which includes investigating landslide-related information and predicting potential landslides. Machine learning is a state-of-the-art analytics tool that has been widely used in landslides prevention. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of relevant research on machine learning applied in landslides prevention, mainly focusing on (1) landslides detection based on images, (2) landslides susceptibility assessment, and (3) the development of landslide warning systems. Moreover, this paper discusses the current challenges and potential opportunities in the application of machine learning algorithms for landslides prevention.",

Many healthcare organizations are already working on developing their own home-centric data collection networks and intelligent big data analytics systems based on machine-learning principles. The benefit of using IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence for community and population health is better health outcomes for the population and communities. The new generation of machine-learning algorithms can use large standardized data sets generated in healthcare to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. A lot of these data come from sensors, devices, electronic health records (EHR), data generated by public health nurses, mobile data, social media, and the internet. This chapter shows a high-level implementation of a complete solution of IoT, big data, and machine learning implemented in the city of Cartagena, Colombia for hypertensive patients by using an eHealth sensor and Amazon Web Services components.",

Addition to this it includes a small description of naïve bayes classifier which used to be used through the authors. It explains the significance of training facts set and trying out information set in Machine mastering techniques. Machine learning nowadays becomes plenty used technique in the field of IT industry. It is a very effective instrument and technique for many quite a number fields such as education, IT and even in enterprise industry. In this paper, the researcher attempt to find computerized end result reputation of scholarships of college students by way of using naïve bayes classifier algorithm primarily based on the scholar educational performance, conversation skills, greedy power, IHS, income, time management, regularity etc. A scholarship offers a strength and self assurance to a student. It also boosts the performance of students indirectly. Usually scholarships are furnished by governments or authorities organizations. It is very essential for students to recognize their personal potentiality early in their educational profession so that they faster its growth, receiving attention from an employer or corporation helps college students take this step. Students can apply for scholarships primarily based on the eligibility criteria (such as caste category, annual income, etc). The scholarship will be issued based on merit, student performance and career specific. Different schemes of scholarships are provided for the students based on distinct eligibility criteria. By the use of a naïve bayes classifier, the researcher acquired a end result with accuracy of 96.7% and error of 3.3%. The repute of scholarship students was once displayed in the form of yes or no.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning methods are frequently used to detect behavioral and ecological data patterns. Even though these new mathematical methods are useful tools, the results are often ambivalent if we do not utilize biologically relevant parameters in the analyses. In our experiment, we analyzed whether the bout length of behavior elements could be a relevant parameter to determine the window length used by the machine learning method. We defined eight behavior elements and collected motion data with a smartwatch attached to the dog’s collar. The behavior sequences of 56 freely moving dogs from various breeds were analyzed by deploying a specific software (SensDog). The behavior recognition was based on binary classification that was evaluated with a Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) learning algorithm, a boosted decision-tree-based method with a 3-fold cross-validation. We used the sliding window technique during the signal processing, and we aimed at finding the best window size for the analysis of each behavior element to achieve the most effective settings. Our results showed that in the case of all behavior elements the best recognition with the highest AUC values was achieved when the window size corresponded to the median bout length of that particular behavior. In summary, the most effective strategy to improve significantly the accuracy of the recognition of behavioral elements is using behavior-specific parameters in the binary classification models, choosing behavior-specific window sizes (even when using the same ML model) and synchronizing the bout length of the behavior element with the time window length.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a world-wide trend has been observed that there is widespread adoption across all fields to embrace smart environments and automation. Smart environments include a wide variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, so many challenges face conventional digital forensic investigation (DFI) in such environments. These challenges include data heterogeneity, data distribution, and massive amounts of data, which exceed digital forensic (DF) investigators’ human capabilities to deal with all of these challenges within a short period of time. Furthermore, they significantly slow down or even incapacitate the conventional DFI process. With the increasing frequency of digital crimes, better and more sophisticated DFI procedures are desperately needed, particularly in such environments. Since machine-learning (ML) techniques might be a viable option in smart environments, this paper presents the integration of ML into DF, through reviewing the most recent papers concerned with the applications of ML in DF, specifically within smart environments. It also explores the potential further use of ML techniques in DF in smart environments to reduce the hard work of human beings, as well what to expect from future ML applications to the conventional DFI process.",

Researchers are trying their hard to fight against various genetic diseases like cancer. Artificial intelligence has empowered research in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the availability of opensource healthcare datasets has motivated the researchers to develop applications which can help in early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Further, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has helped to look into detailed intricacies of biological systems. It has provided an efficient and cost-effective approach with higher accuracy. The advent of microRNAs also known as small noncoding genes has begun the paradigm shift in oncological research. We are now able to profile expression profiles of RNAs using RNA-seq data. microRNA profiling has helped in uncovering their relationship in various genetic and biological processes. Here in this chapter, the authors present a review of the machine learning perspective in cancer research. ",

        "abstract": "Applying machine learning algorithms for encryption problems is reasonable in today's research connecting with cryptography. Using an encryption standard such as DES can give insight into how machine learning can help in breaking the encryption standards. The inspiration for this chapter is to use machine learning to reverse engineer hash functions. Hash functions are supposed to be tough to reverse one-way functions. The hash function will be learned by machine learning algorithm with a probability of more than 50%, which means the can develop their guesstimate of the reverse. This is concluded by executing the DES symmetric encryption function to generate N numerous values of DES with a set key and the machine learning algorithm is trained on a neural network to identify the first bit of the input based on the value of the function's output. Testing has ended through a new table, which was created similarly but with different inputs. The SVM runs on the new table, and it compares to the other table, and a confusion matrix is used to measure the excellence of the guesstimates.",

That paper focuses on exploratory data analysis and YOLOv3, you only look once at version three, a real-time recognizing model. The hypothesis of this research are, a cyber-attack gives the same pattern in all the different, different IP addresses, and the research model, the YOLOv3 model can detect the cyber-attack by seeing its pattern. First, the researcher collects more than one hundred seventy-eight thousand data from the cyber department of some companies. Then, the researcher does exploratory data analysis of that data in the jupyter notebook. Then, the researcher finds all the important information about cyber-attacks. Then, the researcher finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks from the information of the data collection. Then, the researcher collects pictures of the patterns. Then, with pictures of those patterns, the researcher labeled those pictures by labellmg software and create a zip file of them. Then the researcher use Google colab and trained, \"you only look once version three\", the YOLOv3 model to detect the name of the pattern. The machine can detect the pattern and can tell us about what cyber-attack it is by only seeing the picture of the pattern. The researcher finds the patterns for eight IP addresses and in all the IP addresses, the attacks give the same patterns. So, the hypothesis is true in all that cases. By this research model, we can easily know about any kind of cyber-attack in detail and also can find the cyber-attacks by their patterns. So, the researcher use jupyter notebook, Google Colab, and pycharm environment. Pattern study always plays an important role to know about anything. By knowing and learning about anything’s pattern, we can easily understand anything. This research does that thing greatly. The researcher first finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks, then make a model which can detect the cyber-attack by just seeing the pattern.",

        "abstract": "Every year, enormous project failure rates plague business companies across the globe, costing millions of dollars for each failed project. It is critical to understand the factors that influence project success. The goal of this study is to empirically discover the factors that lead to a successful project. This study used data from 469 projects to use three distinct supervised machine learning methods for classification: a) The Support Vector Machine (SVM), 2) The Probit regression, and 3) the Logistic regression. Five factors have been chosen.: Support from the top management, Technical skills, Client’s acceptance, Communication, and Monitoring. The findings of the SVM study revealed that SVM could accurately predict successful and unsuccessful projects. The findings of Logistic and Probit regression revealed that project success is more likely if project managers get appropriate top-level support and if the project team has sufficient technical capabilities. This study also discovered that good communication and control improve the odds of a project's success. However, according to the results of this research, client acceptability is a minor success factor for a project.",

This self-contained textbook introduces students and researchers of AI to the main mathematical techniques used to analyze machine learning algorithms, with motivations and applications. Topics covered include the analysis of supervised learning algorithms in the iid setting, the analysis of neural networks (e.g. neural tangent kernel and mean-field analysis), and the analysis of machine learning algorithms in the sequential decision setting (e.g. online learning, bandit problems, and reinforcement learning). Students will learn the basic mathematical tools used in the theoretical analysis of these machine learning problems and how to apply them to the analysis of various concrete algorithms. This textbook is perfect for readers who have some background knowledge of basic machine learning methods, but want to gain sufficient technical knowledge to understand research papers in theoretical machine learning.",

To reduce its negative effects, landslides prevention has become an urgent task, which includes investigating landslide-related information and predicting potential landslides. Machine learning is a state-of-the-art analytics tool that has been widely used in landslides prevention. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of relevant research on machine learning applied in landslides prevention, mainly focusing on (1) landslides detection based on images, (2) landslides susceptibility assessment, and (3) the development of landslide warning systems. Moreover, this paper discusses the current challenges and potential opportunities in the application of machine learning algorithms for landslides prevention.",

Many healthcare organizations are already working on developing their own home-centric data collection networks and intelligent big data analytics systems based on machine-learning principles. The benefit of using IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence for community and population health is better health outcomes for the population and communities. The new generation of machine-learning algorithms can use large standardized data sets generated in healthcare to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. A lot of these data come from sensors, devices, electronic health records (EHR), data generated by public health nurses, mobile data, social media, and the internet. This chapter shows a high-level implementation of a complete solution of IoT, big data, and machine learning implemented in the city of Cartagena, Colombia for hypertensive patients by using an eHealth sensor and Amazon Web Services components.",

Addition to this it includes a small description of naïve bayes classifier which used to be used through the authors. It explains the significance of training facts set and trying out information set in Machine mastering techniques. Machine learning nowadays becomes plenty used technique in the field of IT industry. It is a very effective instrument and technique for many quite a number fields such as education, IT and even in enterprise industry. In this paper, the researcher attempt to find computerized end result reputation of scholarships of college students by way of using naïve bayes classifier algorithm primarily based on the scholar educational performance, conversation skills, greedy power, IHS, income, time management, regularity etc. A scholarship offers a strength and self assurance to a student. It also boosts the performance of students indirectly. Usually scholarships are furnished by governments or authorities organizations. It is very essential for students to recognize their personal potentiality early in their educational profession so that they faster its growth, receiving attention from an employer or corporation helps college students take this step. Students can apply for scholarships primarily based on the eligibility criteria (such as caste category, annual income, etc). The scholarship will be issued based on merit, student performance and career specific. Different schemes of scholarships are provided for the students based on distinct eligibility criteria. By the use of a naïve bayes classifier, the researcher acquired a end result with accuracy of 96.7% and error of 3.3%. The repute of scholarship students was once displayed in the form of yes or no.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning methods are frequently used to detect behavioral and ecological data patterns. Even though these new mathematical methods are useful tools, the results are often ambivalent if we do not utilize biologically relevant parameters in the analyses. In our experiment, we analyzed whether the bout length of behavior elements could be a relevant parameter to determine the window length used by the machine learning method. We defined eight behavior elements and collected motion data with a smartwatch attached to the dog’s collar. The behavior sequences of 56 freely moving dogs from various breeds were analyzed by deploying a specific software (SensDog). The behavior recognition was based on binary classification that was evaluated with a Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) learning algorithm, a boosted decision-tree-based method with a 3-fold cross-validation. We used the sliding window technique during the signal processing, and we aimed at finding the best window size for the analysis of each behavior element to achieve the most effective settings. Our results showed that in the case of all behavior elements the best recognition with the highest AUC values was achieved when the window size corresponded to the median bout length of that particular behavior. In summary, the most effective strategy to improve significantly the accuracy of the recognition of behavioral elements is using behavior-specific parameters in the binary classification models, choosing behavior-specific window sizes (even when using the same ML model) and synchronizing the bout length of the behavior element with the time window length.",

        "abstract": "Recently, a world-wide trend has been observed that there is widespread adoption across all fields to embrace smart environments and automation. Smart environments include a wide variety of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, so many challenges face conventional digital forensic investigation (DFI) in such environments. These challenges include data heterogeneity, data distribution, and massive amounts of data, which exceed digital forensic (DF) investigators’ human capabilities to deal with all of these challenges within a short period of time. Furthermore, they significantly slow down or even incapacitate the conventional DFI process. With the increasing frequency of digital crimes, better and more sophisticated DFI procedures are desperately needed, particularly in such environments. Since machine-learning (ML) techniques might be a viable option in smart environments, this paper presents the integration of ML into DF, through reviewing the most recent papers concerned with the applications of ML in DF, specifically within smart environments. It also explores the potential further use of ML techniques in DF in smart environments to reduce the hard work of human beings, as well what to expect from future ML applications to the conventional DFI process.",

Researchers are trying their hard to fight against various genetic diseases like cancer. Artificial intelligence has empowered research in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the availability of opensource healthcare datasets has motivated the researchers to develop applications which can help in early diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Further, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has helped to look into detailed intricacies of biological systems. It has provided an efficient and cost-effective approach with higher accuracy. The advent of microRNAs also known as small noncoding genes has begun the paradigm shift in oncological research. We are now able to profile expression profiles of RNAs using RNA-seq data. microRNA profiling has helped in uncovering their relationship in various genetic and biological processes.

        "abstract": "Applying machine learning algorithms for encryption problems is reasonable in today's research connecting with cryptography. Using an encryption standard such as DES can give insight into how machine learning can help in breaking the encryption standards. The inspiration for this chapter is to use machine learning to reverse engineer hash functions. Hash functions are supposed to be tough to reverse one-way functions. The hash function will be learned by machine learning algorithm with a probability of more than 50%, which means the can develop their guesstimate of the reverse. This is concluded by executing the DES symmetric encryption function to generate N numerous values of DES with a set key and the machine learning algorithm is trained on a neural network to identify the first bit of the input based on the value of the function's output. Testing has ended through a new table, which was created similarly but with different inputs. The SVM runs on the new table, and it compares to the other table, and a confusion matrix is used to measure the excellence of the guesstimates.",

That paper focuses on exploratory data analysis and YOLOv3, you only look once at version three, a real-time recognizing model. The hypothesis of this research are, a cyber-attack gives the same pattern in all the different, different IP addresses, and the research model, the YOLOv3 model can detect the cyber-attack by seeing its pattern. First, the researcher collects more than one hundred seventy-eight thousand data from the cyber department of some companies. Then, the researcher does exploratory data analysis of that data in the jupyter notebook. Then, the researcher finds all the important information about cyber-attacks. Then, the researcher finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks from the information of the data collection. Then, the researcher collects pictures of the patterns. Then, with pictures of those patterns, the researcher labeled those pictures by labellmg software and create a zip file of them. Then the researcher use Google colab and trained, \"you only look once version three\", the YOLOv3 model to detect the name of the pattern. The machine can detect the pattern and can tell us about what cyber-attack it is by only seeing the picture of the pattern. The researcher finds the patterns for eight IP addresses and in all the IP addresses, the attacks give the same patterns. So, the hypothesis is true in all that cases. By this research model, we can easily know about any kind of cyber-attack in detail and also can find the cyber-attacks by their patterns. So, the researcher use jupyter notebook, Google Colab, and pycharm environment. Pattern study always plays an important role to know about anything. By knowing and learning about anything’s pattern, we can easily understand anything. This research does that thing greatly. The researcher first finds the patterns of some cyber-attacks, then make a model which can detect the cyber-attack by just seeing the pattern.",

In this study, a non-invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) design methodology was proposed to control a robot arm through magnetoencephalography (MEG) based on directionally modulated MEG activity that was acquired during the user’s imagined wrist movements in four various directions. The partial directed coherence (PDC) measure derived from functional connectivity between cortical brain regions was utilized in the feature extraction process. The time-varying parameters were estimated based on a time-varying multivariate adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model, that can detect task-dependent features and non-symmetric channel relevance for mental task discrimination. An extreme learning machine (ELM), that utilizes Moore-Penrose (MP) generalized inverse to set its weights and does not necessitate a gradient-based backpropagation algorithm was employed to generate a model with the extracted feature set. The output of the task classification model was embedded into the robotic arm model for realizing control-based tasks. The classification results dictate that the proposed BMI methodology is a feasible solution for rehabilitation or assistance systems that are devised to help motor-impaired people. The proposed methodology provides very satisfactory classification performance at a fast learning speed.",

        "abstract": "Software reliability is a statistical measure of how well software operates with respect to its requirements. There are two related software engineering research issues about reliability requirements. The first issue is achieving the necessary reliability, i.e., choosing and employing appropriate software engineering techniques in system design and implementation. The second issue is the assessment of reliability as a method of assurance that precedes system deployment. In past few years, various software reliability models have been introduced. These models have been developed in response to the need of software engineers, system engineers and managers to quantify the concept of software reliability. This chapter investigates performance of some classical and intelligent machine learning techniques such as Linear regression (LR), Radial basis function network (RBFN), Generalized regression neural network (GRNN), Support vector machine (SVM), to predict software reliability. The effectiveness of LR and machine learning methods is demonstrated with the help of sixteen datasets taken from Data & Analysis Centre for Software (DACS). Two performance measures, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is compared quantitatively obtained from rigorous experiments. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep-learning based natural language processing (NLP) models are proven vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, there is currently insufficient research that studies attacks to neural machine translations (NMTs) and examines the robustness of deep-learning based NMTs. In this paper, we aim to fill this critical research gap. When generating word-level adversarial examples in NLP attacks, there is a conventional trade-off in existing methods between the attacking performance and the amount of perturbations. Although some literature has studied such a trade-off and successfully generated adversarial examples with a reasonable amount of perturbations, it is still challenging to generate highly successful translation attacks while concealing the changes to the texts. To this end, we propose a novel Hybrid Attentive Attack method to locate language-specific and sequence-focused words, and make semantic-aware substitutions to attack NMTs. We evaluate the effectiveness of our attack strategy by attacking three high-performing translation models. The experimental results show that our method achieves the highest attacking performance compared with other existing attacking strategies.",
