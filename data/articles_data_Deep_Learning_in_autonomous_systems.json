        "abstract": "Real-time route tracking is an important research topic for autonomous vehicles used in industrial facilities. Traditional methods such as copper line tracking on the ground, wireless guidance systems, and laser systems are still used in route tracking. In this study, a deep-learning-based floor path model for route tracking of autonomous vehicles is proposed. A deep-learning floor path model and algorithm have been developed for highly accurate route tracking, which avoids collisions of vehicles and follows the shortest route to reach the destination. The floor path model consists of markers. Routes in the floor path model are created by using these markers. The floor path model is transmitted to autonomous vehicles as a vector by a central server. The server dispatches the target marker address to the vehicle to move. The vehicle calculates all possible routes to this address and chooses the shortest one. Marker images on the selected route are processed using image processing and classified with a pre-trained deep-CNN model. If the classified image and the image on the selected route are the same, the vehicle proceeds toward its destination. While the vehicle moves on the route, it sends the last classified marker to the server. Other autonomous vehicles use this marker to determine the location of this vehicle. Other vehicles on the route wait to avoid a collision. As a result of the experimental studies we have carried out, the route tracking of the vehicles has been successfully achieved.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving\nusing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving\ndatasets. Unlike existing techniques, our proposed technique takes the learning loss into\naccount under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. We apply DRL to object\ndetection and safe navigation while enhancing a self-driving vehicle’s ability to discern meaningful information from surrounding data. For efficient environmental perception and object\ndetection, various Q-learning based methods have been proposed in the literature. Unlike\nother works, this thesis proposes a collaborative deterministic as well as stochastic policy\ngradient based on DRL. Our technique is a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE),\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC) that adequately\ntrains a self-driving vehicle. In this work, we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe\nautonomous driving without colliding with an obstacle or steering off the track. We propose\na collaborative framework that utilizes best features of VAE, DDPG, and SAC and models\nautonomous driving as partly stochastic and partly deterministic policy gradient problem in\ncontinuous action space, and continuous state space. To ensure that the vehicle traverses the\nroad over a considerable period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a\nhigher negative penalty is associated with an unfavourable action and a comparatively lower\npositive reward is awarded for favourable actions. We also examine the variations in policy\nloss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for ‘VAE+DDPG’ and ‘VAE+SAC’\nover the learning process.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving\nusing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving\ndatasets. Unlike existing techniques, our proposed technique takes the learning loss into\naccount under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. We apply DRL to object\ndetection and safe navigation while enhancing a self-driving vehicle’s ability to discern meaningful information from surrounding data. For efficient environmental perception and object\ndetection, various Q-learning based methods have been proposed in the literature. Unlike\nother works, this thesis proposes a collaborative deterministic as well as stochastic policy\ngradient based on DRL. Our technique is a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE),\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC) that adequately\ntrains a self-driving vehicle. In this work, we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe\nautonomous driving without colliding with an obstacle or steering off the track. We propose\na collaborative framework that utilizes best features of VAE, DDPG, and SAC and models\nautonomous driving as partly stochastic and partly deterministic policy gradient problem in\ncontinuous action space, and continuous state space. To ensure that the vehicle traverses the\nroad over a considerable period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a\nhigher negative penalty is associated with an unfavourable action and a comparatively lower\npositive reward is awarded for favourable actions. We also examine the variations in policy\nloss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for ‘VAE+DDPG’ and ‘VAE+SAC’\nover the learning process.",
