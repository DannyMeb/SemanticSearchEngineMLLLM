Such feedback is provided only after periods of actions in the form of reward or punishment without detailing which of the actions has contributed to the outcome. This type of learning scenario is called reinforcement learning. This learning problem is formalized in a Markov decision-making process with a variety of related algorithms. The second part of this chapter will use function approximators with neural networks which have made recent progress as deep reinforcement learning.",

The focus of this research is understanding the interaction of identity, emotion, and belonging within the context of my own adult learning experience. The central emphasis seeks to offer contributing factors to adult learning in a context outside of formal learning opportunities, such as in university or school-based learning. I employed the reflexive process of autoethnography through journal entries, photographic documentation, and recalling to examine my own experience of learning in a non-academic setting. Various theories of self-identity, participation, and learning were explored to frame my own learning experience. This methodological approach allowed the pursuit of adult learning to emerge as something deeply intertwined with an individual’s understanding of their identity, affective experiences, and sense of belonging. These considerations have capacity to further current conceptualizations of the process of adult learning experiences. Implications for facilitators of adult learning are offered. ",

It centers on how the women were recreating conditions of normalcy while adapting to the space. During even their first moments in prison, when they did not know the space or the capacity of their bodies to function under extreme conditions, women prisoners had to learn how to transform their cells into safe places to regroup and gather strength. Some women used their bodies to achieve social visibility as women. They also used their bodies to liberate themselves from the limitations prescribed by their physicality, for example, through a hunger strike, fasting, or suicide. Throughout this adaptation process, the body was becoming a site of transformation and emancipation from the state of being merely a prisoner.",

        "abstract": "Very few organizations have ever been able to achieve their goal of becoming a learning organization due to the complexity of organizational learning and the impatience and lack of skills of organizational leaders. Over the past twenty-five years, the author of this chapter has discovered that the introduction of action learning programs into the organization is the most effective way of building a learning organization. This chapter briefly summarizes the five subsystems of a learning organization: (1) learning, (2) organization, (3) people, (4) knowledge, and (5) technology. Action learning is a powerful tool that enables a group to learn while in action. It has the unique ability to solve complex problems while simultaneously creating leaders, building teams, and developing each of the five learning organization subsystems.",

        "abstract": "Educators, students, and parents often speak about the environment or climate of classrooms and schools because they consider it important in its own right and influential for achieving various educational goals. However, it is rare for educators to include the learning environment in their evaluation procedures, whereas they focus almost exclusively on narrow achievement criteria. Although the learning environment is a subtle concept, the literature cited in this article charts remarkable progress since the 1960s in conceptualizing, assessing, researching, and changing it. Progress and internationalization in the field of learning environment over the past several decades has been facilitated considerably by Learning Environments Research: An International Journal, which began in 1998 and remains the only journal devoted exclusively to this topic. Following a section covering important reviews/overviews of the field, this article is divided into four significant topics that dominate the literature on learning environments. First, the field is rich in terms of economical, valid, and widely used instruments for assessing learning environments. Second, learning-environment assessments frequently have been used as criteria of effectiveness in the evaluation of educational programs and instructional methods, with indicators of classroom climate often differentiating revealingly between educational alternatives even when a variety of outcome measures do not. Third, the most common line of past learning-environment research has been relationships between the learning environment and student outcomes, which consistently suggests that creating positive classroom/school climates improves student outcomes. Fourth, educators have found it useful to use feedback based on their students’ perceptions of actual and preferred climate in action research aimed at improving learning environments.",

It focuses on the basic elements of these techniques that seem particularly useful for asset pricing and looks at the material on some of those methods in more detail by reviewing asset pricing applications. Supervised learning methods can be grouped into two categories: classification and regression methods. The chapter explains that classification methods are used in settings where the dependent variable y is categorial, while regression methods deal with continuous dependent variables. In asset pricing applications, regression problems are more common, although classification methods can also be useful, for example for prediction of binary events like a corporate default.",

        "abstract": " Service learning is a pedagogical approach that engages youth in achieving learning goals that link communities and schools through intentional, structured activities (McReynolds, 2015). Through service learning, the practitioner engages students in projects that serve the community while building social, civic, and academic skills to help them learn about others. Critical service learning, on the other hand, builds on service learning and expands to include social justice principles. Critical service learning as an approach compels youth to interrogate systems and structures of inequality and distribution of power and to seek to develop authentic relationships among all participants (Mitchell, 2008). It also encourages participants to examine issues of power, privilege, and oppression within the service activity by questioning hidden biases and assumptions concerning race, class, and gender and to challenge the status quo by working toward changing inequities within social and economic systems (Cipolle, 2010). Engaging in critical service learning, as a therapeutic strategy, allows youth to con¬template community problem- solving through critical thinking that raises questions about the roots of social inequality. For example, youth who embark on service learning may develop a wellness project that considers the effect of health on mood and behavior. Students may incorporate simple physical exercises and healthy eating tips and create a nutritional food menu for students to share with their peers and families. Students who participate in this same example from a critical service learning framework not only will do all of these activities but also will critically analyze factors that contribute to healthy living. For example, students may explore the barriers to accessing fresh fruits and vegetables in communities that are food deserts (communities with a scarcity of mainstream markets that have fresh fruits and vegetables). Students may delve further to consider the economic and political decisions that reduce access to healthy foods in their neighborhoods. Students may perform action research through facilitating a shopping field trip to neighborhood, and mainstream food outlets to inspect and compare the produce for quality and price value. As a result, students may bring their findings to their local political office to request sup¬port to improve local food outlet resources. ",

From there his work with Ulster College, Belfast and the General Electric Company’s “Developing Senior Management” programs led to the publication of The Learning Organization, thought to be the first book in this area of study. This led to his growing interest in the lack of learning and development of boards of directors and to the publication of his Learning Board model in The Fish Rots from the Head. His work has been influential in developing business and organizational learning in China, South Africa, South East Asia, Australia and the Caribbean, as well as Europe.",

While many of these approaches outline in some detail the organizational conditions considered beneficial for learning, the specific nature of that learning is often less precisely defined. The purpose of this chapter is to review three main approaches to the learning organization and focus on their conceptualizations of learning. By tracing the genealogy of these conceptualizations in the broader learning literature, common antecedents can be found mainly in the work of Argyris and Schön and to some degree in the work of Revans.",

This chapter revisits Senge’s learning organization by looking at how the idea has been conceptualized since its publication. Consequently, it aims to further develop a more holistic model of Senge’s learning organization philosophy that can enable systematic evaluation of the process of creating a learning organization. In detail, it attempts to develop all possible antecedents for the five disciplines of a learning organization, namely personal mastery, mental models, team learning, shared vision, and systems thinking mainly based on what has been developed in the literature so far. This conceptual framework is expected to assist both practitioners and researchers in building learning organizations.",

In particular, it demonstrates how to apply three important machine learning algorithms, a support vector classifier (SVC), a random forest classifier (RFC), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). While many of the methods studied later go beyond these now classic methods, this does not mean that these methods are obsolete. Also, the algorithms discussed here provide some form of baseline to discuss advanced methods like probabilistic reasoning and deep learning. The aim here is to demonstrate that applying machine learning methods based on machine learning libraries is not very difficult. It offers an opportunity to discuss evaluation techniques that are very important in practice.",

The argument is abductive. It draws on philosophical introspection spanning several hundred years, evidence from psychology, and evidence from neuroscience. The argument is that when we look at these three different levels of analysis, the best overall explanation for their results is that perceptual learning occurs, is fairly widespread, and is genuinely perceptual rather than post-perceptual. One key piece of the argument is that neuroscientific perceptual learning experiments repeatedly show that there are changes very early on in the primary sensory cortices after perceptual learning tasks. Coupled with behavioral evidence from psychology and convergent philosophical introspection on the perceptual learning cases, this chapter argues that perceptual learning is genuinely perceptual, rather than post-perceptual.",

        "abstract": "Lifelong learning requires the ability to learn from life experiences. This chapter describes the theory of experiential learning, whereby knowledge is generated from experience through a cycle of learning driven by the resolution of dual dialectics of action/reflection and experience/abstraction. The chapter provides an overview of stylistic preferences that arise from patterns of choosing among these modes of learning, as well as the spaces in which learning occurs. Movement through these modes and spaces links one experience to the next, creating a learning spiral that guides growth and development through a lifetime. Lifelong learning is also shaped by an individual’s learning identity, the extent to which one believes he or she can learn, and learning relationships, connections that promote movement through the learning spiral. Strategies for enhancing the learning process are provided for each of these topics.",
