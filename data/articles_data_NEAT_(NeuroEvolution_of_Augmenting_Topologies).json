        "abstract": " The development of computational methods to accurately model three-dimensional protein structures from sequences of amino acid residues is becoming increasingly important to the structural biology field. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the tertiary structure of a given amino acid sequence, which has been reported to belong to the NP-Complete class of problems. We present a new method, namely NEAT–FLEX, based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to extract structural features from (ABS) proteins that are determined experimentally. The proposed method manipulates structural information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and predicts the conformational flexibility (FLEX) of residues of a target amino acid sequence. This information may be used in three-dimensional structure prediction approaches as a way to reduce the conformational search space. The proposed method was tested with 24 different amino acid sequences. Evolving neural networks were compared against a traditional error back-propagation algorithm; results show that the proposed method is a powerful way to extract and represent structural information from protein molecules that are determined experimentally.

The actual problem of improving the technology of the IOT is counteracting malicious network impacts. In this regard, research and development aimed at creating effective tools for solving applied problems within the framework of this problem are becoming increasingly important.  This study seeks to develop tools for detecting anomalous network conditions resulting from malicious attacks. In particular, the accuracy of the identification of DoS and DDoS attacks is sufficient for operational use. This study analyzes various multi-level architectures, relevant communication protocols, and different types of network attacks. The presented research was conducted on open datasets TON_IOT DATASETS, which include multiple data sources collected from IoT sensors. The modified HyperNEAT algorithm was used as the basis for the development. The NEAT methodology used in the study allows you to combine various network nodes. Results of the study: a neuro-evolutionary algorithm for identifying DoS and DDoS attacks was implemented, integrated, and real-tested based on a multi-level analysis of network traffic combined with various adaptive modules. The accuracy of identifying DoS and DDoS attacks is 0.9242 in the Accuracy metric. The study implies that the proposed approach can be recommended for network intrusion detection, ensuring security when interacting with the IoT.",

To estimate the total tree height (Ht), the RNAs and the regression model, we used as variables a diameter of 1.3 m height (dbh) and the dominant height (Hd). The RNAs were adjusted and applied to the computer system NeuroForest, varying the size of the initial population (the genetic algorithm parameter) and the density of initial connections. Estimates of the total height of the trees obtained with the use of RNA and the regression model were evaluated based on the correlation coefficient, the percentage of errors scatter plot, the percentage frequency histogram of percentage errors, and the root mean square error (root mean square error - RMSE). Various settings which resulted in superior statistics to the hypsometric regression model were found. Connections had the highest correlation and the lowest RMSE% with a population size value of 300 and an initial density of 0.1 RNA. The NEAT methodology proved effective in estimating the height of trees in clonal population of eucalyptus.",

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is considered one of the most influential algorithms in the field. Eighteen years after its invention, a plethora of methods have been proposed that extend NEAT in different aspects. In this article, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) to list and categorize the methods succeeding NEAT. Our review protocol identified 232 papers by merging the findings of two major electronic databases. Applying criteria that determine the paper's relevance and assess its quality, resulted in 61 methods that are presented in this article. Our review article proposes a new categorization scheme of NEAT's successors into three clusters. NEAT-based methods are categorized based on 1) whether they consider issues specific to the search space or the fitness landscape, 2) whether they combine principles from NE and another domain, or 3) the particular properties of the evolved ANNs. The clustering supports researchers 1) understanding the current state of the art that will enable them, 2) exploring new research directions or 3) benchmarking their proposed method to the state of the art, if they are interested in comparing, and 4) positioning themselves in the domain or 5) selecting a method that is most appropriate for their problem.",

This paper proposes the novel distributed implementation of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies method, which considering availability of sufficient computational resources allows drastically speed up the process of optimal neural network configuration search. Batch genome evaluation was implemented for the means of proposed solution performance optimization, fair, and even computational resources usage.

Laser power, welding speed, scanning frequency, and scanning amplitude are set as the input parameters of the model, and welding depth (WD) as the output parameter of the model.

Moreover, the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of the welding depth is about 6.2%.

The morphologies of the creatures are established using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method based on the distance metrics fitness function. The concept of damaging crossover of neural networks and genetic language for the morphology of creatures has been considered in the morphologies of the artificial creature. Creatures with certain morphological traits consume a large time to optimize their kinetics, thus they are placed in a separate species to limit the search. The simulation results in the significant kinetics of artificial creatures (2-5 limbs) in virtual mediums with varying dynamic and static coefficients of friction (0.0-4.0). The motion of artificial creatures in the simulated medium was determined at different angles and demonstrated in the 3D space.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes in Indonesia has been perceived as a grave health problem and has been a concern since the early 1980â€™s [2]. The prevalence of diabetes in adults in Indonesia, as stated by IDF, was 6.2% with the total case amounting to 10.681.400. Moreover, Indonesia is also in the top ten global countries with the highest diabetes case in 2013. This research will investigate the role of Deep Belief Network (DBN) and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topology (NEAT) in solving regression problems in detecting diabetes. DBN works by processing the data in unsupervised network architectures. The algorithm puts Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) into a stacked process. The output of the first RBM will be the input for the next RBM. On the other hand, the NEAT algorithm works by investigating the neural network architecture and evaluating the architecture using a multi-layer perceptron algorithm. Collaboration with a Genetic Algorithm in NEAT is the key process in architecture development. The research results showed thatÂ DBN could be utilized as the initial weight for Backpropagation Neural Network at 22.61% on average. On the other hand, the NEAT algorithm could be used by collaborating with a multi-layer perceptron to solve this regression problem by providing 74.5% confidence. This work also reveals potential works in the future by combining the Backpropagation algorithm with NEAT as an evaluation function and by combining it with DBN algorithms to process the produced initial weight.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel search operation is proposed for the neuroevolution of augmented topologies, namely the difference-based mutation. This operator uses the differences between individuals in the population to perform more efficient search for optimal weights and structure of the model. The difference is determined according to the innovation numbers assigned to each node and connection, allowing tracking the changes. The implemented neuroevolution algorithm allows backward connections and loops in the topology, and uses a set of mutation operators, including connections merging and deletion. The algorithm is tested on a set of classification problems and the rotary inverted pendulum control problem. The comparison is performed between the basic approach and modified versions. The sensitivity to parameter values is examined. The experimental results prove that the newly developed operator delivers significant improvements to the classification quality in several cases, and allow finding better control algorithms.",

The difference-based mutation changes the weights of the neural network by combining the weights of several other networks at the position of the connections having same innovation numbers. The implemented neuroevolution algorithm allows backward connections and loops in the topology, and uses several mutation operators, including connections deletion. The algorithm is tested on a set of classification problems and a rotary inverted pendulum problem and compared to the same approach without difference-based mutation. The experimental results show that the proposed weight tuning scheme allows significant improvements of classification quality in several cases and finding better control algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This chapter argues that Weil's overturning of Arendt's views is not limited to the judgment on Rome. The very Christianity that Arendt situates as the commencement of the drift toward the modern constitutes for Weil both its internal rampart and its principle source of contention simultaneously. Indeed, for Weil Christianity is the spiritual thread that allows modernity to continue advancing in light of its originary inspiration. This does not mean that the two interpretative horizons are openly contradictory. They even coincide at one point precisely in their severe judgment of historical Christianity, which, paradoxically, Weil blames for the de-Christianization of our times. However, their two perspectives diverge once again as Arendt observes that this phenomenon surely occurs because Christianity is lacking in mundane, public figures. In contrast, Weil believes that it is precisely Christianity's spirituality that makes it the unique, authentic “continuation” of Greece.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe structure and performance of neural networks are intimately connected, and by use of evolutionary algorithms, neural network structures optimally adapted to a given task can be explored. Guiding such neuroevolution with additional objectives related to network structure has been shown to improve performance in some cases, especially when modular neural networks are beneficial. However, apart from objectives aiming to make networks more modular, such structural objectives have not been widely explored. We propose two new structural objectives and test their ability to guide evolving neural networks on two problems which can benefit from decomposition into subtasks. The first structural objective guides evolution to align neural networks with a user-recommended decomposition pattern. Intuitively, this should be a powerful guiding target for problems where human users can easily identify a structure. The second structural objective guides evolution towards a population with a high diversity in decomposition patterns. This results in exploration of many different ways to decompose a problem, allowing evolution to find good decompositions faster. Tests on our target problems reveal that both methods perform well on a problem with a very clear and decomposable structure. However, on a problem where the optimal decomposition is less obvious, the structural diversity objective is found to outcompete other structural objectives—and this technique can even increase performance on problems without any decomposable structure at all.",
