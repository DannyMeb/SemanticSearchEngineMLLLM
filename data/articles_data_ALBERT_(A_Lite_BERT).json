        "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained language representation and its promising performance in various downstream applications have become an area of interest in the field of natural language processing (NLP). There has been huge interest in further increasing the model’s size in order to outperform the best previously obtained performances. However, at some point, increasing the model’s parameters may lead to reaching its saturation point due to the limited capacity of GPU/TPU. In addition to this, such models are mostly available in English or a shared multilingual structure. Hence, in this paper, we propose a lite BERT trained on a large corpus solely in the Romanian language, which we called “A Lite Romanian BERT (ALR-BERT)”. Based on comprehensive empirical results, ALR-BERT produces models that scale far better than the original Romanian BERT. Alongside presenting the performance on downstream tasks, we detail the analysis of the training process and its parameters. We also intend to distribute our code and model as an open source together with the downstream task.",

        "abstract": "The extensive generalization of these models can lead to overfitting, causing the model to perform poorly on unseen data and thereby not realizing its full potential. To address this challenge systematically, we propose a novel approach for lightweight and efficient fine-tuning of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that aims to achieve improved generalization and harness the maximum capabilities of BERT. Our proposed approach incorporates various regularization techniques designed to adaptively manage the model's complexity. We plan to conduct experiments using this approach across various NLP tasks, including GLUE (Wang et al., 2019), RACE (Lai et al., 2017), and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).",

By using data collected and formulated through an introspective method, it is found that the addressers commonly construct erotic riddles in odd interrogative sentence types intended to deceive and mislead the addressees. The riddled topics are mostly about human genital and everything related to it, woman's breasts, and sexual activity. The humorous riddle discourses are created by various riddling techniques, such as analogy and metaphor, homonymy, sound change, word and syllabic permutation, and metonymy. Javanese and Indonesian erotic riddle discourses often contain code-mixing of the two codes mastered almost equally well by the bilingual interlocutors living in bilingual and diglossic speech communities.",

Pragmatic linguistic studies are known as branches of linguistics which discuss the meaning of speech based on context. In this paper the context is understood as a conceptual framework about everything that is used as a reference in speaking or understanding speech. Context is classified into two types, namely linguistic and nonlinguistic. Linguistic contexts are contexts whose references are contained in previous speeches and nonlinguistic contexts are not found in speech or outside of language. The nonlinguistic context can be divided into four types, namely physical, psychological, social, and shared knowledge contexts.Keywords: Pragmatics, Context, Text, Meaning,Â Shared knowledge",

It also aims to find out the factors that influence the prohibition of speech based on the context of the conversation and categorized them into direct or indirect speech. The data of this research were taken from the utterance of the characters containing the directive speech acts of prohibition. The use of prohibition directive speech acts is analyzed based on the prohibition pattern in Japanese in accordance with the theory of Namatame. This type of research uses the qualitative descriptive research method with a pragmatic approach. From the results of data analysis it was found that the use of illocutionary speech forms directly prohibits,which are: the patterns of Â ~ V ru na, ~ te wa ikenai, ~ naide, ~ dame, and ~ janai. Ilocutionary forms are directly used by people who have strong authority over their partners. With his authority the speaker does not need to use indirect speech which usually emphasizes modesty.",

        "abstract": "This article explains the theory of speech acts proposed by John L. Austin and his student John R. Searle. Speech act theory is a sub-field of pragmatics. This field of study deals with the ways in which words can be used not only to present information but also to carry out actions. This theory considers three levels or components of speech: locutionary acts (the making of a meaningful statement, saying something that a hearer understands), illocutionary acts (saying something with a purpose, such as to inform), and perlocutionary acts (saying something that causes someone to act). Many view speech acts as the central units of communication, with phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties of an utterance serving as ways of identifying the meaning of speakerâ€™s utterance or illocutionary force. There are fiveÂ types of IllocutionaryÂ point according to Searle: declarations, assertives, expressives, directives, and commissives (1979:viii). A speech act, in order to be successful, needs to be performed along certain types of conditions. These conditions were categorized by the linguist John Searle, who introduced the term felicity conditions: propositional content condition, preparatory condition, sincerity condition, and essential condition.",

The data is obtained through accessing the Netflix platform with a personal account. Found 123 data of expressive speech acts on the Bridgerton TV series subtitle with the functions of criticizing, praising, sarcastic, complaining, apologizing, condolences and thanks. The result of the research shows that there are two types of pragmatic equivalence that the Bridgerton TV series subtitle translator has successfully achieved in translating expressive speech acts. The equivalences are the equivalence of expressive illocutionary force and the equivalence of the distance of relevance. Thus, the translator has been able to convey messages from the source text to the target text commensurately.",

An interpretative method was conducted after the data were noted, listed, verified, and classified based on the kinds of meanings of reduplication as proposed by Wijana. The research findings show that the kinds of reduplication found in the geguritans can be classified into four: full reduplication, reduplication with sound modification, partial initial syllabic reduplication, and reduplication combined with affixation. In addition, only nine out of 12 categories of the meanings of reduplication were found in the data. The absence of the three categories is due to the difference between the language style used in geguritan and the language used in daily conversation.",

This e-module can be accessed anytime and anywhere with the gadget you have, both online and offline. The research method used is R & D from Sugiyono which consists of 10 stages. This study develops learning media in the form of e-modules for students and assesses the feasibility of media experts, material experts and students as users. The media expert's assessment resulted in 92.85, from material experts 95.31 and small group students 90.5 while the large group was 88.74 which all showed very valid categories. This shows that the e-module is acceptable and appropriate to be given to students for the Financial Management course on Financial Literacy. ",

The objects of the research are the song lyrics and music video of Taylor Swift’s “The Man”. The research applies social semiotic analysis theoretical framework. The song lyric is analysed using the ideational metafunction of Halliday, while the music video using the representational meaning of Kress and Leeuwen’s Visual Grammar. The result shows that, in the lyrics, the portrayals of gender-based double standards mostly realized through the use of relational and material processes. The relational processes relates man with attributes such as “more of a boss”, “fearless leader”, “alpha type”, and “Leo”(Leonardo Di Caprio), while the material actualizes man’s action such as “play the field”, “hustled” and “put in the work”. Additionally, the Music Video is dominated by reactional processes that reveal people’s positive reaction towards man’s action and followed by symbolic attribute process that represents men in a more central, active and agentive manner and women in a marginal, passive, and object positions. Man is also portrayed as successful leader, greatest dad, rich man, while women are mostly seen laying down, wearing sexy attire and as object’s to man’s pleasure.",

This study uses a qualitative method with a psychological approach. The theory used in this research is the theory of life instinct and death instinct by Sigmund Freud. This study analyzes the style of language and characterizations to reveal the characters' mental conditions and inner conflict. The results of this study show that Hawthorne uses characterization techniques and figurative language to tell the conflict between the life and death instinct in Arthur Dimmesdale and Hester Prynne. Arthur Dimmesdale represents human weakness and hypocrisy that results in feelings of regret, inner conflict, and suffering that lead to the instinct of death. At the same time, the character Hester is described as having a strong and patient nature that leads to the instinct of life. This study concludes that Hawthorne uses characterization techniques and figurative language such as metaphor and simile to show the characters, Dimmesdale and Hester. They experience inner conflicts and life and death instincts.",

This research was data-driven study which focuses on idiomatic expressions found in an American novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn written by Mark Twain (1884/2018) as the Source Text (ST) and its Indonesian translation by Ambhita Dhyaningrum (2011) as the Target Text (TT). The data was analyzed by using descriptive (qualitative)-comparative methods focusing on Kvetko’s (2009) characteristics of idioms, Catford’s (1965) formal correspondence and textual equivalence, and Newmark’s (1981) semantic and communicative translation. The findings show that demotivated/opaque idioms, partially motivated idioms/semi opaque, and semi idioms are identified in the idioms. In addition, verba, verbless, and minimal pair idioms are found. Moreover, the translator tends to apply translation shifts which depart from formal correspondence to achieve the textual equivalence. Nevertheless, sometimes the translation shifts occur without resulting in the textual equivalence. The translator also applies communicative translation which is more natural in the target language.",

Coursera is an approved and famous online learning tool established by two professors from Stanford. According to previous studies, Coursera concentrates on duplicating knowledge instead of constructing it. The present work aims at observing Coursera community in its normal context and investigating how participants construct knowledge. The required data were gathered through archive data including the top and chosen posts of online discussion groups. The interaction analysis model (IAM) was used to qualitatively analyze the data. In the observed courses, it was found that Coursera is mostly at Phase I (sharing/comparing information) of the IAM. Using the IAM which was first proposed for investigations of online debates, the research found a new phase and operations for assessing the level of knowledge construction in online discussion forums. This research bridges the gaps in the related literature by providing a foundation for understanding knowledge construction in the xMOOC context. Besides, this research developed understanding for future work which is a Coursera community framework that generally makes a MOOC community more potential to construct knowledge.",

The results showed that in general they had favorable perceptions about the use of TikTok tutorial videos, but they reported three challenges: the speed, the backsounds and the instructions of the tutorial videos.

This study found that there were 53 registers in yoga exercises consisting of two forms, namely, single and complex. There are 29 singular forms and 24 complex forms. The yoga register also strongly influences Yogis (doers), including spirituality, attitudes, and  relationships with others. Also, it overcomes health problems faced daily which focus on meditation activities. Meanwhile, the meaning of register in the choice of speech style is intended by Acharya to inspire enthusiasm and freshness in communicating; besides that, it also marks a communication function that has the uniqueness of being a registered marker that has a specific meaning based on context.",
