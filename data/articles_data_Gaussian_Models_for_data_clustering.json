        "abstract": "AbstractRNA sequencing of time-course experiments results in three-way count data where the dimensions are the genes, the time points and the biological units. Clustering RNA-seq data allows to extract groups of co-expressed genes over time. After standardisation, the normalised counts of individual genes across time points and biological units have similar properties as compositional data. We propose the following procedure to suitably cluster three-way RNA-seq data: (1) pre-process the RNA-seq data by calculating the normalised expression profiles, (2) transform the data using the additive log ratio transform to map the composition in the D-part Aitchison simplex to a $$D-1$$\n\nD\n-\n1\n\n-dimensional Euclidean vector, (3) cluster the transformed RNA-seq data using matrix-variate Gaussian mixture models and (4) assess the quality of the overall cluster solution and of individual clusters based on cluster separation in the transformed space using density-based silhouette information and on compactness of the cluster in the original space using cluster maps as a suitable visualisation. The proposed procedure is illustrated on RNA-seq data from fission yeast and results are also compared to an analogous two-way approach after flattening out the biological units.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, most weather forecasting centers produce ensemble forecasts. &amp;#160;Ensemble forecasts provide information about probability distribution of the weather variables. They give a more complete description of the atmosphere than a unique run of the meteorological model. However, they may suffer from bias and under/over dispersion errors that need to be corrected. These distribution errors may depend on weather regimes. In this paper, we propose various extensions of the Gaussian mixture model and its associated inference tools for ensemble data sets. &amp;#160;The proposed models are then used to identify clusters which correspond to different types of distribution errors. Finally, a standard calibration method known as Non homogeneous Gaussian Regression (NGR) &amp;#160;is applied cluster by cluster in order to correct ensemble forecast distributions. It is shown that the proposed methodology is effective, interpretable and easy to use. &amp;#160;The clustering algorithms are illustrated on simulated and real data. The calibration method is applied to real data of temperature and wind medium range forecast for 3 stations in France.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to measure the expression patterns of individual cells and discover heterogeneity and functional diversity among cell populations. Due to variability, it is challenging to analyze such data efficiently. Many clustering methods have been developed using at least one free parameter. Different choices for free parameters may lead to substantially different visualizations and clusters. Tuning free parameters is also time consuming. Thus there is need for a simple, robust, and efficient clustering method. In this paper, we propose a new regularized Gaussian graphical clustering (RGGC) method for scRNA-seq data. RGGC is based on high-order (partial) correlations and subspace learning, and is robust over a wide-range of a regularized parameter λ. Therefore, we can simply set λ=2 or λ=log(p) for AIC (Akaike information criterion) or BIC (Bayesian information criterion) without cross-validation. Cell subpopulations are discovered by the Louvain community detection algorithm that determines the number of clusters automatically. There is no free parameter to be tuned with RGGC. When evaluated with simulated and benchmark scRNA-seq data sets against widely used methods, RGGC is computationally efficient and one of the top performers. It can detect inter-sample cell heterogeneity, when applied to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWe present an approach for efficiently training Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with non-stationary, high-dimensional streaming data. Our training scheme does not require data-driven parameter initialization (e.g., k-means) and can thus be trained based on a random initialization. Furthermore, the approach allows mini-batch sizes as low as 1, which are typical for streaming-data settings. Major problems in such settings are undesirable local optima during early training phases and numerical instabilities due to high data dimensionalities. We introduce an adaptive annealing procedure to address the first problem, whereas numerical instabilities are eliminated by using an exponential-free approximation to the standard GMM log-likelihood. Experiments on a variety of visual and non-visual benchmarks show that our SGD approach can be trained completely without, for instance, k-means based centroid initialization. It also compares favorably to an online variant of Expectation-Maximization (EM) – stochastic EM (sEM), which it outperforms by a large margin for very high-dimensional data.",

However, solving the CCCP is a challenging task due to its computational complexity. In this work, a strategy based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and dispersion reduction is presented to obtain the most likely locations of facilities for sets of client points considering their distribution patterns. Experiments performed on large CCCP instances, and considering updated best-known solutions, led to estimate the performance of the GMMs approach, termed as Dispersion Reduction GMMs, with a mean error gap smaller than 2.6%. This result is more competitive when compared to Variable Neighborhood Search, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and CKMeans and faster to achieve when compared to the best-known solutions obtained by Tabu-Search and Clustering Search.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough missing data are prevalent in applications, existing implementations of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) require complete data. Standard practice is to perform complete case analysis or imputation prior to model fitting. Both approaches have serious drawbacks, potentially resulting in biased and unstable parameter estimates. Here we present MGMM, an R package for fitting GMMs in the presence of missing data. Using three case studies on real and simulated data sets, we demonstrate that, when the underlying distribution is near-to a GMM, MGMM is more effective at recovering the true cluster assignments than state of the art imputation followed by standard GMM. Moreover, MGMM provides an accurate assessment of cluster assignment uncertainty even when the generative distribution is not a GMM. This assessment may be used to identify unassignable observations. MGMM is available as an R package on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MGMM.",

We explore various strategies to address this problem, including cost-sensitive learning, threshold adjustments, and sampling-based techniques.

Hence, in this paper, a new Geometry-Inference based Clustering heuristic is proposed for selecting the optimal numbers of clusters for kmeans of in other terms, the algorithm initialization. The conceptual approach proposes the “Initial speed rate” as the main geometric parameter to be statistically analysed. The distributions of this latter are then fitted using classical parametric probability distributions. The resulting fitted parameters show salient 2-stages linear behaviour according to the number of clusters within the kmeans process. Thus, the optimal number of clusters k* was assigned to the intersection of the 2 detected lines for all datasets adopted in this work. The benchmark analysis showed that the proposed heuristic is very competitive compared to other kmeans classical metrics.",

The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models cluster number with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal novel regulatory mechanisms.

We evaluate the performance of both methods on the basis of a simulation study and an empirical application, where we compare these approaches in terms of standard measures of estimation and time efficiency.

        "abstract": " Traditional clustering algorithms such as k-means and vanilla spectral clustering are known to deteriorate significantly in the presence of outliers. Several previous works in literature have proposed robust variants of these algorithms; however, they do not provide any theoretical guarantees. Extending previous clustering literature on Gaussian mixture models, in their paper “A Robust Spectral Clustering Algorithm for Sub-Gaussian Mixture Models with Outliers,” Prateek R. Srivastava, Purnamrita Sarkar, and Grani A. Hanasusanto developed a new spectral clustering algorithm and provided error bounds for the algorithm under a general sub-Gaussian mixture model setting with outliers. Surprisingly, their derived error bound matches with the best-known bound for semidefinite programs under the same setting without outliers. Numerical experiments on a variety of simulated and real-world data sets further demonstrate that their algorithm is less sensitive to outliers compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundBioinformatics investigators often gain insights by combining information across multiple and disparate data sets. Merging data from multiple sources frequently results in data sets that are incomplete or contain missing values. Although missing data are ubiquitous, existing implementations of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) either cannot accommodate missing data, or do so by imposing simplifying assumptions that limit the applicability of the model. In the presence of missing data, a standardad hocpractice is to perform complete case analysis or imputation prior to model fitting. Both approaches have serious drawbacks, potentially resulting in biased and unstable parameter estimates.ResultsHere we present missingness-aware Gaussian mixture models (), an package for fitting GMMs in the presence of missing data. Unlike existing GMM implementations that can accommodate missing data, places no restrictions on the form of the covariance matrix. Using three case studies on real and simulated’omicsdata sets, we demonstrate that, when the underlying data distribution is near-to a GMM, is more effective at recovering the true cluster assignments than either the existing GMM implementations that accommodate missing data, or fitting a standard GMM after state of the art imputation. Moreover, provides an accurate assessment of cluster assignment uncertainty, even when the generative distribution is not a GMM.ConclusionCompared to state-of-the-art competitors, demonstrates a better ability to recover the true cluster assignments for a wide variety of data sets and a large range of missingness rates. provides the bioinformatics community with a powerful, easy-to-use, and statistically sound tool for performing clustering and density estimation in the presence of missing data. is publicly available as an package on CRAN:https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MGMM.",

        "abstract": "GPS data is an interesting thing to research. Various studies have been conducted to find information based on GPS data. In this paper, we propose a novel model for determining the stopping point on a GPS data for cases of human movement without using transportation modes. Further, this information can be used to determines human behavior such as fraud and favorite spot. The GPS data used in this research is the travel data of the SUSENAS survey officers at the time of updating the census block for 27 households. Density Based Spatial Clustering Of Application With Noise (DBSCAN) And Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering model is used to create the model. The model made using a flowchart and applied to the GPS data that has been collected. The results of the developed model show that the stopping points generated using the DBSCAN cluster model are better than the stopping points generated using the GMM cluster model. Furthermore, the results of this study will be used to make model of surveyor fraud.",

        "abstract": "Molecular mechanics force fields require a chemical perception model to assign parameters to molecules. A recent advancement in force fields is the use of the SMARTS substructure query language as the perception model. Although it is straightforward to write SMARTS patterns to define new force field parameters, it is difficult to manually determine the particular patterns needed to improve performance. Here we present a scheme to automatically generate SMARTS patterns that partitions the data according to a given objective. From this operation we describe how hierarchies of SMARTS patterns can be generated from the input data. Such hierarchies can be used for building force fields from scratch or improve upon established ones. We test our methods by building SMARTS hierarchies that map SMARTS patterns to existing force fields such as GAFF and Sage which allows us to test that our approach can recognize the chemical substructures typically use by human-designed force fields. We then build a SMARTS hierarchy that clusters bonds based on quantum mechanically-derived bond lengths which demonstrates the possibility of creating novel force field chemical perception models.",

        "abstract": "SummaryFor multivariate spatial Gaussian process models, customary specifications of cross-covariance functions do not exploit relational inter-variable graphs to ensure process-level conditional independence between the variables. This is undesirable, especially in highly multivariate settings, where popular cross-covariance functions, such as multivariate Matérn functions, suffer from a curse of dimensionality as the numbers of parameters and floating-point operations scale up in quadratic and cubic order, respectively, with the number of variables. We propose a class of multivariate graphical Gaussian processes using a general construction called stitching that crafts cross-covariance functions from graphs and ensures process-level conditional independence between variables. For the Matérn family of functions, stitching yields a multivariate Gaussian process whose univariate components are Matérn Gaussian processes, and which conforms to process-level conditional independence as specified by the graphical model. For highly multivariate settings and decomposable graphical models, stitching offers massive computational gains and parameter dimension reduction. We demonstrate the utility of the graphical Matérn Gaussian process to jointly model highly multivariate spatial data using simulation examples and an application to air-pollution modelling.",
