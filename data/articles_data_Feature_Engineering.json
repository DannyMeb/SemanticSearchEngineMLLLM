        "abstract": "The fundamental frequency feature is essential for Automatic Speech Recognition because its patterns convey a paralanguage and its tuning normalizes other speech features. Human speech is multidimensional because it is minimally represented by three variables: the intonation (or pitch), the formants (or timbre), and the speech resolution (or depth). These variables represent the hidden states of the local glottal variation, the vocal tract response, and the frequency scale, respectively. Computing them one by one is not as efficient as computing them together, so this article introduces a new speech feature extraction approach. The article is introductory; it focuses on the basic concepts of our new approach and does not elaborate on all applications. It demonstrates that the unit of a cepstral value, which is a spectral value of spectrums, is a unit of acceleration since its discrete variable, the quefrency, can be expressed in Hertz-per-microsecond. The article shows how to produce refined voice analysis from robust estimates and how to reconstruct speech signals from feature spaces. And it concludes that the pitch track of the new approach is as good as two open-source pitch extractors. Combining multiple processes, attenuating background noises, and enabling distant-speech recognition, we introduce the Speech Quefrency Transform (SQT) approach as well as multiple quefrency scales. SQT is a set of frequency transforms whose spectral leakages are controlled per a frequency-modulation model. SQT captures the stationarity of time series onto a hyperspace that resembles the cepstrogram when it is reduced for pitch track extraction.",

This data may be in a structured format or in an unstructured format. Feature engineering process is used to extract features from these data. Selection of features is one of the crucial steps in the feature engineering process. This feature selection process can adopt four different approaches. On that basis, it can be classified into four basic categories, namely filter method, wrapper method, embedded method, and hybrid method. This chapter discusses about different techniques coming under these four categories along with the research work on feature selection. ",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTFeature‐based software and systems product line engineering (feature‐based PLE) has emerged as a modern, repeatable, codified, and proven‐in‐practice specialization of generic product line engineering (PLE) practice. Feature‐based PLE involves an automation‐supported configuration of engineering and operations artifacts from across an enterprise to reflect the feature choices a product embodies. Configuration of artifacts based on feature choices is a powerful narrative, but what actually constitutes a feature? A feature is a distinguishing characteristic that sets products apart (Kang et al. 1990), but in practice this concept encompasses a broad spectrum of granularity. Stakeholders who are concerned with the finest‐grained differences are very different from those who care about the coarsest‐grained differences. This paper presents an ontology for features that is capable of supporting an entire enterprise of product line engineering and business operations, and shows how various stakeholders throughout the enterprise can interact with these different kinds of features.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the use of time-resolved variables to represent the evolution of categorical variables through time. Traditionally, in data science the presence or absence of categorical variables are treated as 1 or 0 with One-Hot Encoding, and then aggregated with compression techniques, such as Principal Components. We annotated time-resolved variables on the Seshat dataset as sequences of categorical features and we compare them to the same categorical features treated with one-hot encoding and Principal Component compression. We find that time-resolved variables are better predictors of the evolution of social scale and social hierarchy, but not of government specialization. We discuss advantages and limitation of the usage of time-resolved variables for the computational analysis of cultural evolution.",

        "abstract": "Effectively classify the fault types and the degradation degree of a rolling bearing is an important basis for accurate malfunction detection. A novel feature extract method - bispectrum image texture features manifold (BTM) of the rolling bearing vibration signal is proposed in this paper. The BTM method is realized by three main steps: bispectrum image analysis, texture feature construction and manifold feature dimensionality reduction. In this method, bispectrum analysis is employed to convert the mass vibration signals into bispectrum contour map, the typical texture features were extracted from the contour map by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), then the manifold dimensionality reduction method liner local tangent space alignment (LLTSA) is used to remove redundant information and reduce the dimension from the extracted texture features and obtain more meaningful low-dimensional information. Furthermore, the low-dimensional texture features were identified by support vector machine (SVM) which was optimized by genetic optimization algorithm (GA). The validity of BTM is confirmed by rolling bear experiments, the result show that the proposed feature extraction method can accurately distinguish different fault types and have a good performance to classify the degradation degree of inner race fault, outer race fault and rolling ball fault.",

        "abstract": "Memory analysis is essential for spotting malicious programs since it can record a variety of traits and behaviors. The detection rate and sophisticated malware obfuscation are two major challenges in malware detection, even though there has been a lot of research in the area. An effective framework that focuses on identifying obfuscation and hidden malware is desperately needed because advanced malware employs obfuscation and other tactics to avoid detection. The VolMemLyzer has been improved in this study to focus on hidden and obfuscated malware when used with a stacked ensemble machine learning model to build a framework for effectively identifying malware. It is one of the most updated memory feature extractors for learning systems.",

        "abstract": "The port environments have some structures that still need regular control. However, the nature of these environments presents a number of challenges in determining an accurate vehicle position and consequently performing successful image similarity detection. These scenarios, however, can have poor visibility conditions and are highly dynamic, making place recognition difficult because the appearance of a place can change over time. Under these operational conditions, imaging sonars are a promising solution. There are some factors that affect the quality of the captured images, but the fact that they do not suffer from haze is a plus. Therefore, in this paper, a purely acoustic similarity detection method based on forward-looking sonar (FLS) data is proposed to overcome the inherent perceptual problems in a port scenario. Considering the lack of available data in this context and to facilitate the variation of environmental parameters and sensor configurations, a port scenario was simulated using the Stonefish simulator. Experiments were conducted on predefined trajectories near structures. The place recognition approach performs better compared to the results obtained with optical imagery. In general, it provides a good compromise in terms of distinctiveness and achieves a performance of 87.5% when appropriate constraints and assumptions are made.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, several industries have registered an impressive improvement in technological advances such as Internet of Things (IoT), e-commerce, vehicular networks, etc. These advances have sparked an increase in the volume of information that gets transmitted from different nodes of a computer network (CN). As a result, it is crucial to safeguard CNs against security threats and intrusions that can compromise the integrity of those systems. In this paper, we propose a machine mearning (ML) intrusion detection system (IDS) in conjunction with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we use the NSL-KDD dataset. Furthermore, we consider the following ML methods in the modelling process: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extra-trees (ET), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB). The results demonstrated that using the GA algorithm has a positive impact on the performance of the selected classifiers. Moreover, the results obtained by the proposed ML methods were superior to existing methodologies.",
