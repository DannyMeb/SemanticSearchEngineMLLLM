In light of the ubiquitous rise of machine translation (MT), the current article considers how\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitional approaches to translation that preceded the MT era, and were formulated with human translation in mind, correspond\n\t\t\t\t\twith today’s MT. The article engages with two influential definitional strands in the discipline: a-priori prescriptive\n\t\t\t\t\tdefinitions, and descriptive definitions focused on the reception of translations. The general compatibility of both definitional\n\t\t\t\t\tapproaches with MT, notwithstanding some empirical and moral criticisms pertaining to the first approach, encourages us to\n\t\t\t\t\tconceive of MT as a full-fledged translational object of inquiry, fully at home in translation studies. Finally, the article\n\t\t\t\t\tsuggests that shifts in the professional status of human translators may lead to new definitions, aimed at differentiating human\n\t\t\t\t\tfrom machine translation by focusing on the notion of (conscious) agency.",

        "abstract": "\n The article looks at the question whether the concept of translation unit might apply to the sphere of machine translation and whether the size of the unit influences the quality of translation. While modern machine translation systems offer an acceptable level of quality, a number of problems mainly related to the structural organization of the text remain unresolved, hence the question posed in the paper. The article offers a review of modern readings of the concept and pays special attention to the question whether the scope of the term changes depending on whether the object of research is the target text or the translation process. The paper also provides a quick look on the research methods for both text-oriented and process-oriented approaches, such as comparative analysis of language pairs and Think Aloud Protocol. Based on a review of existing machine translation models, each of them is analyzed to answer the question whether a unit of translation can be defined for a given system and what its size is. It is concluded that a unit of translation can be viewed as either a unit of analysis or a unit of processing with respect to text-oriented and process-oriented perspectives on to the study of translation. The unit of translation has a dynamic character and influences the quality of the target text. In machine translation, the unit of translation as a unit of analysis is not applicable for systems based on probabilistic non-linguistic methods. For rule-based machine translation systems, both readings of the unit of translation concept are applicable, but hardly go beyond a single sentence. Accordingly, at least one type of translation problem – intra-textual relations resolutions – remains largely unaddressed in the present state of affairs in machine translation.\n\t",

They may be present in different spaces in ways that consumers of the content do not necessarily control or realise, and research to date has paid little attention to these human-MT encounters. This article draws on the philosophy of technology literature to consider implications of MT’s permeating presence in online environments as well as in face-to-face interactions. The focus of the article is on two situations where humans can come across MT: while browsing websites and when speaking with figures of authority. The article highlights ways in which humans’ relationship with MT transcends conscious decisions to operate an MT tool directly. It argues that the human-MT relationship can also be one of immersion where MT blends with the environment in ways that, on the one hand, break language barriers but, on the other, influence, persuade, and on occasion misinform.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n“If you translate long into the machine, the machine translates back into you,” is one of the issues the present article strives to establish and explore qualitatively. I intend to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of machine-assisted translations of significant literary works from a hermeneutical perspective. Essentially, I analyse the output of automated translation platforms such as Google Translate and compare them to human translation. This investigation is valuable in determining whether translators should exercise caution when utilizing translation platforms for culturally rich literary works. Additionally, the article scrutinizes the localisation, cultural, and grammatical coherence of Homer’s The Iliad translated from English to Romanian using the Google Translate platform. The human translations used are rendered into English and Romanian from Greek. As Homer’s Greek remains incomprehensible to the translation platform, we employ a secondary translation technique for a tertiary machine-assisted output. Nonetheless, this approach highlights the serious pitfalls of using translation platforms haphazardly in translation work. This analysis will show how awareness of the machine’s imperfect translation capabilities may, in turn, enhance the human translator’s awareness of what works while translating with the help of a translation application.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, machine translation is considered to be a frequently used tool to render various types of texts related to such different spheres as science, film industry, etc. Statement of the problem: currently, as the higher school system in Kazakhstan starts its’ integration process into world education (Kolomejceva & Makeeva, 2004), together with the re-structuring of the system itself it is a priority to translate course books and manuals from English into Kazakh and Russian and to adapt them for Kazakhstani students. A significant amount of information to be translated and the need to do it at the short notice might cause the use of machine translation tools to speed the translation process up. To clarify advantages and disadvantages of machine translation (especially for manuals and course books), the author applied such methodology as comparative analysis of the source text and its’ translated version. As a result, it is possible to state that machine translation tools are not able to replace the human translation of such complicated texts; moreover, the need of meticulous proofreading of target text is obvious as well as the urgent necessity of translation quality improvement. On the other hand, all the errors which have been observed in the target text, should be specified, categorized, and used in teaching scientific text translation to make it better. The exercises based on comparative analysis and target text proofreading can be considered as an effective tool for translators’ skills development.  The author had chosen the course book Natural Gas Processing from Midstream to Downstream by Elbashir et al. (2019) and its Russian version as a research material for pre-translation and comparative analysis and then for the target text proofreading. So the main goals of the given research consisted in (1) finding out the inappropriate cases of translation; (2) explaining the type of error and (3) preparing the exercises to prevent making such mistakes by our students in Translation Studies and, generally, to improve pre-service translators’ competencies.",

        "abstract": "Focusing on the topic of applying machine translation (MT) to Chinese–English subtitling, the subject of the present study, this article first analyses the current literature and introduces the general constraints in Chinese–English subtitling from three perspectives: technical, cultural, and textual. Technical constraints are imposed by the limited time and space available for each subtitle; cultural constraints relate to the disparities in the beliefs, values, customs, behaviours, and artefacts of different cultural groups; and textual constraints predominantly manifest in the differences between the source and target languages and the segmented nature of subtitles. In order to respond to these constraints and to achieve conciseness, comprehensibility, and coherence in the translated subtitles, this study highlighted condensation, context, and coordination as the key strategies to adopt. However, these strategies pose considerable challenges for MT in Chinese–English subtitling. First, the common practice of full translation by most MT tools tends to work against making subtitles concise. Second, the lack of relevant contextual knowledge limits the ability of MT to generate appropriate translations. Third, the segmented display of subtitles makes it challenging for MT to capture and reflect the logic in the source text, on the one hand, and to produce coherent output in self-contained segments, on the other. To illustrate these constraints and challenges, this article provides examples of bilingual subtitles from American Factory (Bognar & Reichert, 2019), an Oscar Winner for Best Documentary Feature, and compares the official subtitles with those generated by three popular MT tools in Chinese–English translation. The study investigated the efficacy of MT subtitling and its potential to produce quality subtitles; and this article proposes possible solutions and suggestions for improving the quality of MT in subtitling.",

For this purpose, a total of 140 (95 females and 45 males) third- and fourth-year students were recruited through a random sampling. They responded to a paper-and-pen questionnaire with 16 statements about their perception of machine translation. Descriptive statistics was performed to analyse the data. The findings show that most students are knowledgeable about machine translation. In addition, students perceive that using machine translation has benefits, such as saving time, making the translator's job easier, and improving translation competence. However, more than one-third of the student's knowledge level on this subject is partially sufficient. This study can contribute to creating course content for the more effective presentation of machine translation (MT) courses taught in translation and interpreting departments.

Therefore, two NMT systems and two SMT systems were built for the Slovenian–English language pair, each for translation in one direction. We used a multilingual language model to embed the source sentence and translations into the same vector space. From each vector, we extracted features based on the distances and similarities calculated between the source sentence and the NMT translation, and between the source sentence and the SMT translation. To select the best possible translation, we used several well-known classifiers to predict which translation system generated a better translation of the source sentence. The proposed method of combining SMT and NMT in the hybrid system is novel. Our framework is language-independent and can be applied to other languages supported by the multilingual language model. Our experiment involved empirical applications. We compared the performance of the classifiers, and the results demonstrate that our proposed HMT system achieved notable improvements in the BLEU score, with an increase of 1.5 points and 10.9 points for both translation directions, respectively.",

We present the concept of Machine Translation User Experience (MTUX) and compare the effects of traditional post-editing (TPE) and interactive post-editing (IPE) on MTUX, translation quality and productivity. Results suggest that translators prefer IPE to TPE because they are in control of the interaction in this new form of translator-computer interaction and feel more empowered in their interaction with Machine Translation. Productivity results also suggest that IPE may be an interesting alternative to TPE, given the fact that translators worked faster in IPE even though they had no experience in this new machine translation post-editing modality, but were already used to TPE.",

        "abstract": "The rapid global expansion of ChatGPT, which plays a crucial role in interactive knowledge sharing and translation, underscores the importance of comparative performance assessments in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This study concentrated on this crucial issue by exploring and contrasting the translation performances of large language models (LLMs) and neural machine translation (NMT) systems. For this aim, the APIs of Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT were utilized, leveraging parallel corpora from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) 2018 and 2020 benchmarks. By applying recognized evaluation metrics such as BLEU, chrF, and TER, a comprehensive performance analysis across a variety of language pairs, translation directions, and reference token sizes was conducted. The findings reveal that while Google Translate and Microsoft Translator generally surpass ChatGPT in terms of their BLEU, chrF, and TER scores, ChatGPT exhibits superior performance in specific language pairs. Translations from non-English to English consistently yielded better results across all three systems compared with translations from English to non-English. Significantly, an improvement in translation system performance was observed as the token size increased, hinting at the potential benefits of training models on larger token sizes.",

Moreover, unlike human translators, the neural machine system is not capable of activities such as summarizing the source texts, making comments or annotating. But on the other hand, the neural machine translation system has the advantages of its own. Not affected by bias like human translators, it could perform the translation faster and with a rather objective stance. All in all, there is still a long way to go before it can reveal the political and ideological factors in ways as human translators can achieve.",

        "abstract": "The Norwegian business-to-business (B2B) market for bicycles consists mainly of international brands, such as Shimano, Trek, Cannondale, and Specialized. The product descriptions for these brands are usually in English and need local translation. However, these product descriptions include bicycle-specific terminologies that are challenging for online translators, such as Google. For this reason, local companies outsource translation or translate product descriptions manually, which is cumbersome. In light of the Norwegian B2B bicycle industry, this paper explores transfer learning to improve the machine translation of bicycle-specific terminology from English to Norwegian, including generic text. Firstly, we trained a custom Named-Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify cycling-specific terminology and then adapted a MarianMT neural machine translation model for the translation process. Due to the lack of publicly available bicycle-terminology-related datasets to train the proposed models, we created our dataset by collecting a corpus of cycling-related texts. We evaluated the performance of our proposed model and compared its performance with that of Google Translate. Our model outperformed Google Translate on the test set, with a SacreBleu score of 45.099 against 36.615 for Google Translate on average. We also created a web application where the user can input English text with related bicycle terminologies, and it will return the detected cycling-specific words in addition to a Norwegian translation.",

Bu bağlamda fiili olarak yarım asrı aşkın süredir, çeviri üzerinde insan faktörünü nasıl ortadan kaldırırız sorusu üzerine tartışılmış, bilgisayarlar ve yazılımlar aracılığıyla bu amaç gerçekleştirilmeye çalışılmıştır. Aslında burada temel sorunsal insan öznesinin varlığından ziyade, çevirinin mümkün olduğunca daha hızlı bir şekilde gerçekleştirilmesini sağlamaktır. İlerleyen süreçte insan öznesinden bağımsız bir çeviri eyleminin gerçekleştirilemeyeceğinin kavranması üzerine, çeviride insan çabasının nasıl en aza indirilebileceği ve bu sayede çevirilere hız kazandırılabileceği üzerine çalışmalar yürütülmüştür. Bu bağlamda, bu çalışmada kısaca makine çevirilerinin (MÇ) gelişim sürecine yer verilmiş, temelde ise farklı makine çevirisi programları hakkında bilgiler sunulmuş ve bunların değişik metin türü kesitleri üzerindeki başarıları mercek altına alınmıştır.

        "abstract": "In an increasingly globalized world, technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) have catalysed the proliferation of audiovisual productions and their translation, leading to new dynamics in the professional landscape. Tools and practices such as machine translation (MT) and post-editing (PE) are becoming widespread, augmenting and diversifying translators’ tasks and creating new professional profiles and educational needs. While some specialized fields with more restrictive languages and terminology have readily incorporated MT, recent developments in neural MT (NMT) engines have led to their use in more creative areas such as literary or audiovisual translation (AVT). However, this trend raises concerns about the quality of both the raw and the final output, user perceptions, ethics and working conditions. Academic studies which explore the convergence of MT and AVT therefore become crucial to understanding the implications of this technology for all stakeholders: professionals, students and instructors, researchers, audiences and society at large. This article delves into the impact of neural MT and other AI-based tools on AVT workflows, both professionally and academically, and stresses the need for further research in this area. It then proceeds to outline the main research directions in this field as evidenced by the contributions included in this special issue, particularly those regarding the incorporation of MT into different AVT modes.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the experiences and perspectives of advanced language learners on the use of Machine Translation Tools (MTTs). The study focuses on how learners navigate their use of tools like Google Translate, DeepL, and Reverso, and how their usage is influenced by instructional recommendations. Nine learners, studying different languages at an advanced level, were interviewed in focus groups. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed key themes related to the use of Online Language Learning Tools (OLLTs) and MTTs, students' uncertainty about MTT functionalities, policies regarding MTT use, and suggestions for MTT training. The findings highlight the significant impact of initial encounters with MTTs on learners' long-term perceptions and use of these tools. Participants demonstrated strategic use of MTTs to support their reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, while being aware of their limitations. Although learners found MTTs helpful, they also emphasised the importance of authentic communication in language learning. The study concludes with recommendation for a collaborative approach between teachers and learners to effectively integrate MTTs into the language learning curriculum.",

        "abstract": "Translation is a challenge for humans since it needs a good command of two or more languages. When it comes to computer programs, it is even more complex as it is difficult for computers to imitate human translators. With the emergence of deep learning algorithms, especially neural network architectures, neural machine translation (NMT) models gradually outperformed previous machine translation models and became the new mainstream in practical machine translation (MT) systems. Nowadays, NMT has been developing for several years and has been applied in many fields. This paper is focused on studies on four different application categories of NMT models: 1) Text NMT; 2) Automatic program repair (based on NMT); 3) Simultaneous translation. Our work provides a summary of the latest research on different applications of NMT and makes comments on their development in the future. This paper also mentioned the shortcomings of existing studies in this essay and pointed out some possible research directions.",

The object of research is English-language marketing texts. The subject of the research is machine translation of English marketing texts. We point out the importance of marketing texts in translation as it is important to convey emotions, impressions and brand image while working with this material. So, the importance of complex analysis and detailed description of translation solutions in the translation of marketing texts determines the relevance present article’s theme. This article focuses on the major machine translation systems such as the domestic service PROMT.One, the American Google Translate and the German service DeepL. These online translators are considered to be some of the key services with multifaceted features which are currently universal tools for learning and working with foreign languages. The problems of adequacy of machine translation, current mistakes and distortions made by machine translation systems in translation are also highlighted in this article. During the analysis lexical-semantic, syntactic and stylistic errors have been identified and systematized in order to use correctly computer programs for translation. It should be noted that translating marketing texts, machine translation systems have not evolved to the point when checking the translation does not lead to post-editing.",

They reported high frequency of NMT use in their translation learning as well as English major learning. Instead of directly borrowing the NMT output, most of them post-edited it and/or used it as inspiration to accomplish their translation tasks. Although they evaluated NMT in a positive way and held an optimistic view toward the future of translation career, they expressed varying degrees of worry and anxiety toward their future employment and toward the use of NMT in the process of the translation learning. They clearly articulated the needs for NMT instruction in translation courses. Based on these findings, this paper proposes several ways to help reduce the learners’ worry and anxiety in translation instruction.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenges of social media as a means of interaction is to ensure media accessibility, i. e. to provide users with a free and unhindered access to the content of computer-mediated communication platforms. In the context of global networking, linguistic constraints due to the use of a verbal code different from the language of the potential user while creating media content, are not the least of the obstacles to such access. Given the obvious dominance of English in the online space, this is mainly a matter of expanding the audience by engaging individuals whose source language proficiency is not sufficient for unimpeded use of social media, in particular for viewing, listening and understanding video content uploaded on video hosting sites and other digital platforms. Since user-generated video content is generally characterised by individual and independent production, free accessibility and target audiences sharing a common interest for a specific subject matter, regardless of their residence area and language affiliation, human audio-visual translation is not considerable in such circumstances. For this reason, as a way to overcome language barriers and ensure media accessibility, the most advanced Internet portals are beginning to implement Web-based online machine translation solutions, made possible by the development of linguistic digital technologies. The survey conducted as a part of this study has shed light on the users’ perception of machine voice-over translation of English-language travel vlogs into Russian, and formulated some hypotheses regarding the ways to further improve its quality. The empirical evidence for this study was obtained from a two-step survey involving users and experts (audiovisual translators) who assessed the quality of machine voice translation of English-language travel vlog into Russian. According to the results ontained machine translation seems to be conceptually acceptable as a means of enabling language media accessibility in social media.",

        "abstract": "Audiovisual translation (AVT), broadly understood as a synonym for media content localization, and not only as a particular practice of linguistic transfer, is undergoing a revolution that was unthinkable only a few years ago – even in those territories where viewers are less accustomed to localized content. Digitalization and technological changes, which have had such an impact on the way audiovisual texts – whether original, localized, or adapted – are produced, distributed, edited, consumed, and shared have also had a substantial impact on the AVT profession. This article explores the ways in which technology has been evolving as an aid to translators: from being merely a clerical aid for transcribing digital texts to automating tasks and integrating machine translation into human translation processes. This it does by providing a range of tools to assist translators in their work processes, progressively migrating both tools and processes to cloud-based environments. The focus is then on AVT, and more particularly on dubbing, where digitalization has shaped the consumer market and posed several challenges to language technology developments and AVT professional practices. Academia has also paid attention to such developments and has increasingly dealt with a number of matters affecting both practice and training to cater to the needs of current media markets. A final word is devoted to proposing a literacy-based framework for the training of translators that embraces technology so as to incorporate automation as an additional aid and which redefines the audiovisual translator’s workstation.",

        "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation with the potential to overcome many weaknesses in conventional phrase-based translation systems. However, there are still grey areas that need attention in the field of machine translation, mainly in the context of literary translation and poetic language. This research aims to identify the shortcomings of the NMT in addressing ambiguity and the semantic complexities of poetic expressions that are important in translating literature in a cross-cultural and multilingual context. Furthermore, while human translators struggle to retain naturalness and accuracy in translation, this research aims to identify to what extent machine translation could convey the message in translating literary-based texts from Persian into English. The corpus of this study consists of Forty ghazals from the Divan of Hafiz, which is translated by a computer-assisted translation software, memoQ and then compared to the authentic translation of Hafiz by Henry Wilberforce Clarke. This comparative descriptive study portrayed the challenges and issues related to Hafiz’s poems, which demonstrate that the literary touch is lost in MT products.",

        "abstract": "Due to the widespread use of data-driven neural machine translation, both by professional translators and layperson users, an adequate machine translation literacy on the part of the users of this technology is becoming more and more important. At the same time, the increasing datafication of both the private and the business sphere requires an adequate data literacy in modern society. The present article takes a closer look at machine translation literacy and data literacy and investigates the interface between the two concepts. This is done to lay the preliminary theoretical foundations for a didactic project aiming to develop didactic resources for teaching data literacy in its machine translation-specific form to students of BA programmes in translation/specialised communication.",

        "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) increasingly has the potential to facilitate or impede second language learning in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom. To understand teacher and EFL learner perspectives about its use, two surveys of 20 university professors (10 non-native English teachers and 10 native English teachers) and 139 EFL students were carried out. To measure MT’s capacity to promote language awareness, a comparative study with an online dictionary was done, using two translation tasks, a posttest, and a post-questionnaire. The preliminary survey results revealed variations in how learners and teachers perceive text-based machine translation as a valuable tool for language learning and how much they felt its use by students in educational settings should be accepted. Analysis of the posttest also found significant differences in the capacity of DeepL (MT network) to promote language awareness compared to the online dictionary, which aligned with the students’ post-questionnaire feedback. These results emphasise the need for additional research and workplace dialogues going forward, regarding the incorporation and supervision of MT in L2 instruction.",

The researcher chose Naguib Mahfouz's novel Bayn Al-Qasrain ‘Palace Walk’ to study the differences between human and machine translation, so this study is based on comparing the results of human and machine translation of literary texts, in particular Naguib Mahfouz's novel Bayn Al-Qasrain ‘Palace Walk’, in addition to researching the strategies used by them. Finally, the researcher will shed light on the errors and problems faced by humans and machines in translating cultural expressions from Arabic into English.",

        "abstract": "Machine translation received intensive research in different language pairs; yet, the quality of specialized translation; e.g., legal translation, from Arabic into English received little attention. The present study investigates the quality of machine translation of legal texts from Arabic into English. The paper aims at examining the errors found in the machine translation of legal texts from Arabic into English. It also studies the legal discourse features in machine-translation output. The research questions tackle the accuracy of machine translation of legal discourse and error categories and frequencies in machine translation. The researcher evaluated several factors to assess the quality of Google Translate; i.e., lexical, syntactic, and register-related errors. The study data consists of five legislative texts. The researcher conducted a manual error assessment and classification. To ensure the reliability of the error analysis, an existing human translation of the documents was used as a reference to ensure the reliability of the MT quality assessment and post-editing process. Later, the errors were classified, and their percentages and frequencies were calculated. A few examples of errors in each category were discussed and analysed. The highest error category was lexical errors scoring 43.4%. The last detected error category was deletion with a percentage of 1.7%.  Syntactic errors constituted one-fourth of the errors found in the data. Legal register-related errors scored 30.2%. The subcategories of legal register-related errors varied in their occurrence; e.g., one-third of the errors related to legal discourse were legal terms. The study concluded that machine translation; though it provided a comprehensible output, could not translate legal structures and terminology perfectly.",

        "abstract": "This article is about the field of technical translation which is called machine translation (MT), or machine-assisted translation. This method of translation uses various types of computer software to generate translations from a source language to a target language without the assistance of a human. There are different methods of machine translation. A plethora of machine translators in the form of free search engines are available online. However, within the field of technical communication, there are two basic types of machine translators, which are able to translate massive amounts of text at a time. There are transfer-based and data-driven machine translators. Transfer-based machine translation systems, which are quite costly to develop, are built by linguists who determine the grammar rules for the source and target languages. The machine works within the rules and guidelines developed by the linguist. Due to the nature of developing rules for the system, this can be very time-consuming and requires an extensive knowledge base about the structures of the languages on the part of the linguist; nonetheless, the majority of commercial machine translators are transfer-based machines. .",

        "abstract": "French is a strategically and economically important language in the regions where the African language Twi is spoken. However, only a very small proportion of Twi speakers in Ghana speak French. The development of a Twi–French parallel corpus and corresponding machine translation applications would provide various advantages, including stimulating trade and job creation, supporting the Ghanaian diaspora in French-speaking nations, assisting French-speaking tourists and immigrants seeking medical care in Ghana, and facilitating numerous downstream natural language processing tasks. Since there are hardly any machine translation systems or parallel corpora between Twi and French that cover a modern and versatile vocabulary, our goal was to extend a modern Twi–English corpus with French and develop machine translation systems between Twi and French: Consequently, in this paper, we present our Twi–French corpus of 10,708 parallel sentences. Furthermore, we describe our machine translation experiments with this corpus. We investigated direct machine translation and cascading systems that use English as a pivot language. Our best Twi–French system is a direct state-of-the-art transformer-based machine translation system that achieves a BLEU score of 0.76. Our best French–Twi system, which is a cascading system that uses English as a pivot language, results in a BLEU score of 0.81. Both systems are fine tuned with our corpus, and our French–Twi system even slightly outperforms Google Translate on our test set by 7% relative.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nFriction stir extrusion is a variation of friction stir processing, of which the most well-known is friction stir welding where a non-cutting rotating probe comes into contact with two metal sheets or plates. For friction stir welding, the friction between a rotating probe and the two metal sheets generates heat so that the temperature of the sheets increases above the recrystallization temperature and the material of the two metal sheets are stirred and upon cooling, results in a joined sheet. Within the stir zone, the grain structure is an ultrafine.\nFor friction stir extrusion, the rotating probe is plunged into a work piece and the resulting heat raises the work piece to above the recrystallization temperature as either a solid or hollow cylindrical rod is formed.\nThe previous version of the custom-built machine friction stir machine had significant vibration present during tests, difficulty in mounting the tooling on to the machine, errors in the workpiece temperature readings, alignment of the probe and work piece, and other manufacturing defects that made the machine difficult to be used for research and testing.\nThis paper documents improvements to the friction stir machine and provides preliminary test data prior to a full-scale investigation of friction stir extrusion processes. Data in the paper includes observations, pictures, and force and temperature results.",

However, the high-dimensional, sparse, and imbalanced nature of the data poses significant challenges to yield and quality root cause analysis. Deep Topological Data Analysis (DTDA) is an unsupervised machine learning method that clusters and models the data in the form of geometric objects such as graphs and their higher-dimensional versions. This method reduces the multidimensional dataset to two-dimensional networks or graphs, where each node represents a cluster of samples with similar characteristics, and an edge represents the presence of overlapping characteristics between the connecting nodes. DTDA provides insights into the necessary data elements required to conduct accurate analysis and helps engineers identify the features contributing to yield and quality issues, enabling corrective actions. Moreover, the approach prevents the waste of engineering resources and mitigates the impact on final manufacturing cost.",

Following the Bologna process which aims to improve the quality of higher education, this course has been added recently to the department’s curriculum and taught to fourth-year students of the academic year (2022-2023) as part of the requirements of their graduation project, viz., translation project, which is their main course. Having completed the course, a close-ended questionnaire was distributed to seventy-five students to evaluate the course. Following the quantitative approach in this study research design, the course mostly achieved ‘very good’ results regarding question themes pertinent to the instructor, the course, and the student’s self-evaluation. This study has significant implications for the educational process in that it stresses the need for continuous updating of the curriculum of the department and consequently students’ competences to meet evolving market needs",

In practice, the variation of languages, the limitation of semantic knowledge, and the lack of parallel language resources limit the development of machine translation.\r\nOBJECTIVES: This paper aims to avoid duplicating neural networks during the learning process and improve the ability to generalize complex neural network machine translation models with limited resources.\r\nMETHODS: Textual material in the source language was studied, and a suitable textual material representation model was used to express complex, high-level, and abstract semantic information. Then, a more efficient neural network machine translation integration model was developed based on the control of written data and algorithms.\r\nRESULTS: Data mining must be applied to complex neural network machine translation systems based on transfer learning to standardize finite neural network models.\r\nCONCLUSION: Neural network-based embedded machine translation systems based on migration training require a small number of labelled samples to improve the system's permeability. However, this adaptive migration learning region approach can easily lead to over-learning problems in neural network machine translation models, thus avoiding excessive correspondences during the learning process and improving the generalization ability of the translation model with limited neural network resources.",
