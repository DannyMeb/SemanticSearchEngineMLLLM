        "abstract": "Abstract\nInsurance fraud is a growing concern, prompting proactive measures through advanced machine learning techniques. This research focuses on constructing a predictive model for distinguishing genuine and fraudulent auto insurance claims. The dataset, comprising 1,000 instances and 40 attributes, covers customer demographics, policy details, incidents, and financial data. Early fraud detection is crucial for financial loss mitigation and maintaining insurance system integrity. The study employs data preprocessing to handle missing values and features XGBoost importance, variance thresholding, and correlation analysis for enhanced model interpretability. The machine learning model integrates nine algorithms, with a hard-voting ensemble of Logistic Regression and XGBoost demonstrating competitive accuracy, reaching 83.0%. Results highlight Linear Discriminant Analysis as the leading classifier, achieving 84% accuracy. The ensemble approach achieves 83.0% accuracy with a notable precision of 91%, showcasing the strength of combining diverse models. The study emphasizes the significance of preprocessing, feature selection, and ensemble learning for fraud detection optimization. The refined model achieves a minimal Brier loss of 0.00054, indicating minimal discrepancies in predicted probabilities and actual outcomes in binary classification. Exploration of principal component analysis (PCA) with multiple linear regression reveals a trade-off between model simplicity and performance. Retaining 32 components preserves 95% of variance, achieving a balance at 0.7967, while keeping 35 components reaches the highest value of 0.9991, showcasing dimensionality reduction's potential to capture nearly all the data variance.",

        "abstract": "The winding path of this research into fraud detection using traditional machine learning (ML) led us through landscapes of both impressive strides and thought-provoking hurdles. As we retrace our steps, revisiting key findings and peering into the technology's potential, a nuanced understanding of its effectiveness comes into focus. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating the surprising efficacy of traditional ML algorithms in combating fraudulent activities. By meticulously dissecting the Credit Card Fraud dataset and employing a rigorous methodological approach, we established that these algorithms can achieve commendable accuracy in identifying suspicious transactions. This not only reaffirms the viability of ML in fraud detection but also offers a valuable roadmap for future research and practical implementation. Our journey unveiled a fascinating tapestry of insights. We observed that different ML algorithms excel in specific domains. While Random Forest and Gradient Boosting proved to be overall champions, Logistic Regression [19] displayed exceptional talent in pinpointing certain types of fraudulent behavior. This underscores the importance of wielding a diverse arsenal of algorithms to achieve comprehensive fraud detection. Furthermore, we discovered that feature engineering is not merely a parlor trick, but a crucial stage in the dance with fraud. By crafting tailored features from the raw data, we were able to significantly enhance the accuracy of our models. This highlights the critical role of domain expertise in understanding the subtle nuances of fraudulent transactions and translating them into actionable features for ML algorithms. However, the ever-shifting sands of fraud necessitate constant vigilance and adaptation. Our research emphasizes the paramount importance of real-time monitoring and model updates to stay ahead of evolving fraudster tactics. This agility will be the key to unlocking the full potential of ML in this dynamic arena. Yet, our exploration would be remiss if it failed to acknowledge the limitations that linger within traditional ML. The \"black box\" nature of some algorithms can hinder interpretability and raise concerns about bias. Additionally, their reliance on historical data can render them vulnerable to novel fraud schemes that haven't yet graced the training dataset. However, these challenges should not overshadow the immense potential of traditional ML. Its ability to handle large datasets, learn from experience, and adapt to changing patterns remains invaluable in the fight against fraud. By combining traditional ML with other approaches, such as explainable AI and deep learning, we can unlock even greater capabilities and build robust, interpretable fraud detection systems that are not only effective, but also transparent and accountable. This research journey into traditional ML for fraud detection has illuminated both its strengths and weaknesses, paving the way for future advancements. By embracing its potential and addressing its limitations, we can leverage this powerful technology to create a safer and more secure digital landscape for everyone. The path forward lies in harnessing the diverse power of ML, while remaining mindful of its limitations, to build a future where fraudsters find themselves perpetually outwitted and outmaneuvered.",

        "abstract": "To make life better, many mechanisms in modern environment are carried out via the Internet. The economy is expanding yet on the other side, there is a lot of illegal and unauthorised activity carried throughout the country that is seriously hampering that progress. Scam instances, which mislead individuals while also causing economic losses, are just one of them. In realistic conditions, fraud involving credit cards surveillance is the main emphasis of this research. Contrary to earlier eras, the number of credit card scammers is drastically increasing right now. Criminals use various forms of innovation, fake documents, and deception to con others and take their cash. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to discover a solution to these frauds. As technology advances, it becomes harder to keep up with the behaviour and trends of illegal activities. Ai technology, machine learning, as well as other relevant data technology fields have advanced to the point that it is currently feasible to expedite this process and reduce the volume of labour-intensive effort needed in recognizing credit card scams. The user-submitted utilization of credit cards database might be collected initially, then using machine learning approach; it would be split into databases for testing and training purposes. This methodical technique could be utilized by researchers once they have evaluated both the larger information collection and the user-provided available data collection. Enhance the accuracy of the outcome statistics after that. Depending on its exactness and precision, a technology's efficiency is assessed. The results show that XG-Boost and Random Forest techniques have the greatest performance.",

        "abstract": "Due to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, industries are heavily reliant on online meeting platforms. The pandemic has forced most MNCs to rely on online platforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams to hold daily business meetings and even conferences and other corporate events. Schools and other educational institutions have also been forced to conduct classes and all other events through these platforms. This increased unavoidable dependence on online platforms has resulted in an exponential increase in advertising fraud. Advertising fraud is the application of any method or technology that hampers the proper delivery of advertisements to the proper audience or the proper place, or forcefully inserts advertisements at undesirable times or locations. This could take multiple forms and has become far more widespread with increased use of online platforms. Some common methods used for digital fraud can be the pay-per-click (PPC) model, domain spoofing or in the form of bots, but the main objective is to gain financial advantages from advertising transactions. The primary objective of this study is to identify and understand the factors lying behind the presence of fraudulent activities on any online medium and to analyse the probability of downloading an application after coming across the online advertisement, and watching it. The study also aims to highlight how marketing agencies tend to float fraud advertisement just to gain more revenue from their end.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIdentification of geographical origin is of great importance for protecting the authenticity of valuable agri-food products with designated origins. In this study, a robust and accurate analytical method that could authenticate the geographical origin of Geographical Indication (GI) products was developed. The method was based on elemental profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with machine learning techniques for model building and feature selection. The method successfully predicted and classified six varieties of Chinese GI rice. The elemental profiles of 131 rice samples were determined, and two machine learning algorithms were implemented, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), together with the feature selection algorithm Relief. Prediction accuracy of 100% was achieved by both Relief-SVM and Relief-RF models, using only four elements (Al, B, Rb, and Na). The methodology and knowledge from this study could be used to develop reliable methods for tracing geographical origins and controlling fraudulent labeling of diverse high-value agri-food products.",

In recent years, allegations of corporate misconduct have raised questions about the prevailing norm of conformity. This chapter discusses the effect of law on corporate activity by comparing the provisions of law with the actual conduct of business in the market. In particular, it explores how such legislation causes a greater commitment of corporate entities to legal enforcement than others. The inference drawn is that the existing ruleâ€”an ambiguous common law or statutory requirementâ€”usually has to do with corporate conduct that evades the requirement or underlying intent of the law or ignores it. In its fraud policy and fraud response plan, the strategy of a company to deal with fraud should be explicitly defined. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImbalanced data often performs poorly in the model and can prevent the model from capturing a few classes of samples, so it is crucial to process imbalanced data. This paper is a credit card fraud detection based on imbalanced data, comparing different processing methods for imbalanced data and using machine learning to detect credit card fraud, and finally arriving at optimal results. Since credit card fraud data is mostly a dichotomous problem and highly imbalanced, it means that the machine learning model favors the majority of the samples and treats the fraudulent transactions in the credit card fraud data as correct transactions. The treatment of imbalanced data is crucial because of the low percentage of fraudulent data. We used different methods for imbalanced data such as oversampling, undersampling, combined sampling and using class weights to improve the class imbalance and applied these methods to credit card fraud detection and calculated Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score and AUC. Because of the severe imbalance in the data, the model is biased towards majority of the samples, so the accuracy of the model will be high. Because we focus more on the probability that a minority class of the sample is correctly classified, to check the performance of the model, we will use the F1 score, the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). and recall as measures instead of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the model achieves the best performance by resampling the credit card fraud data, and finding the optimal weights for different category samples by grid search when setting the category weights leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the logistic regression model, and the random forest outperforms all the machine learning models that are compared.",

        "abstract": "Medical insurance fraud poses significant challenges to the healthcare industry, impacting financial resources and patient care. This research explores the application of machine learning methodologies to detect fraudulent activities within healthcare insurance claims. Medical insurance fraud detection is crucial to help insurance companies save money. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to detect fraudulent activities in the healthcare industry. Fraud can be spread broadly and extremely costly to the therapeutic protection framework. Protection can be made unscrupulous and be a case designed to hide or alter such information meant for social insurance benefits. Cheats might be numerous and submitted by the protection guarantor or the safeguarded. The unscrupulous social insurance providers are the reason for extortion in the well-being segment.   This research approach is to apply machine learning to find incidents of medical insurance fraud automatically. In conclusion, machine learning is a promising tool for detecting medical insurance fraud. It can help insurers detect fraudulent activities in real time, saving money on bogus claims.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there is a huge increase in digital financial fraud as a result of the widespread usage of credit cards for online purchases. Therefore, a credit card fraud detection method with high accuracy, minimizing the risk of losing money when the transaction occurs, becomes imperative. The study first processed a synthetic data set, discarding useless features, using one hot encoding to convey categorical information to numerical ones and separating the training and testing datasets. Based on the new formed datasets, the study built three Machine Learning (ML) models for fraud detection, which are the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, the logistic regression model and the decision tree model, respectively. Next, the study implemented on training these three models by fitting the model on training datasets and predicting the test data in testing datasets. Lastly, the heatmap named confusion matrix was provided to visualize the outcomes, indicating the accuracy of each model. Also, the study uses another four performance measurement scores which are Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC score), accuracy classification score, balanced F1 score and precision score for evaluating models. Comparing these three models based on the confusion matrix and the four accuracy scores, the study explored that the decision tree model can achieve the best performance compared to other models in predicting fraud.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare fraud is intentionally submitting false claims or producing misinterpretation of facts to obtain entitlement payments. Thus, it wastes healthcare financial resources and increases healthcare costs. Subsequently, fraud poses a substantial financial challenge. Therefore, supervised machine and deep learning analytics such as random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks are successfully used to detect healthcare insurance fraud. This study aims to develop a health model that automatically detects fraud from health insurance claims in Saudi Arabia. The model indicates the greatest contributing factor to fraud with optimal accuracy. The labeled imbalanced dataset used three supervised deep and machine learning methods. The dataset was obtained from three healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The applied models were random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. The SMOT technique was used to balance the dataset. Boruta object feature selection was applied to exclude insignificant features. Validation metrics were accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Random forest classifiers indicated policy type, education, and age as the most significant features with an accuracy of 98.21%, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, an F1 score of 99.03%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 90.00%. Logistic regression resulted in an accuracy of 80.36%, 97.62% precision, 80.39% recall, an F1 score of 88.17%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 80.20%. ANN revealed an accuracy of 94.64%, 98.00% precision, 96.08% recall, an F1 score of 97.03%, a specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 88.04%. This predictive analytics study applied three successful models, each of which yielded acceptable accuracy and validation metrics; however, further research on a larger dataset is advised.",

In this research, a comprehensive evaluation method is borrowed to compare performances between different machine learning models. More precisely, this research uses the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric to evaluate and compare performances between four different machine learning models with the same transaction information dataset. The four models are K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. In this research, a dataset that contains over one million credit card transaction data is processed and divided into training data and testing data. After preprocessing, the same training data are fitted into four different models and being test against the same testing data. After a series of hyperparameter tuning, the AUC score of each model is obtained and compared. The comparison result indicates that Random Forest makes the most accurate and consistent predictions on fraudulent transactions in this dataset, and thus can be recommended as the primary machine learning algorithm to prevent credit card fraudulent transactions.",

        "abstract": "The use of credit cards and online banking is expanding exponentially. As more individuals use debit cards, credit cards, and internet banking, the likelihood of falling victim to various forms of fraud also rises. Due to ignorance, credit card company customers have provided their card details, personal information, and one-time password to an unknown bogus caller on several occasions in the recent past. One of the biggest issues facing financial institutions and customers alike is credit card theft. It may result in large financial losses and harm to the financial institution's image. While there are several ways to identify credit card fraud, one of the best is machine learning.By using past data, machine learning algorithms may be trained to recognize trends and abnormalities that point to fraud. The state-of-the-art in machine learning for credit card fraud detection is reviewed in this study. Numerous research on the same subject have been conducted in the past with a variety of well-known machine-learning techniques. However, with a grasp of the notion of hybrid machine learning, we will now examine how well hybrid machine learning performs on the same problem statement. ",

The outcome of machine learning is used as samples for the fraud detection team. Data analysis is performed through data processing, feature selection, hold-on methods, and accuracy testing. There are five machine learning methods applied in this study: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Historical data are divided into two groups: training data and test data. The results show that the Random Forest algorithm has the highest accuracy with a training score of 0.994999 and a test score of 0.745437. This means that the Random Forest algorithm is the most accurate method for detecting fraud. Further research is suggested to add more predictor variables to increase the accuracy value and apply this method to different financial institutions and different industries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a means of building explainable machine learning models for Big Data, we apply a novel ensemble supervised feature selection technique. The technique is applied to publicly available insurance claims data from the United States public health insurance program, Medicare. We approach Medicare insurance fraud detection as a supervised machine learning task of anomaly detection through the classification of highly imbalanced Big Data. Our objectives for feature selection are to increase efficiency in model training, and to develop more explainable machine learning models for fraud detection. Using two Big Data datasets derived from two different sources of insurance claims data, we demonstrate how our feature selection technique reduces the dimensionality of the datasets by approximately 87.5% without compromising performance. Moreover, the reduction in dimensionality results in machine learning models that are easier to explain, and less prone to overfitting. Therefore, our primary contribution of the exposition of our novel feature selection technique leads to a further contribution to the application domain of automated Medicare insurance fraud detection. We utilize our feature selection technique to provide an explanation of our fraud detection models in terms of the definitions of the selected features. The ensemble supervised feature selection technique we present is flexible in that any collection of machine learning algorithms that maintain a list of feature importance values may be used. Therefore, researchers may easily employ variations of the technique we present.",

First, standard models are utilized. Then, hybrid techniques consisting of Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and majority voting are implemented. To evaluate the effectiveness of the version, a set of publicly accessible credit card records is utilized. Then, credit card records from a real-world economic institution are analyzed. The experimental results suggest that Random Forest and majority voting accomplish precise accuracy estimates for detecting credit card fraud instances.",

        "abstract": "The Credit card frauds represent facile and amiable targets, particularly as the proliferation of e-commerce and various online platforms has led to a commensurate expansion in online payment modalities, thereby augmenting the susceptibility to online fraudulent activities. In response to the escalating rates of fraudulent incidents, researchers have undertaken the utilization of diverse machine learning methodologies to ascertain and scrutinize frauds within the realm of online transactions.\nThe primary objective of this scholarly endeavor is to formulate and advance an innovative fraud detection modus operandi tailored for Streaming Transaction Data. The overarching goal is to meticulously scrutinize the historical transaction particulars of patrons and distill discernible behavioral patterns. This involves the clustering of cardholders into disparate cohorts predicated upon their transactional magnitudes. Subsequently, a sliding window strategy is employed to amalgamate transactions conducted by cardholders across distinct groups, facilitating the extraction of their respective behavioral patterns.\nConsecutively, diverse classifiers trained on these distinct groups, and the classifier exhibiting superior rating scores is earmarked as one of the preeminent methods for prognosticating fraudulent activities. This is succeeded by the implementation of a feedback mechanism aimed at mitigating the challenges posed by the phenomenon of concept drift. The empirical investigation detailed in this paper is grounded in the analysis of a European credit card fraud dataset.\nIt is imperative for credit card companies to adeptly discern instances of fraudulent credit card transactions to preclude customers from incurring charges for items they did not legitimately acquire. The resolution to such quandaries lies in the realm of Data Science, a discipline whose significance, when coupled with Machine Learning, is of paramount importance. This undertaking endeavors to elucidate the construction of a model utilizing machine learning techniques for Credit Card Fraud Detection.\nThe Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem entails the modeling of historical credit card transactions, incorporating data from those that transpired as fraudulent. Subsequently, this model is employed to ascertain the veracity of new transactions, distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent activities. The primary aim is the meticulous detection of 100% of fraudulent transactions, while concurrently minimizing instances of erroneous classifications of non-fraudulent transactions. Credit Card Fraud Detection serves as a quintessential exemplar of classification challenges.\nIn the course of this endeavor, significant emphasis has been placed on the analysis and pre-processing of datasets. Furthermore, a diverse array of anomaly detection algorithms, including the Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest algorithm, have been deployed on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformed Credit Card Transaction data. \nKEYWORDS: Card-Not-Present frauds, Card-Present-Frauds, Concept Drift,,Credit card fraud, applications of machine  \nlearning, data science.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has limited peopleâ€™s mobility to a certain extent, making it difficult to purchase goods and services offline, which has led the creation of a culture of increased dependence on online services. One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms previous models with an AUC value of 97.94%, a Recall value of 95.91%, and an F1-Score value of 87.40%.",

However, the transparency and vulnerability of the internet have opened new avenues for illicit access, resulting in a significant surge in financial fraud cases, particularly credit card transaction fraud. Detecting and mitigating such incidents has become crucial. One branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning, offers a potent solution. It operates by utilizing various algorithms and models that rely on established patterns and reasoning without explicit instructions. By processing vast amounts of historical data, machine learning models can identify underlying data relationships, allowing them to make accurate predictions based on input data. Therefore, it emerges as a highly effective method for credit card transaction fraud detection.
