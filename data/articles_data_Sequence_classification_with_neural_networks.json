        "abstract": "In-air signatures are promising applications that have been investigated extensively in the past decades; an in-air signature involves gathering datasets through portable devices, such as smartwatches. During the signing process, individuals wear smartwatches on their wrists and sign their names in the air. The dataset we used in this study collected in-air signatures from 22 participants, resulting in a total of 440 smartwatch in-air signature signals. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm was applied to verify the usability of the dataset. This paper analyzes and compares the performances of multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the transformer using median-sized smartwatch in-air signatures. For the four CNN models, the in-air digital signature data were first transformed into visible three-dimensional static signatures. For the transformer, the nine-dimensional in-air signature signals were concatenated and downsampled to the desired length and then fed into the transformer for time sequence signal multi-classification. The performance of each model on the smartwatch in-air signature dataset was thoroughly tested with respect to 10 optimizers and different learning rates. The best testing performance score in our experiment was 99.8514% with ResNet by using the Adagrad optimizer under a 1×10−4 learning rate.",

What is natural for natural intelligence is still a challenge for AI systems. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible model of spatiotemporal memory with an attractor module and study its ability to encode sequences and efficiently extract and reuse repetitive patterns. The results of experiments on synthetic and textual data and data from DVS cameras demonstrate a qualitative improvement in the properties of the model when using the attractor module.\n",

We also optimize and improve the efficiency of the RC curve, which represents the relationship between risk and coverage in selective classification. Efficiency here means greater coverage for risk and less risk for coverage in the RC curve. We use the model internal representation when time series data is input to SNN, rank the prediction results that are the output, and reject them at an arbitrary rate. We propose multiple methods based on the characteristics of datasets and the architecture of models. Multiple methods, such as a simple method with discrete coverage and a method with continuous and flexible coverage, yielded results that exceeded the performance of the existing method, softmax response.",

        "abstract": "The detection and categorization of brain tumours is now possible because to new technology. The MRI images of individuals who have been diagnosed with Astrocytoma are analyzed by the system, which makes use of an artificial neural network, in order to identify tumour blocks or lesions also to classify the type of tumour. These approaches are described below. The Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) was the tool that made it feasible to characterize the different textures of tumours. A contrast is drawn between each of these traits and those that are already included in the Knowledge Base. Finally, after years of research and development, a Neuro Fuzzy Classifier has been created that is capable of correctly identifying the various subtypes of brain cancer. An initial phase of testing focused on learning and training, followed by a second phase focused on recognizing and assessing, have been carried out on the system in its entirety. The Radiology Department at Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) was kind enough towards supply the training data for the system, which consisted of MRI scans of patients who had already been diagnosed with brain cancer. The method was also validated by using unlabeled MRI image data taken from patients with brain tumours treated at TMH. The classification of these samples and the handling of outliers were both determined to be successfully handled by the system.",

        "abstract": "In the field of behavioral detection, deep learning has been extensively utilized. For example, deep learning models have been utilized to detect and classify malware. Deep learning, however, has vulnerabilities that can be exploited with crafted inputs, resulting in malicious files being misclassified. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) may be compromised by malicious files, which can have catastrophic consequences. This paper presents a method for classifying Windows portable executables (PEs) using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To generate malware executable adversarial examples of PE, we conduct two white-box attacks, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) and Carlini and Wagner attack (C&W). An adversarial payload was injected into the DOS header, and a section was added to the file to preserve the PE functionality. The attacks successfully evaded the CNN model with a 91% evasion rate, whereas the RNN model evaded attacks at an 84.6% rate. Two defense mechanisms based on distillation and training techniques are examined in this study for overcoming adversarial example challenges. Distillation and training against JSMA resulted in the highest reductions in the evasion rates of 48.1% and 41.49%, respectively. Distillation and training against C&W resulted in the highest decrease in evasion rates, at 48.1% and 49.9%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The classification of videos has become increasingly important in the field of data science research, as it has numerous practical applications in modern society. Compared to image classification, video classification poses a significantly greater challenge. One of the most obvious difficulties is that video classification tasks require more powerful computers due to the large number of features that need to be computed. Additionally, conventional 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2D CNNs) are not effective in handling such tasks. This paper proposes a novel 2-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for action recognition that addresses these challenges. The proposed architecture achieved a high test accuracy of 79.66% for classifying large video clips. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for video classification tasks.",

Only in US, more over 700,000 individuals meet ischemic stroke due to blood clot blocking an artery to the brain every year. «Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. »  «Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade. » In the case of subsequent strokes, it is possible to mitigate consequences if physicians can determine stroke etiology. The paper describes particular approach how to apply Artificial Intelligence for purposes of separating two major acute ischemic stroke (AIS) etiology subtypes: cardiac and large artery atherosclerosis.

        "abstract": "\n                        <p>Computer-aided diagnosis of retinopathy is a hot research topic in the field of medical image classification, where optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an important basis for the diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper, two publicly available retinal OCT image datasets are integrated and screened. Then, an end-to-end deep learning algorithmic framework based on CNN-RNN Unified Neural Networks was proposed to automatically and reliably classify six categories of retinal OCT images. Numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm works well in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity, approaching or even partially surpassing the performance of clinical experts. It is valuable in promoting computer-aided diagnosis towards practical clinical applications and improving the efficiency of clinical diagnosis of retinal diseases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    ",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has been used in many places in people's daily life, and there are more and more methods to classify objects by using deep learning. However, at present, the technique of fruit classification is mainly manual classification, and the accuracy of mechanical classification needs to be improved. The ideas for fruit recognition are primarily focused on distinguishing the shape, texture, and colour of fruits. Therefore, this paper uses deep learning technology since the performance of deep learning in the field of computer vision is better than that of traditional machine learning. The convolutional neural network (CNN) of deep learning will automatically learn the features of different fruit images to establish a model for predicting fruit types. In this paper, four CNNs models with different structures are compared with the prediction results for 131 different types of fruit. The data showed that the best model provided 98.2% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The previous multi-layer learning network is easy to fall into local extreme points in supervised learning. If the training samples sufficiently cover future samples, the learned multi-layer weights can be well used to predict new test samples. This paper mainly studies the research and analysis of machine short text sentiment classification based on Bayesian network and deep neural network algorithm. It first introduces Bayesian network and deep neural network algorithms, and analyzes the comments of various social software such as Twitter, Weibo, and other popular emotional communication platforms. Using modeling technology popular reviews are designed to conduct classification research on unigrams, bigrams, parts of speech, dependency labels, and triplet dependencies. The results show that the range of its classification accuracy is the smallest as 0.8116 and the largest as 0.87. These values are obtained when the input nodes of the triple dependency feature are 12,000, and the reconstruction error range of the Boltzmann machine is limited between 7.3175 and 26.5429, and the average classification accuracy is 0.8301. The advantages of triplet dependency features for text representation in text sentiment classification tasks are illustrated. It shows that Bayesian and deep neural network show good advantages in short text emotion classification.",

        "abstract": "AbstractOrbital tumors are the most common eye tumors that affect people all over the world. Early detection prevents the progression to other regions of the eye and the body. Also, early identification and treatment could reduce mortality. A computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system to help physicians diagnose tumors is in great demand in ophthalmology. In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated promising outcomes in computer vision systems. This work proposes a CAD system for detecting various forms of orbital tumors using convolutional neural networks. The system has three stages: preprocessing, data augmentation and classification. The proposed system was evaluated on two datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images containing 1404 MRI T1-weighted images and 1560 MRI T2-weighted images. The results have shown that the system is capable of detecting and classifying the tumor in each image type, and the recognition rate for the T1-weighted image is 98% and for the T2-weighted image is 97%.",

In particular, we constructed two classes of neural network-based models: shallow–dense neural networks with one hidden layer and deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers. Furthermore, several advanced approaches were explored, including the combined actuarial neural network approach, embeddings and transfer learning. The model training was achieved by minimizing either the deviance or the cross-entropy loss functions, leading to fourteen neural network-based models in total. For illustrative purposes, logistic regression and the alternative neural network-based models we propose are employed for a binary classification exercise concerning the occurrence of at least one claim in a French motor third-party insurance portfolio. Finally, the model interpretability issue was addressed via the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations approach.",

        "abstract": "Different types of wood defects correspond to different processing methods. Good classification means can transform defective boards into practical boards after appropriate processing. The detection accuracy of the wood surface defects is particularly important for improving the utilization rate and speed of processing the boards. The RegNet stands out in the field of computer vision. It automatically designs the network model based on the design space and applies it to wood defect detection, which can improve the classification accuracy. When the convolutional structure of the RegNet network is applied to industrial detection and classification, the problems of long real-time detection time and large algorithm parameters persist. This study focuses on collecting wood material images of common coniferous and broad-leaved trees in Northeast China with three types of defects: wormholes, slip knots, and dead knots. To improve the allocation of computing resources, based on the RegNet network model, an attention mechanism module was added, and the Ghostconv structure was introduced. The structure quickly and accurately highlighted the types of wood defects, improved the classification accuracy, reduced the parameters of the network, and exhibited generalization ability. To verify the performance of the improved network, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet, and Vision-Transformer networks were introduced for comparative analysis. The improved RegNet network had smaller weight and higher accuracy, with a classification accuracy of 96.58%.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is a chronic disease which threatens the global human health. Over time it could lead to other serious medical problems and does not have a permanent cure. Hence if we could diagnose or predict it early, then it might be possible to prevent it. Several researches have shown that computer technology can effectively assist in the diagnosis of diseases. And neural network could be used for classification and prediction. In order to identify the most significant element that has the greatest impact on the classification and prediction, this paper applies artificial neural networks to the PIMA Indian diabetes dataset. This study's neural network is a fully connected neural network. We used the fully connected neural network discussed above to the dataset that deleted one factor column per time, and we compared their accuracy to determine which factor was the most significant in this dataset. Finally, this study discovers that \"Glucose\" level, followed by \"BMI,\" is the most crucial component for diabetes in this dataset, with a fully connected neural network having an accuracy of 84%.",

        "abstract": "Mail classification methods based on machine learning have been introduced to combat spams. However, few researches focus on the most powerful machine learning model that is neural networks. In this paper, the author trains BP neural networks to detect spams. The inputs of the neural networks are only information about words, punctures, signs, numbers and illegal words. Five neural networks which are different in number of neurons and number of layers are experimented on. All networks apply Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) functions and Momentum learning technology. The results show that the network with four hidden layers enjoys the best classifying accuracy of 97.0%. In networks with two hidden layers, when the number of neurons in each layer is above 300, the accuracy is between 95.5% and 96.0%; and 100 neurons in each layer result in an accuracy of 93.8%. Although the training only captures information of words, punctures and signs, the networks have achieved high accuracy, and the author suggests that making the computer understand sentences as well as other kinds of improvements can lead to even higher performance.",

        "abstract": "AbstractReal-world sound signals exhibit various aspects of grouping and profiling behaviors, such as being recorded from identical sources, having similar environmental settings, or encountering related background noises. In this work, we propose novel neural profiling networks (NeuProNet) capable of learning and extracting high-level unique profile representations from sounds. An end-to-end framework is developed so that any backbone architectures can be plugged in and trained, achieving better performance in any downstream sound classification tasks. We introduce an in-batch profile grouping mechanism based on profile awareness and attention pooling to produce reliable and robust features with contrastive learning. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and tasks to show that neural computing models under the guidance of our framework gain significant performance gaps across all evaluation tasks. Particularly, the integration of NeuProNet surpasses recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) approaches on UrbanSound8K and VocalSound datasets with statistically significant improvements in benchmarking metrics, up to 5.92% in accuracy compared to the previous SoTA method and up to 20.19% compared to baselines. Our work provides a strong foundation for utilizing neural profiling for machine learning tasks.",

Researchers have developed numerous methods for achieving image classification through long-term research. Deep Learning, as one of the most important methodologies, is used to clarify the contents of an image. This paper provides an overview of four typical deep learning neural networks used for image classification, including conventional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), and deep neural networks (DNN). The architecture, function, and applications of each network are discussed and compared. CNN is commonly used for image recognition, while RNN is suitable for speech recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. DNN is ideal for handling high-dimensional data, and GAN can generate new data samples. The StyleGAN is introduced as an application of GAN, which can produce high-quality images. Finally, the future work and challenges in image recognition are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification is an important component in many modern aeronautical communication systems to achieve efficient spectrum usage in congested wireless environments and other communications systems applications. In recent years, numerous convolutional deep learning architectures have been proposed for automatically classifying the modulation used on observed signal bursts. However, a comprehensive analysis of these differing architectures and the importance of each design element has not been carried out. Thus, it is unclear what trade-offs the differing designs of these convolutional neural networks might have. In this research, we investigate numerous architectures for automatic modulation classification and perform a comprehensive ablation study to investigate the impacts of varying hyperparameters and design elements on automatic modulation classification accuracy. We show that a new state-of-the-art accuracy can be achieved using a subset of the studied design elements, particularly as applied to modulation classification over intercepted bursts of varying time duration. In particular, we show that a combination of dilated convolutions, statistics pooling, and squeeze-and-excitation units results in the strongest performing classifier achieving 98.9% peak accuracy and 63.7% overall accuracy on the RadioML 2018.01A dataset. We further investigate this best performer according to various other criteria, including short signal bursts of varying length, common misclassifications, and performance across differing modulation categories and modes.",

        "abstract": "Generally, the filtration of non-recyclable garbage is conducted in order to make a material recycling process  efficient. However, this filtration task is very time-consuming and costly, since it is generally done manually. Thus,  it is significantly considered that an automation technique is necessary in solving this problem. There have been a  number of attempts to resolve this problem. The previous methods used the shallow convolutional neural network to  compose their network. However, these methods tend to display poor accuracy, which makes it impossible to be  applied in real-life situations. To solve this problem, I propose a novel category-aware recycle classification system.  The proposed system is composed of three models, which are garbage feature extractor, garbage classifier, and  recycle classifier. The input image is fed to the garbage feature extractor and then converted into feature maps. The  feature maps are then fed to each the garbage classifier and the recycle classifier. The garbage classifier predicts the  category of the input garbage image while the recycle classifier determines if the input is recyclable or not. Through  experiments, the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods by a maximum 20.2% difference  in accuracy on Garbage Classification and Industrial and Residential Waste datasets.",

        "abstract": "As the total number of birds has declined in the billions over the last 50 years, an accurate method for classifying bird species is necessary for conservation efforts and population monitoring. One promising method is using machine learning models to classify birds by their sounds, which has emerged due to benefits such as being less affected by environmental factors (eg. habitat, time of day), and lower disturbances to bird species during the data collection process, contrary to other processes such as image classification. As audio processing may eventually become the main method of classifying birds and may be used as an important conservation tool, it is imperative to understand the challenges that must be overcome before it can be successfully applied. In this work, the programming language Python and the machine learning model Convolutional Neural Networks were used to process and classify audio recordings from over 150 different bird species. This study demonstrates that although audio classification is a promising method of classification, many challenges are still present in the field, such as the amount of variety in the different calls of a single bird, the presence of background noises in many audio recordings, and the difficulty in efficiently representing an audio signal with images, highlighting the importance of overcoming these challenges for conservation efforts. ",

        "abstract": "Galaxy morphology classification is essential for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies. However, previous studies based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) mainly focused on the structure of convolutional layers without exploring the designs of fully connected layers. In this regard, this paper trains and compares the performance of CNNs with 4 types of fully connected layers on the Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset. Each type of the fully connected layers contains one dropout layer, and dropout rates including 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% are tested in the experiment to investigate how dropout rates in fully connected layers can affect the overall performance of CNNs. Meanwhile, these models utilize the EfficientNetB0 and DensnNet121 as their feature extraction networks. During the training process, feature-wise standardization, morphological operations, and data argumentation are used for preprocessing. Technics including class weights, exponential learning rate decay, and early stopping are applied to improve model performance. Saliency maps and Grad-CAM are also used to interpret model behaviours. Results show that the architectures of fully connected layers have a significant effect on models overall performance. With the same dropout rate and convolutional layers, models using global average pooling and an additional dense layer outperform others in most cases. The best model obtained an accuracy of 85.23% on test set. Meanwhile, the experimental results on dropout indicate that dropout layer can reduce the effect of the architectures of fully connected layers on overall performance of some CNNs, leading to better performance with less parameters.",

        "abstract": "With the popularity of artificial intelligence, the use of deep learning is more and more extensive, but devices often need good performance to complete this task. However, for mobile devices and some devices with relatively poor performance, deep learning seems to have many obstacles. So, this article explores lightweight neural networks. I used two datasets to explore the problem of using lightweight neural networks to classify images. One is the issue of binary classification, which uses gender data sets. The other is the multi-classification problem, which uses bird data sets. I compared three models, one of which is a relatively complex neural network, and the other two are respectively MobileNet and ShuffleNet.In the first dataset, that is, the binary classification problem, the relatively complex neural network performs well, and the accuracy reaches 0.93. However, the accuracy of MobileNet with pre-training parameters and ShuffleNet without pre-training parameters also reached 0.86 and 0.84 respectively. Although the accuracy is reduced, it also shows that the lightweight neural network can well complete this problem. In the multi-classification problem, the relatively complex network performance has been greatly reduced. The accuracy is only 0.76, which may be due to the limited ability of standard convolution to process information. The accuracy of MobileNet with pre-training parameters is 0.87, and the accuracy of ShuffleNet without pre-training parameters is 0.62. So, the conclusion is that using lightweight neural networks should pay attention to the complexity of the problem, whether to use pre-training parameters and the selection of parameters.",

It is influencing all steps of plant production and forcing farmers to change and adapt their crop management practices using new technologies based on data analytics. This study aims to classify plant diseases based on images collected directly in the field using deep learning. To this end, an ensemble learning paradigm is investigated to build a robust network in order to predict four different pear leaf diseases. Several convolutional neural network architectures, named EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and VGG19, were compared and ensembled to improve the predictive performance by adopting the bagging strategy and weighted averaging. Quantitative experiments were conducted to evaluate the model on the DiaMOS Plant dataset, a self-collected dataset in the field. Data augmentation was adopted to improve the generalization of the model. The results, evaluated with a range of metrics, including accuracy, recall, precison and f1-score, showed that the proposed ensemble convolutional neural network outperformed the single convolutional neural network in classifying diseases in real field-condition with variation in brightness, disease similarity, complex background, and multiple leaves.",

        "abstract": "Tomatoes are one of the world’s greatest valuable vegetables and are regarded as the economic pillar of numerous countries. Nevertheless, these harvests remain susceptible to a variety of illnesses which can reduce and destroy the generation of healthy crops, making early and precise identification of these diseases critical. Therefore, in recent years, numerous studies have utilized deep learning (DL) models for automatic tomato leaf illness identification. However, many of these methods are based on a single DL architecture that needs a high computational ability to update these hyperparameters leading to a rise in the classification complexity. In addition, they extracted large dimensions from these networks which added to the classification complication. Therefore, this study proposes a pipeline for the automatic identification of tomato leaf diseases utilizing three compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It employs transfer learning to retrieve deep features out of the final fully connected layer of the CNNs for more condensed and high-level representation. Next, it merges features from the three CNNs to benefit from every CNN structure. Subsequently, it applies a hybrid feature selection approach to select and generate a comprehensive feature set of lower dimensions. Six classifiers are utilized in the tomato leaf illnesses identification procedure. The results indicate that the K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine have attained the highest accuracy of 99.92% and 99.90% using 22 and 24 features only. The experimental results of the proposed pipeline are also compared with previous research studies for tomato leaf diseases classification which verified its competing capacity.",

        "abstract": "Most studies in graph theory assume that graphs are static, but in reality, graph structures and features change over time, leading to the concept of dynamic graphs, which is an under-researched area. Contemporary research in dynamic graph representation learning typically treats different snapshots of the graph as separate entities, disregarding the benefits of incorporating temporal information. While some techniques try to solve this problem using recurrent neural network-based solutions, these approaches still face the challenge of the vanishing or exploding gradient problem and complicated training procedures. To address these issues, we propose DynamicG2B, a BiLSTM-based graph neural architecture that computes node representations guided by attention using neighborhood aggregation. Our method applies relevant attention weights at different time steps to classify nodes in a supervised manner, utilizing dynamic edges and node feature information. Our evaluation of two benchmark datasets shows that DynamicG2B outperforms seven state-of-the-art baseline models in node classification in dynamic graphs. Additionally, our analysis of attention weights opens up opportunities for further research into exploring the importance of relationships among graph nodes.",

        "abstract": "In brain–computer interface (BCI) systems, motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) signals are commonly used to detect participant intent. Many factors, including low signal-to-noise ratios and few high-quality samples, make MI classification difficult. In order for BCI systems to function, MI-EEG signals must be studied. In pattern recognition and other fields, deep learning approaches have recently been successfully applied. In contrast, few effective deep learning algorithms have been applied to BCI systems, especially MI-based systems. In this paper, we address these problems from two aspects based on the characteristics of EEG signals: first, we proposed a combined time–frequency domain data enhancement method. This method guarantees that the size of the training data is effectively increased while maintaining the intrinsic composition of the data. Second, our design consists of a parallel CNN that takes both raw EEG images and images transformed through continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as inputs. We conducted classification experiments on a public data set to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. According to experimental results based on the BCI Competition IV Dataset2a, the average classification accuracy is 97.61%. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms shows that it performs better in classification. The algorithm can be used to improve the classification performance of MI-based BCIs and BCI systems created for people with disabilities.",

Aiming at the problem that network training usually requires the support of a large number of labeled samples, an image classification model based on semi-supervised deep learning is proposed, which uses labeled samples to guide the network to learn unlabeled samples. A convolutional neural network model for simultaneous processing of labeled and unlabeled data is constructed. The tagged data is used to train the Softmax classifier and provide the initial K-means clustering center for the untagged data. The nonsubsampling contourlet layer is used to replace the first convolutional layer of the full convolutional neural network to extract multi-scale depth features, and the nonsubsampling contourlet full convolutional neural network is constructed. The network can extract multi-scale information of the images to be classified, and extract more discriminative deep image features. In addition, the parameters of the nonsubsampled contourlet layers are pre-set and do not require network training. The proposed method has higher classification accuracy than the contrast method on polarimetric SAR images using the nonsubsampled contourlet full convolutional neural network. ",

        "abstract": "Deep learning, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques, has been shown to have superior performance in ship classification, as have small-target recognition studies in safety inspections of hydraulic structures such as ports and dams. High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based maritime ship classification plays an increasingly important role in marine surveillance, marine rescue, and maritime ship management. To improve ship classification accuracy and training efficiency, we proposed a CNN-based ship classification method. Firstly, the image characteristics of different ship structures and the materials of ship SAR images were analyzed. We then constructed a ship SAR image dataset and performed preprocessing operations such as averaging. Combined with a classic neural network structure, we created a new convolutional module, namely, the Inception-Residual Controller (IRC) module. A convolutional neural network was built based on the IRC module to extract image features and establish a ship classification model. Finally, we conducted simulation experiments for ship classification and analyzed the experimental results for comparison. The experimental results showed that the average accuracy of ship classification of the model in this paper reached 98.71%, which was approximately 3% more accurate than the traditional network model and approximately 1% more accurate compared with other recently improved models. The new module also performed well in evaluation metrics, such as the recall rate, with accurate classifications. The model could satisfactorily describe different ship types. Therefore, it could be applied to marine ship classification management with the possibility of being extended to hydraulic building target recognition tasks.",

It is possible to classify the grain polymorphism of barley cultivars, which are economically important among cereal crops, in a short time with computer vision methods with high accuracy rate and almost zero cost. In this research, a novel image database consisting of 2800 images were created to classify 14 barley cultivars. Six different deep convolutional neural network models were designed based on a transfer learning method with pretrained DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, DenseNet-201, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2 and Xception networks. The models were trained and evaluated with test-time augmentation method, the best performance was obtained from DenseNet-169 model with average 96.07% recall, 96.29% precision, 96.07% F1-score, and 96.07% accuracy on a test set independent of the training set. The results showed that the transfer learning method performed using additional layers such as dropout and data augmentation with sufficient data samples in these images with high similarities prevented overfitting by increasing the model performance. As a result, it can be suggested that the provided web tool based on the transfer model has an encouraging performance in identifying seedswith a high number of cultivars such as barley. ",
