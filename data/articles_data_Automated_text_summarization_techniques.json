        "abstract": "Techniques that employ natural language processing (NLP), often known as text summarizing, automatically construct summaries of extensive texts. Extractive and abstractive summarization are two main categories that may be used to classify these methods. In extractive summarizing, the most significant lines or phrases from a text are isolated and used to generate a summary. On the other hand, in abstractive summarization, a summary is generated that is clear, short, and accurate in its representation of the text's primary concepts. NLP methods like sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and semantic analysis are used in generating a summary from a text and locating and extracting relevant information from the text. Text summarizing is a subject that has received a significant amount of study and has applications in various fields, including the summation of news articles, documents, and emails, among other things.",

        "abstract": "n proposed work, we successfully implemented a news text summarization system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) algorithm. The purpose of our project was to extract important information from a large volume of news articles and present it in a concise and easily understandable manner. To achieve this, we utilized the LSA algorithm, which is known for its ability to capture the underlying semantic structure of text. LSA employs a mathematical model to analyse relationships between words in a document, creating a semantic representation where words with similar contexts are grouped together in a vector space. The LSA-based summarization process involved several steps. First, we pre-processed the news articles by removing stop words, punctuation, and other non-relevant elements. Then, we constructed a term-document matrix, where rows represented words and columns represented documents, with matrix values representing word frequencies. Next, we applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the term-document matrix. SVD helped reduce the matrix's dimensionality by identifying the most important latent semantic concepts. This resulted in a lower-dimensional representation that captured the essential information. Finally, we identified the most important sentences in the news articles by measuring the cosine similarity between each sentence and the summary. Sentences with the highest cosine similarity scores were selected as summary sentences. The proposed system demonstrated the effectiveness of the LSA algorithm for news text summarization. By capturing the semantic structure of the text, it generated summaries that allowed users to understand the key points of a news article quickly and easily. Our implementation had practical applications for content recommendation systems, news aggregation platforms, and personalized news feeds. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the LSA algorithm. It may struggle with handling idiomatic expressions and can be sensitive to the quality of the input data. These considerations highlight the need for ongoing research and development to enhance the performance and robustness of news text summarization systems.",

        "abstract": "Due to the enormous content of text available online through emails, social media, and news articles, it has become complicated to summarize the textual information from multiple documents. Text summarization automatically creates a comprehensive description of the document that retains its informative contents through the keywords, where Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is a productive tool for data accumulation that creates a concise and informative summary from the documents. In order to extract the relevant information from the documents, Graph neural networks (GNNs) is the neural structure that detains the interrelation of the graph by progressing the messages between the graphical nodes. In the current years, the advanced version of GNNs, such as graph attention network (GAN), graph recurrent network, and graph convolutional network (GCN) provides a remarkable performance in text summarization with the advantage of deep learning techniques. Hence, in this survey, graph approaches for text summarization has been analyzed and discussed, where the recent text summarization model based on Deep learning techniques are highlighted. Further, the article provides the taxonomy to abstract the design pattern of Neural Networks and conducts a comprehensive of the existing text summarization model. Finally, the review article enlists the future direction of the researcher, which would motivate the enthusiastic and novel contributions in text summarizations.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in technology have enabled the storage of voluminous data. As this data is abundant, there is a need to create summaries that would capture the relevant details of the original source. Since manual summarization is a very taxing process, researchers have been actively trying to automate this process using modern computers that could try to comprehend and generate natural human language. Automated text summarization has been one of the most researched areas in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Extractive and abstractive summarization are two of the most commonly used techniques for generating summaries. In this study, we present a new methodology that takes the aforementioned summarization techniques into consideration and based on the input, generates a summary that is seemingly better than that generated using a single approach. Further, we have made an attempt to provide this methodology as a service that is deployed on the internet and is remotely accessible from anywhere. This service provided is scalable, fully responsive, and configurable. Next, we also discuss the evaluation process through which we came up with the best model out of many candidate models. Lastly, we conclude by discussing the inferences that we gained out of this study and provide a brief insight into future directions that we could explore.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical text summarization (BTS) is proving to be an emerging area of work and research with the need for sustainable healthcare applications such as evidence-based medicine practice (EBM) and telemedicine which help effectively support healthcare needs of the society. However, with the rapid growth in the biomedical literature and the diversities in its structure and resources, it is becoming challenging to carry out effective text summarization for better insights. The goal of this work is to conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review of significant and high-impact literary work in BTS with a deep understanding of its major artifacts such as databases, semantic similarity measures, and semantic enrichment approaches. In the systematic literature review conducted, we applied search filters to find high-impact literature in the biomedical text summarization domain from IEEE, SCOPUS, Elsevier, EBSCO, and PubMed databases. The systematic literature review (SLR) yielded 81 works; those were analyzed for qualitative study. The in-depth study of the literature shows the relevance and efficacy of the deep learning (DL) approach, context-aware feature extraction techniques, and their relevance in BTS. Biomedical question answering (BQA) system is one of the most popular applications of text summarizations for building self-sufficient healthcare systems and are pointing to future research directions. The review culminates in realization of a proposed framework for the BQA system MEDIQA with design of better heuristics for content screening, document screening, and relevance ranking. The presented framework provides an evidence-based biomedical question answering model and text summarizer that can lead to real-time evidence-based clinical support system to healthcare practitioners.",

It is a challenging task for human beings to manually summarize extensive documents due to the time required and cognitive effort involved. The increasing amount of textual data generated in recent years has led to a greater demand for efficient and automated text summarization methods. This study explores the utilization of deep learning and neural network concepts to create an automatic abstractive text summarization system for product reviews using multi-dimensional long short-term memory. Since, reading product reviews can be a time-consuming task, especially given the abundance and diversity of reviews written by numerous individuals. The proposed model was evaluated by comparing the generated summaries to reference summaries using metrics such as Rouge. Further, the performance of the model is compared with the prevalent state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed Multi-Dimensional LSTM model was evaluated using the Amazon food review dataset and compared with four other text summarization methods. The proposed model outperformed the prevalent models in terms of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores but was slightly outperformed in terms of the ROUGE-2 score.",

        "abstract": "The increasing amount of legal information available online is overwhelming for both citizens and legal professionals, making it difficult and time-consuming to find relevant information and keep up with the latest legal developments. Automatic text summarization techniques can be highly beneficial as they save time, reduce costs, and lessen the cognitive load of legal professionals. However, applying these techniques to legal documents poses several challenges due to the complexity of legal documents and the lack of needed resources, especially in linguistically under-resourced languages, such as the Greek language. In this paper, we address automatic summarization of Greek legal documents. A major challenge in this area is the lack of suitable datasets in the Greek language. In response, we developed a new metadata-rich dataset consisting of selected judgments from the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece, alongside their reference summaries and category tags, tailored for the purpose of automated legal document summarization. We also adopted several state-of-the-art methods for abstractive and extractive summarization and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the methods using both human and automatic metrics. Our results: (i) revealed that, while extractive methods exhibit average performance, abstractive methods generate moderately fluent and coherent text, but they tend to receive low scores in relevance and consistency metrics; (ii) indicated the need for metrics that capture better a legal document summaryâs coherence, relevance, and consistency; (iii) demonstrated that fine-tuning BERT models on a specific upstream task can significantly improve the modelâs performance.",

In the shortest possible time to find relevant and useful information, it is for sure very helpful if the information is summarized, but it typically requires a lot of effort, dedication, patience, and attention to detail for humans to go through and summarize the lengthy texts. This can be done using automated abstractive text summarization techniques by using deep learning which is the way of selecting the most significant information in a text, then condensing it while maintaining its underlying meaning. The objective is to construct an abstractive text summarizer using deep learning. It takes large meaning-full text data as input and gives the summary of the data as output. The algorithm which is been used here is the Long Short Term Memory model (LSTM) which is a type of RNN model. And then next the model which is been used is the Sequence to Sequence model (Seq2Seq). Seq2Seq learning is the training model that can modify the sequences of one input into the sequences of another output. The dataset used is News Summary dataset which is taken from Kaggle. Experimental results on the news summary dataset show that the proposed method results are appropriate and match with the other methods.",

        "abstract": "With the advancement of the internet, humanity has gained easy access to a plethora of information. However, to access accurate content, numerous texts and sources must be read. These texts often contain repetitive words and sentences. The abundance of information renders reading texts in their entirety inefficient in terms of time and makes finding suitable content challenging. To overcome these difficulties, various methods have been developed in research on automatic summarization. In the literature, there are numerous methods developed for different purposes in text summarization. Nevertheless, text summarization can generally be divided into two distinct categories: extractive and abstractive summarization. Abstractive algorithms tend to create new sentences by learning from the text. However, this approach prolongs the working process due to the learning phase and the generated sentences may not possess absolute accuracy. On the other hand, extractive methods, if unable to generate new sentences, have the ability to provide faster and completely accurate summaries by selecting sentences that already exist in the text. For these reasons, in our study, the aim is to perform text summarization using graph theory and the Malatya Centrality Algorithm. The Malatya Centrality Algorithm offers a polynomial approach to solving Vertex Cover Problems and is regarded as an effective solution method. It is believed that the Malatya Centrality Algorithm will contribute to graph-based text summarization. The implementation has been developed using the Python programming language, and the obtained results have been evaluated.",

        "abstract": "Text summarization techniques offer a way to address the significant challenges faced by clinicians and researchers due to the exponential growth of information in healthcare on the internet. By condensing lengthy text into concise summaries, these techniques facilitate faster, easier, and convenient access to relevant information. This is particularly beneficial in use cases such as online user feedback/reviews about drugs, where valuable insights can be obtained that extend beyond clinical trials and observational studies. This paper comprehensively evaluates six widely used text summarization techniques (LSA, Luhnâs Method, Text Rank, T5 Transformer, and Kullback-Leibler, BERT) in extracting key insights, themes and patterns about drugs from online drug reviews. The evaluation considers both quantitative and qualitative aspects, focusing on their applicability to the challenging medical terminology, which is known for its inherent intricacies and complexities. The findings of this study showed the performance of text summarization techniques using metrics such as F1 score, Recall, and Precision, focused on the unigram, bigram, and trigram overlap between the generated text summaries and the reference summaries, utilizing the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L evaluation methods. It is shown that results showed TextRank to be the most effective text summarization method followed by BERT when working with Medical Terminology in Healthcare & Biomedical Informatics, given its complex hierarchy and extensive vocabulary of medical terms.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is one of the utilizations of technological sophistication in terms of text processing assisting humans in producing a summary or key points of a document in large quantities. We use Indonesian language as objects because there are few resources in NLP research using Indonesian language. This paper utilized PLTMs (Pre-Trained Language Models) from the transformer architecture, namely T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) which has been completed previously with a larger dataset. Evaluation in this study was measured through comparison of the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) calculation results between the reference summary and the model summary. The experiments with the pre-trained t5-base model with fine tuning parameters of 220M for the Indonesian news dataset yielded relatively high ROUGE values, namely ROUGE-1 = 0.68, ROUGE-2 = 0.61, and ROUGE-L = 0.65. The evaluation value worked well, but the resulting model has not achieved satisfactory results because in terms of abstraction, the model did not work optimally. We also found several errors in the reference summary in the dataset used.",

        "abstract": "Online learning text summarization is vital for managing the constant influx of online information. It involves condensing lengthy online content into concise summaries while retaining the original meaning and information. While several online summarization tools are available, they often fall short in preserving the underlying semantics of the text. In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach to online text summarization that strongly emphasizes capturing and preserving the semantics of the text. Our automatic summarizer leverages distributional semantic models to extract and incorporate semantics, producing high-quality online summaries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our online summarization system, we conducted experiments on a diverse range of online content. We employed ROUGE metrics, a popular evaluation method for text summarization, to assess our system's performance. Additionally, we compared our results with those of four state-of-the-art online summarizers. The outcome of our study demonstrates that our online summarization approach, which integrates semantics as a fundamental feature, outperforms other reference summarizers. This conclusion underscores the significance of leveraging semantics in the context of online learning text summarization. Furthermore, our system's ability to reduce redundancies in online content makes it a valuable tool for managing information overload in the digital age.",

        "abstract": "Extractive text summarization involves the retention of only the most important sentences in a document. In the past, multiple approaches involving both statistical and machine learning-based methods have been used for this task. The crucial step in extractive text summarization is getting the right ranking order of sentences in the document in terms of their importance. Singular value decomposition or SVD algorithm based on latent semantic analysis focuses on recognizing the sections in the document which are related in terms of their semantic nature. Fuzzy algorithms involve reasoning of the priority order of the sentences using fuzzy logic unlike the use of discrete values. While significant work has been done for extractive text summarization in English and other foreign languages, there is ample scope for improving the performance of systems when dealing with Marathi text. In this paper, SVD and fuzzy algorithms are proposed for performing extractive text summarization on Marathi documents. Work is done upon the modeling principle, data flow, and parameters of these algorithms such that they are best suited for the task. An analysis of the characteristics of both these techniques is conducted to compare their benefits and shortcomings. The performance of both the algorithms is evaluated on a document dataset using standard performance metrics including the ROUGE metric. An unbiased comparison of both these techniques is carried out to inform the applicability of them, especially when working with Marathi or in general, non-English text.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, individuals can be overwhelmed by a huge number of documents being present in daily life. Capturing the necessary details is often a challenge. Therefore, it is rather important to summarize documents to obtain the main information quickly. There currently exist automatic approaches to this task, but their quality is often not properly assessed. State-of-the-art metrics rely on human-generated summaries as a reference for the evaluation. If no reference is given, the assessment will be challenging. Therefore, in the absence of human-generated reference summaries, we investigated an alternative approach to how machine-generated summaries can be evaluated. For this, we focus on the original text or document to retrieve a metric that allows a direct evaluation of automatically generated summaries. This approach is particularly helpful in cases where it is difficult or costly to find reference summaries. In this paper, we present a novel metric called Summary Score without ReferenceâSUSWIRâwhich is based on four factors already known in the text summarization community: Semantic Similarity, Redundancy, Relevance, and Bias Avoidance Analysis, overcoming drawbacks of common metrics. Therefore, we aim to close a gap in the current evaluation environment for machine-generated text summaries. The novel metric is introduced theoretically and tested on five datasets from their respective domains. The conducted experiments yielded noteworthy outcomes, employing the utilization of SUSWIR.",

        "abstract": "With the noteworthy expansion of textual data sources in recent years, easy, quick, and precise text processing has become a challenge for key qualifiers. Automatic text summarization is the process of squeezing text documents into shorter summaries to facilitate verification of their basic contents, which must be completed without losing vital information and features. The most difficult information retrieval task is text summarization, particularly for Arabic. In this research, we offer an automatic, general, and extractive Arabic single document summarizing approach with the goal of delivering a sufficiently informative summary. The proposed model is based on a textual graph to generate a coherent summary. Firstly, the original text is converted to a textual graph using a novel formulation that takes into account sentence relevance, coverage, and diversity to evaluate each sentence using a mix of statistical and semantic criteria. Next, a sub-graph is built to reduce the size of the original text. Finally, unwanted and less weighted phrases are removed from the summarized sentences to generate a final summary. We used Recall-Oriented Research to Evaluate Main Idea (RED) as an evaluative metric to review our proposed technique and compare it with the most advanced methods. Finally, a trial on the Essex Arabic Summary Corpus (EASC) using the ROUGE index showed promising results compared with the currently available methods.",

The idea is to developinsightful and personalised evaluations that capture the spirit and sentiment of a film.Abstractive text summarization is an Natural language processing (NLP) techniqueof generating new and brief summary of source text data. It generates new lines in summary of text data which are relevant to the original lines. Abstractive summarization yields a numberof applications in different domains, from books and literature, to scienceand R&D, to financial research and legal documents analysis. This project introduces a fresh method for generating personalized movie reviews using abstractive text summarization. The approach employs a BERT-based encoder-decoder model, trained onuser reviews enriched with movieratings. This enables the model to create reviews that are not only informative and captivating but also match the user's preferences. By merging NLP and user preferences, we provide summaries that offer insights into reviewswhile aligning with the user's cinematic likes. In the era of abundant online content, our personalized summarization technique is a valuable tool for helping users navigate movie-related information.

There are numerous locations where one can find textual information sources, including blogs, news portals, and websites. Kompas, BBC, Liputan 6, CNN, and other news portals are a few websites that offer news in Indonesian. The purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using mBART in text summarization for Bahasa Indonesia.Methods: This study uses mBART, a transformer architecture, to perform fine-tuning to generate news article summaries in Bahasa Indonesia. Evaluation was conducted using the ROUGE method to assess the quality of the summaries produced.Results: Evaluation using the ROUGE metric showed better results, with ROUGE-1 of 35.94, ROUGE-2 of 16.43, and ROUGE-L of 29.91. However, the performance of the model is still not optimal compared to existing models in text summarization for another language.Novelty: The novelty of this research lies in the use of mBART for text summarization, specifically adapted for Bahasa Indonesia. In addition, the findings also contribute to understanding the challenges and opportunities of improving text summarization techniques in the Indonesian context.",

        "abstract": "The tremendous increase in documents available on the Web has turned finding the relevant pieces of information into a challenging, tedious, and time-consuming activity. Text summarization is an important natural language processing (NLP) task used to reduce the reading requirements of text. Automatic text summarization is an NLP task that consists of creating a shorter version of a text document which is coherent and maintains the most relevant information of the original text. In recent years, automatic text summarization has received significant attention, as it can be applied to a wide range of applications such as the extraction of highlights from scientific papers or the generation of summaries of news articles. In this research project, we are focused mainly on abstractive text summarization that extracts the most important contents from a text in a rephrased form. The main purpose of this project is to summarize texts in German. Unfortunately, most pretrained models are only available for English. We therefore focused on the German BERT multilingual model and the BART monolingual model for English, with a consideration of translation possibilities. As the source of the experiment setup, took the German Wikipedia article dataset and compared how well the multilingual model performed for German text summarization when compared to using machine-translated text summaries from monolingual English language models. We used the ROUGE-1 metric to analyze the quality of the text summarization.",

        "abstract": "Automatic text summarization is a subarea of natural language processing that generates a summary of the text by keeping its key points. The research work done on summarizing low-resourced language text is very limited. In India, the Hindi language is being spoken by central and north Indian people and only a few research works have been done on abstractive summarization of Hindi language. Having matras in Hindi makes it difficult to tokenize so it is difficult to summarize Hindi text using abstractive text summarization. In the proposed method, abstractive Hindi text summarization is done using transliteration and fine-tuning. In this work, the model is trained to generate both summaries and headlines. ROUGE-score and BERT-score have been utilized to check summary quality. A new semantic similarity score-based performance measure is also proposed to measure semantic similarity between reference summaries and predicted summaries. Using the proposed method, we have achieved the highest 55.16 ROUGE score, 0.80 BERT score, and 0.98 similarity score. Along with these performance measures, human evaluation of predicted summaries is also done and it is found that summaries and headlines were generated at a human-acceptable level.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Our research paper presents an AI text summarization system that utilizes GPT, a powerful language model, to generate concise and meaningful summaries of lengthy text documents. The system consists of four modules: User, Android Application, GPT API, and GPT server. The User interacts with the system through the Android Application, which serves as the user interface. The GPT API acts as the intermediary between the Android Application and the GPT server, which hosts the GPT model and handles the text summarization process. The system employs state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to generate summaries while preserving contextual coherence and salient information. The system's summarization capabilities are evaluated using metrics such as Rouge and F1 scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing key information from different types of text documents. The system's integration with Android platforms provides convenient access for mobile users, making it suitable for applications such as news summarization, document summarization, and content curation. The modular architecture of the system allows for scalability and flexibility, enabling future enhancements and extensions. Our AI text summarization system utilizing GPT presents a promising approach for automatically summarizing large volumes of text, providing users with time-saving and meaningful summaries. The system has potential applications in various domains and can serve as a foundation for further research in the field of text summarization and natural language processing",

        "abstract": "Â \nAn automatic text summarization system mimics how humans summarize by picking the most âsignificant sentences in a source text. However, the complexities of the Arabic language have become âchallenging to obtain information quickly and effectively. The main disadvantage of the âtraditional approaches is that they are strictly constrained (especially for the Arabic language) by the âaccuracy of sentence feature âfunctions, weighting schemes, âand similarity calculations. On the other hand, the meta-heuristic search approaches have a feature that tolerates imprecision, gets âprohibited results, and is not strictly bound by the above ârestrictions. This âpaper used the Gravitational Optimization Algorithm (GOA), a powerful metaheuristic âapproach âbased on the law of âgravity, to address the challenge of extractive summarizing Arabic texts. The objective function of the GOA algorithm is derived based on sentence significance, such as its length, âsimilarity degree, position, statistical term frequency, and named entity ownership. Essex Arabic âSummaries Corpus (EASC) was used to evaluate the proposed method and measured by the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE). The proposed approach achieved 68.04% Recall, ââ58.49% Precision, and 60.05% F1-measure using ROUGE-1, higher than standard summarizers and metaheuristic approaches",

        "abstract": "Text summarization is a key strategy in the domains of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP). Its objective is to reduce a lengthy written document into a clearer, more succinct summary of the information it contains. When a text document is too lengthy or intricate to analyse completely, as in news stories, academic papers, or legal documents, this approach is extremely helpful. The major challenge of text summarising is to take the most important and relevant information from the original text and convey it in an understandable and concise way. In this study, extractive and abstractive summarising techniques are the two primary categories of text summary methods. The paper also presents several algorithms that have been proposed for text summarization, including TextRank, Seq2Seq, and BART. TextRank is a simple and fast algorithm that works well for short documents, Seq2Seq is a deep learning-based approach that generates high-quality summaries, and BART is a transformer-based algorithm that provides the best results on benchmark datasets. The obtained ROUGE Score after passing TextRank, BART, and Seq2SEq algorithm significant also.",

        "abstract": "For over a decade, online job portals have been providing their services to both job seekers and employers in search of hiring opportunities. Because of the high demand for recruitment, it is insufficient to use conventional hiring methods to find a suitable candidate to fill the position. Validating resumes online is challenging due to the potential for manual errors, making the process inherently risky. The bidirectional method comprises named entity recognition (NER) for extracting the required resumes for recruiters. Cosine similarity shows the match percentage of resumes for the job requirements and vice versa. In an attempt to tackle an issue of unregistered words, a solution called decoder attention with pointer network (DA-PN) has been introduced. This method incorporates the use of coverage mechanism to prevent word repetition through generated text summary. DA-PN+Cover method with mixed learning objective (MLO) (DA-PN+Cover+MLO) is utilized for protecting grow of increasing faults in generated text summary.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper deals with automated football match reports as a common genre of automated journalism. Based on a corpus of automated and human-written reports (nÂ =Â 1,302) on the same set of matches and with reference to linguistic concepts of text and textuality, the textual properties of these texts are analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The analysis is based on the idea that the task of text generation can be described as the task of automatically selecting cues of textuality such as connectives or signals of thematic relatedness. The results show that automated and human-written texts differ significantly in the use of these cues, particularly in the use of linguistic means for creating evaluation and contrast, and thus allow to trace in detail, how these cues contribute to cohesion, coherence and narrative qualities. Different from computational linguistic approaches focused on optimizing text generation algorithms, this paper proposes to use automated texts, which are to some extent imperfect, as models of textuality that through their imperfection can say something about the nature of texts in general. The paper thus contributes to the field of (mostly communication studies) research on automated journalism in which the texts themselves are rarely investigated.",

        "abstract": "High morphological languages are characterized by complex inflections and derivations, which can present challenges for natural language processing tasks such as summarization. Abstractive text summarization aims to generate a summary by understanding the meaning of the text, rather than solely relying on the words used in the original source. However, few works address theÂ  generation of abstractive summaries due to its complexity. One of the challenges is the absence of a reliable metric to evaluate the performance of abstractive summaries. This paper proposes a lemma-based ROUGE metric and investigates the effectiveness of normalization forms in the similarity matching of the ROUGE metric for evaluating abstractive text summarization systems. We use Arabic as a case study and compare results involving different forms of the word: as is, stem-based, and lemma-based. The results show that the lemma-based form achieves higher ROUGE scores than the other forms. The findings emphasize the impact of morphological complexity on the performance of abstractive text summarization systems.",

        "abstract": "In today's world, where data and information are increasingly proliferating, text summarization and technologies play a critical role in making large amounts of text data more accessible and meaningful. In business, the news industry, academic research, and many other fields, text summarization helps make quick decisions, access information faster, and manage resources more effectively. Additionally, text summarization research is conducted to further improve these technologies and develop new methods and algorithms to provide better summarization of texts. Therefore, text summarization and research in this field are of great importance in the information age. In this study, a new operating model for text summarization that can be applied to different algorithms is proposed and evaluated. Sixteen summarization algorithms covering six approaches (statistical, graph-based, content-based, pointer-based, position-based, and user-oriented) were implemented and tested on 50 different full-text article datasets. Four evaluation criteria (BLEU, Rouge-N, Rouge-L, METEOR) were used to assess the similarity between the generated summaries and the original summaries. The performance of the algorithms within each approach was averaged and the overall best-performing algorithm was selected. This best algorithm was subjected to further analysis through Topic Modelling and Keyword Extraction to identify key topics and keywords within the summarised text. The proposed model provides a standardized workflow for developing and thoroughly testing summarization algorithms across datasets and evaluation metrics to determine the most appropriate summarization approach. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the model on a variety of algorithm types and text sources.",

        "abstract": "In contemporary times, an abundance of unstructured data prevails across social media and the web. Text summarization, a process aimed at distilling relevant information concisely without altering its core meaning, has become crucial. Manual text summarization is resource-intensive, prompting the exploration of automated methods. While deep learning algorithms, particularly in abstractive text summarization, have gained popularity, further research is needed to understand their integration with semantic-based or structure-based approaches.\nThis research leverages a dataset of 1,735 resumes sourced from Kaggle to propose a novel framework. The framework combines semantic data transformations and deep learning approaches to enhance abstractive text summarization. A key focus is addressing the challenge of handling unregistered words. The proposed solution, Decoder Attention with Pointer Network (DA-PN), is introduced. DA-PN incorporates a coverage mechanism to mitigate word repetition in generated text summaries, thereby improving the quality of summaries. The method aims to safeguard against the propagation of errors in generated text summaries. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) indicator. Notably, the proposed method achieves an average ROUGE score of 26.28, surpassing existing methods. The emphasis on combining semantic data transformations, deep learning, and addressing specific challenges like word repetition sets this research apart in the field of abstractive text summarization.",

        "abstract": "Transformer-based models such as GPT, T5, BART, and PEGASUS have made substantial progress in text summarization, a sub-domain of natural language processing that entails extracting important information from lengthy texts. The main objective of this research was to conduct a comparative analysis of these four transformer-based models based on their performance in text summarization of news articles. In achieving this objective, the transformer models pre-trained on extensive datasets were fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail dataset using a low learning rate to preserve the learned representations. The T5 transformer records the highest scores of 35.12, 22.75, 32.82, and 28.59 in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-Lsum respectively, surpassing GPT, BART, and PEGASUS across all ROUGE metrics. The findings deduced from this study establish the proficiency of encoder-decoder models such as T5 in summary generation. Furthermore, the findings also demonstrated that the fine-tuning process's effectiveness in pre-trained models is improved when the pre-training objective closely aligns with the downstream task.",
