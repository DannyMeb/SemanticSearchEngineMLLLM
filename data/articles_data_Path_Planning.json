        "abstract": "This manuscript proposes a novel tangent-graph-based method that provides all distinctive topology paths, as a set of trajectories that can not be transformed into each other by gradual bending and stretching without colliding with obstacles. As the global optimal trajectory (limited by dynamic constraints) may not correspond to the shortest path (almost without dynamic constraints), it is important to provide all distinctive topology paths rather than just the globally shortest one. One of the application is provide initial paths for trajectory planning methods, such as time elastic band (TEB) and dynamic window approach (DWA). Considering that a mobile platform is always working in a dynamic changing environment and that update the whole graph is time consuming, a dynamic rectify method is proposed to update tangents according to local map provided by sensor reading. Finally, results under real grid maps are presented.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles have been at the forefront of academic and industrial research in recent decades. This study’s aim is to reduce traffic congestion, improve safety, and accidents. Path planning algorithms are one of the main elements in autonomous vehicles that make critical decisions. Motion planning methods are required when transporting passengers from one point to another. These methods have incorporated several methods such as generating the best trajectory while considering the constraints of vehicle dynamics and obstacles, searching a path to follow, and avoiding obstacles that guarantee comfort, safety, and efficiency. We suggested an effective path planning algorithm based on Model Predictive Controller that determines the maneuvers mode such as lane-keeping and lane-changing automatically. We utilized two different artificial potential field functions for the road boundary, obstacles, and lane center to ensure safety. On the four scenarios, we examined the proposed path planning controller. The obtained results show that when a path planning controller is used, the vehicle avoids colliding with obstacles and follows the rules of the road by adjusting the vehicle’s dynamics. An autonomous vehicle’s safety is ensured by the path planning controller.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in performing diverse missions at significantly lower costs compared to the human beings. UAVs have the capabilities to reach and execute mission in those areas that are very difficult for humans to even reach such as forest, deserts, and mines. Integration of the latest technologies including reactive controls, sense and avoid, and onboard computations have strengthened their dominance further in various practical missions. Besides the innovative applications, the use of UAVs imposes several challenges, and one of those challenges is computing a low-cost path for aerial mission by avoiding obstacles as well as satisfying certain performance objectives (a.k.a path planning (PP)). To this end, this chapter provides a concise overview of various aspects concerning to PP including basics introduction of the subject matter, categorization of the PP approaches and problems, taxonomy of the essential components of the PP, performance objectives of the PP approaches, recent algorithms that have been proposed for PP in known and unknown environments, and future prospects of research in this area considering the emerging technologies. With this chapter, we aim to provide sufficient knowledge about one of the essential components of robotics technology (i.e., navigation) for researchers.",

First, it assesses ability of the popularly growing bibliometric method in tracking the real contribution of publications. Then it summarizes developments in the land use planning literature in three themes - general literature path building, land use planning context, and development of methods. It is observed that bibliometric method rewards information carriage paper more than the original contributors. Key planning context gaps include detachment of the general goal-oriented objective formulations from the basic land use allocation theories and models and certain urban land use optimization objectives even contradict the original though of sustainable city. Key research frontiers include: linking basic land use allocation and utility theories in urban land use planning; shifting the current urban land use planning from spatial optimization to activities into optimizing flow resources to available spatial configurations; evaluating existing built environment for optimality; transferring knowledge from rural land-use planning to urban land use planning. In method development, the key frontier would be advancing the current loosely coupled methods into more integrated systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNavigation of mobile robots in unknown environments continues to be a common and challenging problem in robotics. In order to improve the mobile robot to obtain the global optimal path and real-time obstacle avoidance capability, this paper proposes a new fusion algorithm based on A* algorithm and DWA (Dynamic Window Approach) algorithm. First, compared with the classical Dijkstra algorithm and BFS(Best First Search) algorithm, the A* algorithm is optimized in path search. Although adding heuristic functions to the A* algorithm can reduce a large number of useless search nodes, experiments show that there are still many useless search nodes, and the obtained global path is not a feasible path in some cases or will increase the movement time significantly, and unsafe paths. In this paper, we add the ideal path area constraint to the A* algorithm, and then integrate the DWA algorithm to address the problem that the A* algorithm is not suitable for real-time obstacle avoidance in dynamic obstacle environments. Simulation results show that the improved A* algorithm can significantly reduce the number of nodes to be searched and decrease the running time of the DWA algorithm compared with the traditional Dijkstra, BFS, and A* algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Path planning in 3D environment is a fundamental research area for robots and autonomous vehicles. Based on the principle ``the shortest path consists of tangents'', RimJump* is proposed as a tangent-based path planning method suitable for finding the shortest path (both off-ground and on-ground) in 3D space (e.g., octomap and point cloud) for mobile platform to follow. RimJump* searches the tangent graph in the form of a path tree and considers the geometrical properties of the locally shortest path. Therefore, the method can provide all of the locally shortest paths that connect the starting point and the target, including the globally shortest path. And the time cost of RimJump* is insensitive to map scale increases in comparison to methods that search the whole passable space rather than the surface of the obstacle, e.g., Dijkstra and A*. In the Results, RimJump* is compared with other methods in terms of path length and time cost.",

Past work has solved some aspects of this problem, but not all. This research presents the first complete, practical solution to the problem. It works by creating a fixed RRT in advance, and then during operation connecting pushing poses into this RRT using Bezier curves. The RRT algorithm leverages a novel data structure for performing nearest neighbour comparisons for Ackermann-steering vehicles; termed the Distmetree. The resulting pushing states are searched using greedy heuristic search to find a solution and the final path is smoothed with cubic Bezier curves. The mode of operation chosen for best performance also constructs bidirectional RRTs to reach difficult to access pushing poses. The final mode of the algorithm was tested in simulation and proven to be able to solve a wide variety of maps in a few minutes while obeying bulldozer kinematic constraints. The algorithm, whilst not optimal, is complete which is the more desirable property in industry, and the solutions it produces are both feasible and reasonable.",
