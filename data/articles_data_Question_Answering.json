        "abstract": "AbstractThe effectiveness of natural language processing models relies on various factors, including the architecture, number of parameters, data used during training, and the tasks they were trained on. Recent studies indicate that models pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned on task-specific datasets, covering multiple tasks, can generate remarkable results across various benchmarks. We propose a new approach based on a straightforward hypothesis: improving model performance on a target task by considering other artificial tasks defined on the same training dataset. By doing so, the model can gain further insights into the training dataset and attain a greater understanding, improving efficiency on the target task. This approach differs from others that consider multiple pre-existing tasks on different datasets. We validate this hypothesis by focusing on the problem of answering yes/no questions and introducing a multi-task model that outputs a span of the reference text, serving as evidence for answering the question. The task of span extraction is an artificial one, designed to benefit the performance of the model answering yes/no questions. We acquire weak supervision for these spans, by using a pre-trained extractive question answering model, dispensing the need for costly human annotation. Our experiments, using modern transformer-based language models, demonstrate that this method outperforms the standard approach of training models to answer yes/no questions. Although the primary objective was to enhance the performance of the model in answering yes/no questions, it was discovered that span texts are a significant source of information. These spans, derived from the question reference texts, provided valuable insights for the users to better comprehend the answers to the questions. The model’s improved accuracy in answering yes/no questions, coupled with the supplementary information provided by the span texts, led to a more comprehensive and informative user experience.",

It discusses how the mysterious plane scene seems to have bothered viewers a great deal and kept coming up in interviews with Gilliam. It also mentions a scene in 12 Monkeys that seems to offer a final comment on the free will versus determinism dilemma. The chapter analyses how humanity's survival must be purchased with the coin of human misery stretching far into the post-apocalyptic future, which is a concept that is made to be accepted in 12 Monkeys. It mentions Drew Goddard's The Cabin in the Woods from 2012, in which two dying teenagers respond whether it is acceptable to have a world in which humans are capable of the deliberate slaughter of others.",

However, inquirers may not obtain useful answers and those who are qualified to provide answers may also miss opportunities to share their expertise without any notice. To address this problem, the purpose of this paper is to provide the means for inquirers to access archived answers and to identify effective subject matter experts for target questions.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper presents a question answering promoter, called QAP, for the CQA services. The proposed QAP facilitates the use of filtered archived answers regarded as explicit knowledge and recommended experts regarded as sources of implicit knowledge for the given target questions.\n\n\nFindings\nThe experimental results indicate that QAP can leverage knowledge sharing by refining archived answers upon creditability and distributing raised questions to qualified potential experts.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis proposed method is designed for the traditional Chinese corpus.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper proposed an integrated framework of answer selection and expert finding uses the bottom-up multipath evaluation algorithm, an underlying voting model, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique and feature approaches of answer trustworthiness measuring, identification of satisfied learners and credibility of repliers. The experiments using the corpus crawled from Yahoo! Knowledge Plus under designed scenarios are conducted and results are shown in fine details.\n",

Managing this information stream manually is not feasible. Automatic Question Answering can quickly bring the most salient points to the user’s attention. Leveraging a collection of scientific articles, government websites, relevant news articles, curated social media posts, and questions asked by researchers, clinicians, and the general public, we developed a dataset to explore automatic Question Answering for multiple stakeholders. Analysis of questions asked by various stakeholders shows that while information needs of experts and the public may overlap, satisfactory answers to these questions often originate from different information sources or benefit from different approaches to answer generation. We believe that this dataset has the potential to support the development of question answering systems not only for epidemic questions, but for other domains with varying expertise such as legal or finance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nVideo Question Answering (VideoQA) is a task that involves answering questions related to videos. The main idea is to understand the content of the video and combine it with the relevant semantic context to answer different types of questions. Existing methods typically analyze the spatio-temporal correlations of the entire video to answer questions. However, for some simple questions, the answer is only related to a specific frame of the video, and analyzing the entire video undoubtedly increases the learning cost. For some complex questions, the information contained in the video is limited, and these methods are not sufficient to fully answer such questions. Therefore, this paper proposes a VideoQA model based on question classification and a traffic knowledge base.The model starts from the perspective of the question and classifies the questions into general scene questions and causal questions, using different methods to process these two types of questions. For general scene questions, we first extract the key frames of the video to convert it into a simpler image question-answering task, and then use top-down and bottom-up attention mechanisms to process it. For causal questions, we design a lightweight traffic knowledge base that provides relevant traffic knowledge not originally present in VideoQA datasets, to help the model reason. We then use a question and knowledge-guided aggregation graph attention network to process causal questions.Experiments show that our model performs better on the TrafficQA dataset than models using millions of external data for pre-training, while greatly reducing resource costs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundOne of the challenges in large-scale information retrieval (IR) is developing fine-grained and domain-specific methods to answer natural language questions. Despite the availability of numerous sources and datasets for answer retrieval, Question Answering (QA) remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of the question understanding and answer extraction tasks. One of the promising tracks investigated in QA is mapping new questions to formerly answered questions that are “similar”.ResultsWe propose a novel QA approach based on Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) and we describe the QA system and resources that we built and evaluated on real medical questions. First, we compare logistic regression and deep learning methods for RQE using different kinds of datasets including textual inference, question similarity, and entailment in both the open and clinical domains. Second, we combine IR models with the best RQE method to select entailed questions and rank the retrieved answers. To study the end-to-end QA approach, we built the MedQuAD collection of 47,457 question-answer pairs from trusted medical sources which we introduce and share in the scope of this paper. Following the evaluation process used in TREC 2017 LiveQA, we find that our approach exceeds the best results of the medical task with a 29.8% increase over the best official score.ConclusionsThe evaluation results support the relevance of question entailment for QA and highlight the effectiveness of combining IR and RQE for future QA efforts. Our findings also show that relying on a restricted set of reliable answer sources can bring a substantial improvement in medical QA.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recently years, some visual question answering (VQA) methods that emphasize the simultaneous understanding of both the context of image and question have been proposed. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they fail to explore a more comprehensive and generalized context learning tactics. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multiple Context Learning Networks (MCLN) to model the multiple contexts for VQA. Three kinds of contexts are investigated, namely visual context, textual context and a special visual-textual context that ignored by previous methods. Moreover, three corresponding context learning modules are proposed. These modules endow image and text representations with context-aware information based on a uniform context learning strategy. And they work together to form a multiple context learning layer (MCL). Such MCL can be stacked in depth and which describe high-level context information by associating intra-modal contexts with inter-modal context. On the VQA v2.0 datasets, the proposed model achieves 71.05% and 71.48% on test-dev set and test-std set respectively, and gains better performance than the previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, extensive ablation studies have been carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "There are many task in surveillance monitoring such as object detection, person identification, activity and action recognition etc. Integrating variety of surveillance task through a multimodal interactive system will benefit real-life deployment, and will also support human operators. We first introduce a dataset which is first of its kind and named as Surveillance Video Question Answering (SVideoQA) dataset. The multi-camera surveillance monitoring aspect is considered through the multimodal context of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the SVideoQA dataset. This paper proposes a deep learning model where VideoQA task on the SVideoQA dataset is attempted to solved in a manner where memory-driven relationship among appearance and motion aspect of the video features are captured. At each level of the relational reasoning respective attentive parts of the context of the motion and appearance features are identified forwarded through frame level and clip level relational reasoning module. Also, respective memories are updated which are again forwarded to the memory-relation module to finally predict the answer word. The proposed memory-driven multilevel relational reasoning is made compatible with the surveillance monitoring task through the incorporation of multi-camera relation module, which is able to capture and reason over the relationships among the video feeds across multiple cameras. Experimental outcome exhibits that the proposed memory-driven multilevel relational reasoning perform significantly better on the open-ended VideoQA task compared to other state-of-the art systems. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 57\\% and 57.6\\% respectively for the single-camera and multi-camera task of the SVideoQA dataset.",
