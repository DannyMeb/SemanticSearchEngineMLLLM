        "abstract": "With the accelerated evolution of social networks, there is a tremendous increase in opinions by the people about products or services. While this user-generated content in natural language is intended to be valuable, its large amounts require use of content mining methods and NLP to uncover the knowledge for various tasks. In this study, sentiment analysis is used to analyze and understand the opinions of users using statistical approaches, knowledge-based approaches, hybrid approaches, and concept-based ontologies. Unfortunately, sentiment analysis also experiences a range of difficulties like colloquial words, negation handling, ambiguity in word sense, coreference resolution, which highlight another perspective emphasizing that sentiment analysis is certainly a restricted NLP problem. The purpose of this chapter is to discover how sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem. Thus, this chapter discussed the concept of sentiment analysis in the field of NLP and explored that sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem due to the sophisticated nature of natural language.

In the first experiment the vector representation of each sentence is generated by using Skip-gram model followed by the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classification and it is observed that the F1 score of 0.6486 is achieved for positive-negative classification with overall accuracy of 68%. Whereas in the second experiment the verb chunks are extracted using Nepali parser and carried out the similar experiment on the verb chunks. F1 score of 0.6779 is observedfor positive -negative classification with overall accuracy of 85%. Hence, Chunker based sentiment analysis is proven to be better than sentiment analysis using sentences.",

        "abstract": "Multilingual Sentiment analysis plays an important role in a country like India with many languages as the style of expression varies in different languages. The Indian people speak in total 22 different languages and with the help of Google Indic keyboard people can express their sentiments i.e reviews about anything in the social media in their native language from individual smart phones. It has been found that machine learning approach has overcome the limitations of other approaches. In this paper, a detailed study has been carried out based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Simple Neural Network (SNN) ,Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network followed by another amalgamated model adding a CNN layer on top of the LSTM without worrying about versatility of multilingualism. Around 4000 samples of reviews in English, Hindi and in Bengali languages are considered to generate outputs for the above models and analyzed. The experimental results on these realistic reviews are found to be effective for further research work.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the sentiments of Twitter users towards the emergent topic of ChatGPT, leveraging advanced techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis (SA). Our approach uniquely incorporates a dual setting for sentiment analysis: one analyzes the sentiments of original, full-length tweets, while the other first condenses these tweets into succinct summaries before performing sentiment analysis. By employing this dual approach, we are able to offer a comparative analysis of sentiment assessment pre- and post-text summarization, exploring the accuracy and reliability of the summarized sentiments. Central to our methodology is the application of Transformer models, specifically ProphetNet, which facilitates a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the original text. Unlike traditional methods that rely on keyword extraction and aggregation, our approach generates coherent and contextually rich summaries, providing a novel lens for sentiment analysis. This research contributes to the field by presenting a comprehensive study comparing sentiment analysis outcomes between original texts and their summarized counterparts, and examining the effectiveness of different NLP techniques, namely NLTK and the Transformer-based ProphetNet model. The findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of sentiment analysis in the context of social media and the efficacy of state-of-the-art NLP technologies in processing complex, real-world data.",

        "abstract": "Transparency in financial reporting is crucial for maintaining trust in financial markets, yet fraudulent financial statements remain challenging to detect and prevent. This study introduces a novel approach to detecting financial statement fraud by applying sentiment analysis to analyse the textual data within financial reports. This research aims to identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activities by examining the language and sentiment expressed across multiple fiscal years. The study focuses on three companies known for financial statement fraud: Wirecard, Tesco, and Under Armour. Utilising Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the research analyses polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (degree of personal opinion) within the financial statements, revealing intriguing patterns. Wirecard showed a consistent tone with a slight decrease in 2018, Tesco exhibited marked changes in the fraud year, and Under Armour presented subtler shifts during the fraud years. While the findings present promising trends, the study emphasises that sentiment analysis alone cannot definitively detect financial statement fraud. It provides insights into the tone and mood of the text but cannot reveal intentional deception or financial discrepancies. The results serve as supplementary information, enriching traditional financial analysis methods. This research contributes to the field by exploring the potential of sentiment analysis in financial fraud detection, offering a unique perspective that complements quantitative methods. It opens new avenues for investigation and underscores the need for an integrated, multidimensional approach to fraud detection.",

But we can’t test or check the quality of products in online shopping. In those circumstances, product reviews play a vital role in purchasers purchasing a product. Sentiment analysis of the product makes the customer identify the best quality product effortlessly and gives perfect decision-making for the product choice. However, people across countries who speak different languages might find it arduous to analyze the situation. We proposed a solution in which we can do both language identification, translation, and analysis of the text review data. Using a Google Language translator, we can identify and translate the language to any destination language that we want to analyze the text. VADER makes that analysis and gives us the best result for the product reviews. The experimental results of the proposed solutions were well-defined and established in sentiment analysis tasks.",

        "abstract": "One of the most prominent parts of opinion mining is sentiment analysis that is used to extract emotion from textual features. Through this process, it can be determined whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. This paper presents a review on the sentiment analysis task using textual data. A sentiment analysis system for text com-bines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning Techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes, and categories within a sentence or phrase. One of the prominent parts of opinion mining is depression detection. Nowadays, a significant section of society is affected by depression due to mental stress. So, it is also a considerable concern. There may be several reasons for depression, especially in adults. Different people have different symptoms, and its identification is a significant challenge. Most people feel shy to accept that they suffer from depression, while some people are unaware of their depressed mental health. The objective of this paper is to analyze recently developed frameworks for the diagnosis of sentiment and depression level of an individual. This paper directs towards creating a single framework in the future for depression and sentiment analysis.",

        "abstract": "With the accelerated evolution of social networks, there is a tremendous increase in opinions by the people about products or services. While this user-generated content in natural language is intended to be valuable, its large amounts require use of content mining methods and NLP to uncover the knowledge for various tasks. In this study, sentiment analysis is used to analyze and understand the opinions of users using statistical approaches, knowledge-based approaches, hybrid approaches, and concept-based ontologies. Unfortunately, sentiment analysis also experiences a range of difficulties like colloquial words, negation handling, ambiguity in word sense, coreference resolution, which highlight another perspective emphasizing that sentiment analysis is certainly a restricted NLP problem. The purpose of this chapter is to discover how sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem. Thus, this chapter discussed the concept of sentiment analysis in the field of NLP and explored that sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem due to the sophisticated nature of natural language.

The prediction of these characteristics is performed by application of unsupervised learning algorithms on meta-data, communication statistics, and the results of deep linguistic analysis of the message body.

The Indian people speak in total 22 different languages and with the help of Google Indic keyboard people can express their sentiments i.e reviews about anything in the social media in their native language from individual smart phones. It has been found that machine learning approach has overcome the limitations of other approaches. In this paper, a detailed study has been carried out based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Simple Neural Network (SNN) ,Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)Neural Network followed by another amalgamated model adding a CNN layer on top of the LSTM without worrying about versatility of multilingualism. Around 4000 samples of reviews in English, Hindi and in Bengali languages are considered to generate outputs for the above models and analyzed. The experimental results on these realistic reviews are found to be effective for further research work.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to prove the use of content and sentiment analysis to understand public discourse on Nytimes.com around the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) pandemic. We examined the pandemic discourses in the article contents, news, expert opinions, and statements of official institutions with natural language processing methods. We analyzed how the mainstream media (Nytimes.com) sets the community agenda. As a method, the textual data for the research were collected with the Orange3 software text-mining tool via the Nytimes.com API, and content analysis was conducted with Leximancer software. The research data were divided into three categories (first, mid, and last) based on the date ranges determined during the pandemic. Using Leximancer concept maps tools, we explained concepts and their relationships by visualizing them to show pandemic discourse. We used VADER sentiment analysis to analyze the pandemic discourse. The results gave us the distance and proximity positions of themes related to Nytimes.com pandemic discourse, revealed according to their conceptual definitions. Additionally, we compared the performance of six machine learning algorithms on the task of text classification. Considering the findings, it is possible to conclude that in Nytimes.com (2019-nCOV) discourse, some concepts have changed on a regular basis while others have remained constant. The pandemic discourse focused on specific concepts that were seen to guide human behavior and presented content that may cause anxiety to readers of Nytimes.com. The results of the sentiment analysis supported these findings. Another result was that the findings showed us that the contents of the coronavirus (2019-nCOV) articles supported official policies. It can be concluded that regarding the coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which has caused profound societal changes and has results such as death, restrictions, and mask use, the discourse did not go beyond a total of 15 main themes and about 100 concepts. The content analysis of Nytimes.com reveals that it has behavioral effects, such as causing fear and anxiety in people. Considering the media dependency of society, this result is important. It can be said that the agenda-setting of society does not go beyond the traditional discourse due to the tendency of individuals to use newspapers and news websites to obtain information.",

        "abstract": "In this study, sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining or emotional artificial intelligence (AI), is used to obtain student comments about institutional facilities. To ascertain whether an online text has a good, negative, or neutral emotional tone, it must first be analyzed. Natural Language Processing (NLP) includes the subfield of sentiment analysis, and NLP can be used to categorize and extract information with the aid of machine learning methods. Finding out if students are content with the amenities or services provided is important since, in an educational setting, they are consumers. This study of the resources and services that the libraries offer evaluated college students' perceptions of the books, audio CDs, and video CDs, the services provided by the library staff, and the personal computers that are made available to them as part of their facilities. In the current study, surveys were carried out to gather information and assess how well the needs of the students are addressed. On Kaggle.com, secondary data from a North Indian institution was used in the experiments. The research approach was sentiment analysis using a machine learning framework. The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall based on the attitudes evaluated by the algorithms, was calculated using a text-based classification method using Naive Bayes Multinomial and Support Vector machine learning algorithms. The findings offer views on how successfully library facilities are managed in the form of student sentiments.",

The research involves data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, sentiment analysis, model construction, and visualization. The data is then processed to address issues like extraneous characters, capitalization, and data errors. Sentiment analysis categorizes tweets into positive and negative. The NLP algorithm is central to sentiment classification, and the paper builds, trains, and assesses various machine learning models. Word clouds depict sentiment distribution, identify frequently occurring phrases, and emphasize sentiment trends over time. Potential roadblocks include data quality issues, careful algorithm selection, and model dependability. The sentiment analysis model demonstrated good accuracy and a balanced F1-score, demonstrating its competency in sentiment categorization. The study contributes to the emerging discipline of sentiment analysis by demonstrating how valuable insights can be extracted from massive amounts of social media data.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, sentiment analysis has been widely applied in many domains, including business, social networks and education. Particularly in the education domain, where dealing with and processing students’ opinions is a complicated task due to the nature of the language used by students and the large volume of information, the application of sentiment analysis is growing yet remains challenging. Several literature reviews reveal the state of the application of sentiment analysis in this domain from different perspectives and contexts. However, the body of literature is lacking a review that systematically classifies the research and results of the application of natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) solutions for sentiment analysis in the education domain. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping study to structure the published information available. We used a stepwise PRISMA framework to guide the search process and searched for studies conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the electronic research databases of the scientific literature. We identified 92 relevant studies out of 612 that were initially found on the sentiment analysis of students’ feedback in learning platform environments. The mapping results showed that, despite the identified challenges, the field is rapidly growing, especially regarding the application of DL, which is the most recent trend. We identified various aspects that need to be considered in order to contribute to the maturity of research and development in the field. Among these aspects, we highlighted the need of having structured datasets, standardized solutions and increased focus on emotional expression and detection.",

        "abstract": "The global impact of COVID-19 has been significant and several vaccines have been developed to combat this virus. However, these vaccines have varying levels of efficacy and effectiveness in preventing illness and providing immunity. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, the development and distribution of effective vaccines remains a top priority, making monitoring prevention strategies mandatory and necessary to mitigate the spread of the disease. These vaccines have raised a huge debate on social networks and in the media about their effectiveness and secondary effects. This has generated big data, requiring intelligent tools capable of analyzing these data in depth and extracting the underlying knowledge and feelings. There is a scarcity of works that analyze feelings and the prediction of these feelings based on their estimated polarities at the same time. In this work, first, we use big data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to extract the entities expressed in tweets about AstraZeneca and Pfizer and estimate their polarities; second, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the polarities of these two vaccines in the future. To ensure parallel data treatment for large-scale processing via clustered systems, we use the Apache Spark Framework (ASF) which enables the treatment of massive amounts of data in a distributed way. Results showed that the Pfizer vaccine is more popular and trustworthy than AstraZeneca. Additionally, according to the predictions generated by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, it is likely that Pfizer will continue to maintain its strong market position in the foreseeable future. These predictive analytics, which uses advanced machine learning techniques, have proven to be accurate in forecasting trends and identifying patterns in data. As such, we have confidence in the LSTM's prediction of Pfizer's ongoing dominance in the industry.",

This study proposed a text mining approach to measure consumer sentiments at the feature level and their asymmetric impacts on overall product ratings.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed 49,130 OCRs generated for 14 wireless earbud products on Amazon.com. Word combinations of the major quality dimensions and related sentiment words were identified using bigram natural language processing (NLP) analysis. This study combined sentiment dictionaries and feature-related bigrams and measured feature level sentiment scores in a review. Furthermore, the authors examined the effect of feature level sentiment on product ratings.FindingsThe results indicate that customer sentiment for product features measured from text reviews significantly and asymmetrically affects the overall rating. Building upon the three-factor theory of customer satisfaction, the key quality dimensions of wireless earbuds are categorized into basic, excitement and performance factors.Originality/valueThis study provides a novel approach to assess customer feature level evaluation of a product and its impact on customer satisfaction based on big data analytics. By applying the suggested methodology, marketing managers can gain in-depth insights into consumer needs and reflect this knowledge in their future product or service improvement.",
