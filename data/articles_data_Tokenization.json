        "abstract": "Tokenization is an important preprocessing step in natural language processing that may have a significant influence on prediction quality. In this study we show that the conventional SMILES tokenization itself is at fault, resulting in tokens that fail to reflect the true nature of molecules. To address this we propose atom-in-SMILES approach, resolving the ambiguities in the genericness of SMILES tokens. Our findings in multiple translation tasks suggest that proper tokenization has a great impact on the prediction quality. Considering the prediction accuracy and token degeneration comparisons, atom-in-SMILES appears as an effective method to draw higher quality SMILES sequences out of AI-based chemical models than other tokenization schemes. We investigate the token degeneration, highlight its pernicious influence on prediction quality, quantify the token-level repetitions, and include generated examples for qualitative analysis. We believe that atom-in-SMILES tokenization can readily be utilized by the community at large, providing chemically accurate, tailor-made tokens for molecular prediction models.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep learning models are transforming biological research. Many bioinformatics and comparative genomics algorithms analyze genomic data, either DNA or protein sequences. Examples include sequence alignments, phylogenetic tree inference and automatic classification of protein functions. Among these deep learning algorithms, models for processing natural languages, developed in the natural language processing (NLP) community, were recently applied to biological sequences. However, biological sequences are different than natural languages, such as English, and French, in which segmentation of the text to separate words is relatively straightforward. Moreover, biological sequences are characterized by extremely long sentences, which hamper their processing by current machine-learning models, notably the transformer architecture. In NLP, one of the first processing steps is to transform the raw text to a list of tokens. Deep-learning applications to biological sequence data mostly segment proteins and DNA to single characters. In this work, we study the effect of alternative tokenization algorithms on eight different tasks in biology, from predicting the function of proteins and their stability, through nucleotide sequence alignment, to classifying proteins to specific families. We demonstrate that applying alternative tokenization algorithms can increase accuracy and at the same time, substantially reduce the input length compared to the trivial tokenizer in which each character is a token. Furthermore, applying these tokenization algorithms allows interpreting trained models, taking into account dependencies among positions. Finally, we trained these tokenizers on a large dataset of protein sequences containing more than 400 billion amino acids, which resulted in over a three-fold decrease in the number of tokens. We then tested these tokenizers trained on large-scale data on the above specific tasks and showed that for some tasks it is highly beneficial to train database-specific tokenizers. Our study suggests that tokenizers are likely to be a critical component in future deep-network analysis of biological sequence data.",

        "abstract": "Financial innovation has given great importance to sustainability. The Sustainable Finance Strategy represents one of the central points of the European agenda, and Fintech offers important opportunities in this field. However, some “valuable” Fintech instruments seem to not have been adequately considered. The reference is to Bitcoin and to the “crypto-industry”. The most common public belief about Bitcoin and sustainability is that Bitcoin is polluting the ecosystem. Immediately, the concept is extended to Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), to blockchain and to all related innovations. Notwithstanding this, some research shows that there is still some uncertainty on the precise amount of energy used by Bitcoin-related activities and on how to calculate it. The scope of this paper is to make give some clarity on this uncertainly in order to show, on the one hand that DLT is not “polluting”, but that pollutions come from the way each miner decides to conduct their businesses. On the other hand, a DLT system can be considered sustainable thanks to its capacity to solve a various number of environmental problems “related” to how businesses are conducted.",

Centralization whether in the form of governments, financial institutions, enterprises and organizations is simply being challenged because of the lack of trust associated with data governance often experienced in the form of data breaches or simply a monetization of our data without our permission and/or incentives to participate in this emerging decentralization of structures. We see this trust deficit challenging the very institutions we have depended on including but not limited to financial institutions, private enterprises or government bodies. A new “social contract” is required as we continuously evolve into more decentralized and self-governing (or semi self-governing) entities. We will see more development in digital sovereignty with the caveat that a governance model will need to be defined. This position paper will present evidence that supports the premise that blockchain and individual tokenization could provide a new social contract.",

Inthis paper, we propose a smart contract-based system for the tokenization of rental estate assets usingthe Solidity programming language along with the framework. The system aims to provide a secureand transparent way to buy and sell a fraction of ownership of rental estate assets by leveraging thedecentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology. Our study showcases the outcomes ofthe regression analysis conducted on synthetic historical data of rental estate returns and risk factors.The findings revealed a significant positive correlation between rental estate returns or rental yieldand risk-return factors. Additionally, we describe the Analysis of Variance(ANOVA) analysis, whichconfirms the statistical significance of our proposed model. Our findings suggest that tokenizationof rental estate assets using blockchain technology can bring substantial benefits to estate investors,such as increased liquidity and reduced transaction costs. This study contributes to the developmentof the estate industry by proposing a novel model of blockchain technology in the context of rentalestate asset tokenization.",

        "abstract": "Objective: tokenization of creativity, alongside with cryptoeconomy and Web3 network infrastructure, is a notable trend in the development of modern society in the third decade of the 21st century. The objective of this article is to explore the risks and prospects emerging in the process of disposition of the creative labor results in the form of non-fungible tokens.Methods: the research methodology is based on analysis of varied viewpoints on the problem, including diametrically opposing concepts. The opposing views of the observers manifest their attitude to tokenization of creative products as a speculative scheme, on the one hand, and a promising tool of creative industries development, on the other.Results: the probable negative consequences of tokenization of intellectual activity results are identified; author’s recommendations on managing these risks are given. Another result of this publication is analysis of economiclegal prospects stemming from tokenization of the objects of copyright and neighboring rights by the example of musical pieces.Scientific novelty: it consists in presenting and substantiating a hypothesis that the relations formed in the musical industry under the modern sociocultural and technological realities will be reproduced in other creative industries. Also, scientific novelty consists in the analysis of prospects of tokenization of such results of intellectual activity as gaming artifacts, works of traditional and digital visual arts, patents and scientific achievements. The use of nonfungible tokens the ecosystem of network computer games will allow gamers to buy and sell rights to game pieces autonomously from game publishers. Tokenization of industrial property objects and individualization means will ensure protection of intellectual rights of their authors while waiting for the issuance of a state protection document. In the modern society, there will be many of those wishing to become an owner of a token for a scientific work, as the popularity of science and innovations is constantly growing in developed countries. Ownership of a token for a scientific work will be regarded a moral investment, increasing the prestige and status of its owner. Tokens for scientific works have a high potential as a means of measuring value in a post-economic society.Practical significance: it consists in the description of innovative means of using creative products and business models based on tokenization of the results of intellectual activity, ready to be implemented in practice.",

In the early stage of grammar development, a language-independent tokenizer was used to split the input stream into a unique sequence of tokens. is simple transducer took into account general character classes, without using any language-specific information. However, at a later stage of grammar development, uncovered and non-trivial tokenization issues arose, including issues related to multi-word expressions (MWEs), clitics and text normalization. As a consequence, the tokenizer was extended by integrating FST components. is extension was crucial for scaling the hand-written grammar to free text and for enhancing the performance of the parser. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractDomain name generation algorithm (DGA) classification is an essential but challenging problem. Both feature-extracting machine learning (ML) methods and deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory have been developed. However, the performance of these approaches varies with different types of DGAs. Most features in the ML methods can characterize random-looking DGAs better than word-looking DGAs. To improve the classification performance on word-looking DGAs, subword tokenization is employed for the DL models. Our experimental results proved that the subword tokenization can provide excellent classification performance on the word-looking DGAs. We then propose an integrated scheme that chooses an appropriate method for DGA classification depending on the nature of the DGAs. Results show that the integrated scheme outperformed existing ML and DL methods, and also the subword DL methods.",

While much has been written and analyzed about blockchain terminology and definitions, however, more recent applications and developments potentially hold more both challenges and opportunities for the financial services industry. This research examines the area of tokens, tokenization of physical assets, and the implications this continued shift and development has for both practitioners and academics. Lastly, and after examining implications of blockchain in general for the profession, key questions and considerations are presented for practitioner consideration moving forward. Written with both practitioners and academics in mind, this research covers emerging topics of concern, and recommends possible steps toward resolving several outstanding questions in the blockchain space.",

        "abstract": "There are several alternative strategies that can be used when utilising cryptography to encrypt card information. Encryption's main objective in this situation is to prevent sensitive card information from being intercepted and used fraudulently, including the card number, expiration date, and security code. Using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), which establishes a safe, encrypted connection between a website or app and the server where the card information is stored, is one popular method of encrypting card information. This is frequently used for online transactions, such as when paying with a mobile app or buying something from an e-commerce website. Using end-to-end encryption is an alternative strategy that guarantees that card information is encrypted from the time it is entered into a device, website, or app until it reaches its destination. This is frequently used with tokenization, which exchanges the sensitive card information for a singular token that can be safely kept and used for upcoming transactions without disclosing the actual card data.  Additionally, a number of cryptographic protocols and algorithms, including AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), can be used to encrypt card information. These algorithms and protocols jumble the data using intricate mathematical computations so that it cannot be decoded without the right decryption key.",

        "abstract": "Depending on downstream applications, it is advisable to extend the notion of tokenization from low-level character-based token boundary detection to identification of meaningful and useful language units. This entails both identifying units composed of several single words that form a several single words that form a, as well as splitting single-word compounds into their meaningful parts. In this article, we introduce unsupervised and knowledge-free methods for these two tasks. The main novelty of our research is based on the fact that methods are primarily based on distributional similarity, of which we use two flavors: a sparse count-based and a dense neural-based distributional semantic model. First, we introduce DRUID, which is a method for detecting MWEs. The evaluation on MWE-annotated data sets in two languages and newly extracted evaluation data sets for 32 languages shows that DRUID compares favorably over previous methods not utilizing distributional information. Second, we present SECOS, an algorithm for decompounding close compounds. In an evaluation of four dedicated decompounding data sets across four languages and on data sets extracted from Wiktionary for 14 languages, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over unsupervised baselines, sometimes even matching the performance of previous language-specific and supervised methods. In a final experiment, we show how both decompounding and MWE information can be used in information retrieval. Here, we obtain the best results when combining word information with MWEs and the compound parts in a bag-of-words retrieval set-up. Overall, our methodology paves the way to automatic detection of lexical units beyond standard tokenization techniques without language-specific preprocessing steps such as POS tagging.",
