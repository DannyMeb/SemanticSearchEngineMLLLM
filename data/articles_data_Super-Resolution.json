        "abstract": "In this paper, we explain a process of super-resolution reconstruction allowing to increase the resolution of an image. The need for high-resolution digital images exists in diverse domains, for example, the medical and spatial domains. The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can be made at the time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic with important costs because of the necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of super-resolution reconstruction, consisting of one or several low-resolution images to obtain a high-resolution image. The American patent US 9208537 describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the borders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of interpolation used to add pixels in the aforementioned zone, to increase the neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a lowresolution image and a high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution reconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on an image or a picture library. The demand of Chinese patent CN 107563965 and the scientist publication “Pixel Recursive Super Resolution “, R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, and J. Shlens propose such methods. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct coherent human faces from very degraded pixelated images with a very fast algorithm, faster than the compressed sensing (CS) algorithm, easier to compute and without deep learning, so without important information technology resources, i.e. a large database of thousand of training images ( https://arxiv. org/pdf/2003.13063.pdf). This technological breakthrough has been patented in 2018 with the demand of French patent FR 1855485 (https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3082980A1, see the HAL reference https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal01875898v1)",

It is based on penalized least squares regression and exploits the tensor structure of two-dimensional convolution. A ridge penalty and a difference penalty are combined; the former removes singularities, while the latter eliminates ringing. We exploit the conjugate gradient algorithm to avoid explicit matrix inversion. Large images are handled with ease: zooming a 100 by 100 pixel image to 800 by 800 pixels takes less than a second on an average PC. Several examples, from applications in wide-field fluorescence microscopy, illustrate performance.",

Here we introduce an approach, without using 3D superresolution microscopy or real-time 3D particle tracking, to achieve 3D sub-diffraction-limited information with a spatial resolution of ≤ 1 nm. This is a post-localization analysis that transforms 2D super-resolution images or 2D single-molecule localization distributions into their corresponding 3D spatial probability information. The method has been successfully applied to obtain structural and functional information for 25-300 nm sub-cellular organelles that have rotational symmetry. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive analysis of this method by using experimental data and computational simulations.",

Despite the significant improvement in image quality resulting from improvement in optical sensors and general electronics, camera shake blur significantly undermines the quality of hand-held photographs. We evaluated the state-of-the-art super-resolution convolution neural network(SR-CNN) architecture and proposed a new architecture for SR application inspired by SR-CNN combined with De-blurring. This paper focus super resolution of a de-focussed and motion blurred natural images. Unlike most de-blurring methods that attempt to solve an inverse problem through a variational formulation, deblurring method applied in this work directly estimates the blur kernel by modeling statistical irregularities in the power spectrum of blurred natural images. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method not only generates remarkably clear HR images, but also achieves compelling results in PSNR, MSE and SSIM quantitatively.",

        "abstract": "The super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of generating realistic textures during single image super-resolution. However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied by unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The method is based on depthwise separable convolution super-resolution generative adversarial network (DSCSRGAN). A new depthwise separable convolution dense block (DSC Dense Block) was designed for the generator network, which improved the ability to represent and extract image features, while greatly reducing the total amount of parameters. For the discriminator network, the batch normalization (BN) layer was discarded, and the problem of artifacts was reduced. A frequency energy similarity loss function was designed to constrain the generator network to generate better super-resolution images. Experiments on several different datasets showed that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was improved by more than 3 dB, structural similarity index (SSIM) was increased by 16%, and the total parameter was reduced to 42.8% compared with the original model. Combining various objective indicators and subjective visual evaluation, the algorithm was shown to generate richer image details, clearer texture, and lower complexity.",

        "abstract": "We report that high-density single-molecule super-resolution microscopy can be achieved with a conventional epifluorescence microscope setup and a Mercury arc lamp. The configuration termed as laser-free super-resolution microscopy (LFSM), is an extension of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) techniques and allows single molecules to be switched on and off (a phenomenon termed as “blinking”), detected and localised. The use of a short burst of deep blue excitation (350-380 nm) can be further used to reactivate the blinking, once the blinking process has slowed or stopped. A resolution of 90 nm is achieved on test specimens (mouse and amphibian meiotic chromosomes). Finally, we demonstrate that STED and LFSM can be performed on the same biological sample using a simple commercial mounting medium. It is hoped that this type of correlative imaging will provide a basis for a further enhanced resolution.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous advancement of technology, Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) have played a significant role in the field of image super-resolution, significantly enhancing the resolution of images. However, while SRGAN excels in generating details, sometimes the restored details do not always meet people's expectations. To further enhance the quality of images and make image details clearer, this paper introduces improvements to the architecture and loss functions of the SRGAN network. Specifically, this research draws inspiration from the architecture of ESRGAN, removing the original Batch Normalization layers and introducing a newly designed Residual Block. Leveraging insights from attention mechanisms, we incorporate three layers of convolutional operations and introduce attention mechanisms into these new Residual Blocks. Furthermore, to simplify the computational complexity of the model, this paper simplifies the original loss functions, consolidating the previous four losses into two. These enhancements result in a significantly improved model in capturing visual elements, making key objects in the images more prominent compared to SRGAN. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that this model, while maintaining the clarity of details, provides higher visual quality. These achievements provide valuable insights and inspiration for further research and applications in the field of image super-resolution.",

        "abstract": "A good Super Resolution (SR) algorithm is one of the key successes to filter frequency that creates noise to a picture. Previous research that has published was concluded the Camera SR is the best algorithm to filter this frequency based on their Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) results. However, the current approach to achieving high resolution have not yielded enough signal to filter unwanted pixel. Hence, there is a need to find a better approach to those leads to higher resolution through lower noise reduction. To fulfill this need, this thesis proposed to utilize two proven SR algorithms; Gaussian Denoising and Kernel Blurring. This thesis will not only be obtaining these two existing algorithms in a stand-alone form but hence the combination of them (two combinations) will also be obtained as the new possible algorithms that can be utilized to filter frequency that create noise to a picture. To reach the research objective, the method that will be used is by training a total of four algorithms one by one to a public data set that contains 200 pictures and gets the PSNR and MSE results of each algorithm. Comprehensive experimental results show that all those four SR algorithms outperform previous SR algorithms in commonly used data set with variously higher PSNR by 21% and lower MSE by 5%.",

        "abstract": "Sentinel-2 can provide multi-spectral optical remote sensing images in RGBN bands with a spatial resolution of 10m, but the spatial details provided are not enough for many applications. WorldView can provide HR multi-spectral images less than 2m, but it is a commercial paid resource with relatively high usage costs. In this paper, without any available reference images, Sentinel-2 images at 10m resolution are improved to a resolution of 2.5m through super-resolution (SR) based on deep learning technology. Our model, named DKN-SR-GAN, uses degradation kernel estimation and noise injection to construct a dataset of near-natural low-high-resolution (LHR) image pairs, with only low-resolution (LR) images and no high-resolution (HR) prior information. DKN-SR-GAN uses the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) combined of ESRGAN-type generator, PatchGAN-type discriminator and the VGG-19-type feature extractor, using perceptual loss to optimize the network, so as to obtain SR images with clearer details and better perceptual effects. Experiments demonstrate that in the quantitative comparison of the non-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics like NIQE, BRISQUE and PIQE, as well as the intuitive visual effects of the generated images, compared with state-of-the-art models such as EDSR8-RGB, RCAN and RS-ESRGAN, our proposed model has obvious advantages.",

        "abstract": "Due to its spectral properties, hyperspectral imaging is superior to other types of imaging tools in identifying, distinguishing and classifying objects. Hyperspectral imaging instruments can detect light reflected from certain wavelengths between infrared and ultraviolet, apart from the wavelength that the human eye can distinguish on the electromagnetic spectrum. While this feature provides detailed information about the spectral feature of the object under investigation, it causes its spatial resolution to be low due to the technical overlap between spatial resolution and spectral resolution. Today, applications of hyperspectral images are increasing in important fields such as agriculture, mining, medicine and pharmacy, especially for military purposes. In order for applications to produce more precise results, high spatial resolution is required, as well as high spectral information. Hardware solving of low spatial resolution problem is a difficult and costly method. Therefore, software solution is an interesting area in the field of image processing. In this thesis, a hybrid solution method based on deep learning and sparse representation is proposed to increase the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. The method obtains a super-resolution image from a single hyperspectral image with a low spatial image with a deep convolutional mesh. Later, the super-resolution image obtained and the original low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral image are fused with the dictionary learning method, resulting in a new super-resolution image with high spectral and spatial resolutions. The application results show that our method achieves successful results compared to many super resolution applications in the literature.",

Super Resolution is central to match the resolution of the already existing image content to that of current and future high resolution displays and applications. This dissertation is focused on learning how to upscale images from the statistics of natural images. We build on a sparsity model that uses learned coupled low- and high-resolution dictionaries in order to upscale images, and move towards a more efficient L2 regularization scheme. Instead of using a patch-todictionary decomposition, we propose a fully collaborative neighbor embedding approach. We study the positive impact of antipodally invariant metrics for linear regression frameworks, and extend them by also taking into consideration the dihedral group of transforms (i.e. rotations and reflections), as a group of symmetries within the ...",

        "abstract": "<p>The past decade has witnessed the development of tactile sensors, which have been increasingly considered as an essential equipment in robotics, especially the dexterous manipulation and collaborative human-robot interactions. There are two major types of tactile sensors, i.e., the vision-based and taxel-based sensors. The latter is capable of achieving lower integration complexity with existing robotic systems, but unable to provide high-resolution (HR) tactile information as that of the vision-based counterpart due to the manufacturing limitations. Therefore, we propose a novel tactile pattern super-resolution (SR) scheme for taxel-based sensors, which is a generic scheme enabling customized selection on the number of applied \"tapping\" actions to achieve improvable performance from single tapping SR (STSR) to the multi-tapping SR (MTSR). In addition, we develop a new dataset for the proposed tactile SR scheme. In order to obtain scalable resolutions (e.g. $\\times$4, $\\times$10, $\\times$20, etc.) of ground-truth HR tactile patterns, we propose a novel tactile point spread function (PSF) scheme to generate HR tactile patterns by leveraging the low-resolution (LR) data gathered directly from the taxel-based sensor and the depth information of contact surfaces. This is in strong contrast to the conventional ground-truth generation approach with overlapped multi-sampling and registration strategy, which can only provide a fixed resolution. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme.</p>",

        "abstract": "The recent spread of smartphones and social networking services has increased the means of seeing images of human faces. Particularly, in the face image field, the generation of face images using facial expression transformation has already been realized using deep learning–based approaches. However, in the existing deep learning–based models, only low-resolution images can be generated due to limited computational resources. Consequently, the generated images are blurry or aliasing. To address this problem, we proposed a two-step method to enhance the resolution of the generated facial images by combining a super-resolution network following the generative model, which can be considered a serial model, in our previous work. We further proposed a parallel model that trains a generative adversarial network and a superresolution network through multitask learning. In this paper, we propose a new model that integrates self-supervised guidance encoders into the parallel model to further improve the accuracy of the generated results. Using the peak signalto- noise ratio as an evaluation index, image quality was improved by 0.25 dB for the male test data and 0.28 dB for the female test data compared with our previous multitaskbased parallel model.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Going from low- to high-resolution models is an efficient way to improve the data assimilation process in three ways: it makes better use of high-resolution observations, it represents more accurately the small scale features of the dynamics and it provides a high-resolution field that can further be used as an initial condition of a forecast. Of course, the pitfall of such an approach is the cost of computing a forecast with a high-resolution numerical model. This drawback is even more acute when using an ensemble data assimilation approach, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, for which an ensemble of forecasts is to be issued by the numerical model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our approach, we propose to use a cheap low-resolution model to provide the forecast while still performing the assimilation step in a high-resolution space. The principle of the algorithm is based on a machine learning approach: from a low-resolution forecast, a neural network (NN) emulates a high-resolution field that can then be used to assimilate high-resolution observations. This NN super-resolution operator is trained on one high-resolution simulation. This new data assimilation approach denoted &quot;Super-resolution data assimilation&quot; (SRDA), is built on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We applied SRDA to a quasi-geostrophic model representing simplified ocean dynamics of the surface layer, with a low-resolution up to four times smaller than the reference high-resolution (so the cost of the model is divided by 64). We show that this approach outperforms the standard low-resolution data assimilation approach and the SRDA method using standard interpolation instead of a neural network as a super-resolution operator. For the reduced cost of a low-resolution model, SRDA provides a high-resolution field with an error close to that of the field that would be obtained using a high-resolution model.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "This problem addresses the problem of low-resolution image (noisy) that will proof later by PSNR number. The best way to improve this low-resolution problem is by utilizing Super Resolution (SR) algorithm methodology. SR algorithm methodology refers to the process of obtaining higher-resolution images from several lower-resolution ones, that is resolution enhancement. The quality improvement is caused by fractional-pixel displacements between images. SR allows overcoming the limitations of the imaging system (resolving limit of the sensors) without the need for additional hardware. This research aims to find the best SR algorithm in form of stand-alone algorithm or combine algorithm by comparing with the latest SR algorithm (Camera SR) from the previous research made by Chang Chen et al in 2019. Furthermore, we confidence this research will become the future guideline for anyone who want to improve the limitation of their low-resolution camera or vision sensor by implementing those SR algorithms.",
