        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This paper highlights the potential of using generalized language models to extract structured texts from natural language descriptions of workflows in various industries like healthcare domainOBJECTIVES: Despite the criticality of these workflows to the business, they are often not fully automated or formally specified. Instead, employees may rely on natural language documents to describe the procedures. Text generation methods offer a way to extract structured plans from these natural language documents, which can then be used by an automated system.METHODS: This paper explores the effectiveness of using generalized language models, such as GPT-2, to perform text generation directly from these textsRESULTS: These models have already shown success in multiple text generation tasks, and the paper's initial results suggest that they could also be effective in text generation in healthcare domain. In fact, the paper demonstrates that GPT-2 can generate comparable results to many current text generation methods.CONCLUSION: This suggests that generalized language models can increase the efficiency and accuracy in text generation, where workflows are repetitive and sequential.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSurgical robotics has revolutionized the field of surgery, facilitating complex procedures in operating rooms. However, the current teleoperation systems often rely on bulky consoles, which limit the mobility of surgeons. This restriction reduces surgeons' awareness of the patient during procedures and narrows the range of implementation scenarios. To address these challenges, an alternative solution is proposed: a mixed reality‐based teleoperation system. This system leverages hand gestures, head motion tracking, and speech commands to enable the teleoperation of surgical robots. The implementation focuses on the da Vinci research kit (dVRK) and utilizes the capabilities of Microsoft HoloLens 2. The system's effectiveness is evaluated through camera navigation tasks and peg transfer tasks. The results indicate that, in comparison to manipulator‐based teleoperation, the system demonstrates comparable viability in endoscope teleoperation. However, it falls short in instrument teleoperation, highlighting the need for further improvements in hand gesture recognition and video display quality.",

However, ethical discussions about the impact of CRs on patients, caregivers, healthcare systems, and society are crucial. This normative research seeks to define an integrative and comprehensive ethical framework for CRs, encompassing a wide range of AI-related issues in healthcare. To build the framework, we combine principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explainability by integrating the AI4People framework for a Good AI Society and the traditional bioethics perspective. Using the integrated framework, we conduct an ethical assessment of CRs. Next, we identify three key ethical trade-offs and propose remediation strategies for the technology. Finally, we offer design recommendations for responsible development and usage of CRs.

Nevertheless, simulation falls far from being directly applicable to biorobots due to the large discrepancy between the simulated and the real world. A possible solution for this problem is the further enhancement of existing simulation tools for robotics, AI and neuroscience with multi-physics capabilities. Previously infeasible or difficult to simulate scenarios, such as robots swimming on the water surface, interacting with soft materials, walking on granular materials etc., would be rendered possible within a multi-physics simulation environment designed for robotics. In combination with multi-physics simulation, large-scale simulation tools that integrate multiple simulation modules in a closed-loop manner help address fundamental questions around the organization of neural circuits and the interplay between the brain, body and environment. We analyze existing designs for large-scale simulation running on cloud and HPC infrastructure as well as their shortcomings. Based on this analysis we propose a next-gen modular architecture design based on multi-physics engines, that we believe would greatly benefit biorobotics and AI.",

By harnessing machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI enables the analysis of complex medical data. The integration of AI into healthcare systems aims to support clinicians, personalize patient care, and enhance population health, all while addressing the challenges posed by rising costs and limited resources. As a subdivision of computer science, AI focuses on the development of advanced algorithms capable of performing complex tasks that were once reliant on human intelligence. The ultimate goal is to achieve human-level performance with improved efficiency and accuracy in problem-solving and task execution, thereby reducing the need for human intervention. Various industries, including engineering, media/entertainment, finance, and education, have already reaped significant benefits by incorporating AI systems into their operations. Notably, the healthcare sector has witnessed rapid growth in the utilization of AI technology. Nevertheless, there remains untapped potential for AI to truly revolutionize the industry. It is important to note that despite concerns about job displacement, AI in healthcare should not be viewed as a threat to human workers. Instead, AI systems are designed to augment and support healthcare professionals, freeing up their time to focus on more complex and critical tasks. By automating routine and repetitive tasks, AI can alleviate the burden on healthcare professionals, allowing them to dedicate more attention to patient care and meaningful interactions.

In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Effective control of rehabilitation robots requires considering the distributed and multi-contact point physical human–robot interaction and users’ biomechanical variation. This paper presents a quasi-static model for the motion of a soft robotic exo-digit while physically interacting with an anthropomorphic finger model for physical therapy.Methods: Quasi-static analytical models were developed for modeling the motion of the soft robot, the anthropomorphic finger, and their coupled physical interaction. An intertwining of kinematics and quasi-static motion was studied to model the distributed (multiple contact points) interaction between the robot and a human finger model. The anthropomorphic finger was modeled as an articulated multi-rigid body structure with multi-contact point interaction. The soft robot was modeled as an articulated hybrid soft-and-rigid model with a constant bending curvature and a constant length for each soft segment. A hyperelastic constitute model based on Yeoh’s 3rdorder material model was used for modeling the soft elastomer. The developed models were experimentally evaluated for 1) free motion of individual soft actuators and 2) constrained motion of the soft robotic exo-digit and anthropomorphic finger model.Results and Discussion: Simulation and experimental results were compared for performance evaluations. The theoretical and experimental results were in agreement for free motion, and the deviation from the constrained motion was in the range of the experimental errors. The outcomes also provided an insight into the importance of considering lengthening for the soft actuators.",

        "abstract": "Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT have emerged as potentially valuable technologies to augment human expertise in healthcare. However, uncertainties remain regarding appropriate clinical applications and limitations. This review synthesizes current evidence on using generative AI for clinical decision support, patient data processing, and medical education. Methods: A systematic search of Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases identified 33 relevant studies published in 2023 examining ChatGPT for healthcare uses. Two reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, AI system details, key results, and authors' conclusions. Evidence was synthesized qualitatively using a comparative analysis approach. Results: Supervised use of ChatGPT-generated simulations appeared beneficial for clinical training, but oversight was critical. Numerous studies found risks in relying on ChatGPT's clinical suggestions given frequent factual errors, outdated recommendations, and inappropriate advice. However, ChatGPT demonstrated potential for enhancing workflows via medical documentation automation. Conclusions: While showing promise for constrained uses like supervised education and documentation, findings caution against open-ended ChatGPT integration in clinical practice currently. Additional large-scale comparative effectiveness research is imperative to establish evidence-based implementation guidance. Responsible translation requires governance, validation against literature, and focus on human-AI collaboration versus replacement. Further inquiry can illuminate best practices for balancing innovation and safety.",

        "abstract": "In the past 2 decades, there has been increasing interest in autonomous multi-robot systems for space use. They can assemble space structures and provide services for other space assets. The utmost significance lies in the performance, stability, and robustness of these space operations. By considering system dynamics and constraints, the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizes performance. Unlike other methods, standard MPC can offer greater robustness due to its receding horizon nature. However, current literature on MPC application to space robotics primarily focuses on linear models, which is not suitable for highly non-linear multi-robot systems. Although Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) shows promise for free-floating space manipulators, current NMPC applications are limited to unconstrained non-linear systems and do not guarantee closed-loop stability. This paper introduces a novel approach to NMPC using the concept of passivity to multi-robot systems for space applications. By utilizing a passivity-based state constraint and a terminal storage function, the proposed PNMPC scheme ensures closed-loop stability and a superior performance. Therefore, this approach offers an alternative method to the control Lyapunov function for control of non-linear multi-robot space systems and applications, as stability and passivity exhibit a close relationship. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the benefits of passivity-based concepts and NMPC can be combined into a single NMPC scheme that maintains the advantages of each, including closed-loop stability through passivity and good performance through one-line optimization in NMPC.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, robotics applications requiring the execution of complex tasks in real-world scenarios are still facing many challenges related to highly unstructured and dynamic environments in domains such as emergency response and search and rescue where robots have to operate for prolonged periods trading off computational performance with increased power autonomy and vice versa. In particular, there is a crucial need for robots capable of adapting to such settings while at the same time providing robustness and extended power autonomy. A possible approach to overcome the conflicting demand of a computational performing system with the need for long power autonomy is represented by cloud robotics, which can boost the computational capabilities of the robot while reducing the energy consumption by exploiting the offload of resources to the cloud. Nevertheless, the communication constraint due to limited bandwidth, latency, and connectivity, typical of field robotics, makes cloud-enabled robotics solutions challenging to deploy in real-world applications. In this context, we designed and realized the XBot2D software architecture, which provides a hybrid cloud manager capable of dynamically and seamlessly allocating robotics skills to perform a distributed computation based on the current network condition and the required latency, and computational/energy resources of the robot in use. The proposed framework leverage on the two dimensions, i.e., 2D (local and cloud), in a transparent way for the user, providing support for Real-Time (RT) skills execution on the local robot, as well as machine learning and A.I. resources on the cloud with the possibility to automatically relocate the above based on the required performances and communication quality. XBot2D implementation and its functionalities are presented and validated in realistic tasks involving the CENTAURO robot and the Amazon Web Service Elastic Computing Cloud (AWS EC2) infrastructure with different network conditions.",

Various governing and advisory bodies have generated sets of broad ethical principles, which institutional decisionmakers are encouraged to apply to particular practical decisions. Although much of this literature examines the ethics of designing and developing AI and robotics, medical institutions typically must make purchase and deployment decisions about technologies that have already been designed and developed. The primary problem facing medical institutions is not one of ethical design but of ethical deployment. The purpose of this paper is to develop a practical model by which medical institutions may make ethical deployment decisions about ready-made advanced technologies. Our slogan is “more process, less principles.” Ethically sound decisionmaking requires that the process by which medical institutions make such decisions include participatory, deliberative, and conservative elements. We argue that our model preserves the strengths of existing frameworks, avoids their shortcomings, and delivers its own moral, practical, and epistemic advantages.",

In conclusion, our method is effective for the identification of hearing loss.",

        "abstract": "Portfolio management involves the critical task of determining the optimal times to enter or exit a stock in order to maximize profits in the stock market. Unfortunately, many retail investors struggle with this task due to unclear investment objectives and a lack of a structured decision-making process. With the vast number of stocks available in the market, it can be difficult for investors to determine which stocks to invest in. As a result, there is a growing need for the development of effective investment decision support systems to assist investors in making informed decisions. Researchers have explored various approaches to building such systems, including predicting stock prices using sentiment analysis of news, articles, and social media, as well as historical trends and patterns. However, the impact of financial reports filed by companies on stock prices has not been extensively studied. This paper aims to address this gap by using machine learning techniques to develop a more accurate stock prediction model based on financial reports from companies in the Nifty 50. The financial reports considered include quarterly reports, annual reports, cash flow statements, and ratios.",

The number of cases being treated with RPMS has increased since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still challenges to be met, such as mobility, heterogeneous networks, standardisation of RPMSs, automation, and Quality of Service (QoS), despite the rise in their use. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into remote patient monitoring (RPM) is causing a revolution in the healthcare industry by improving the quality of care provided to patients, boosting operational effectiveness, and making it possible to intervene earlier. RPM makes use of technology to monitor the health of patients in a remote location, hence minimising the frequency of in-person visits that are required. The addition of AI algorithms further enhances the potential of RPM by analysing huge volumes of patient data to identify patterns, abnormalities, and potential problems. In this study, we will investigate the most potentially game-changing applications of AI in remote patient monitoring in 2023 and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by some traits of human intelligence, it is proposed that wetware approaches based on molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry can provide valuable models and tools for novel forms of robotics and AI, being constituted by soft matter and fluid states as the human nervous system and, more generally, life, is. Bottom-up mimicries of intelligence range from the molecular world to the multicellular level, i.e., from the Ångström (10−10 meters) to the micrometer scales (10−6 meters), and allows the development of unconventional chemical robotics. Whereas conventional robotics lets humans explore and colonise otherwise inaccessible environments, such as the deep oceanic abysses and other solar system planets, chemical robots will permit us to inspect and control the microscopic molecular and cellular worlds. This article suggests that systems made of properly chosen molecular compounds can implement all those modules that are the fundamental ingredients of every living being: sensory, processing, actuating, and metabolic networks. Autonomous chemical robotics will be within reach when such modules are compartmentalised and assembled. The design of a strongly intertwined web of chemical robots, with or without the involvement of living matter, will give rise to collective forms of intelligence that will probably reproduce, on a minimal scale, some sophisticated performances of the human intellect and will implement forms of “general AI.” These remarkable achievements will require a productive interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, biotechnologists, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers to be achieved. The principal purpose of this paper is to spark this revolutionary collaborative scientific endeavour.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Preventive control is a critical feature in autonomous technology to ensure safe system operations. One application where safety is most important is robot-assisted needle interventions. During incisions into a tissue, adverse events such as mechanical buckling of the needle shaft and tissue displacements can occur on encounter with stiff membranes causing potential damage to the organ.Methods: To prevent these events before they occur, we propose a new control subroutine that autonomously chooses a) a reactive mechanism to stop the insertion procedure when a needle buckling or a severe tissue displacement event is predicted and b) an adaptive mechanism to continue the insertion procedure through needle steering control when a mild tissue displacement is detected. The subroutine is developed using a model-free control technique due to the nonlinearities of the unknown needle-tissue dynamics. First, an improved version of the model-free adaptive control (IMFAC) is developed by computing a fast time-varying partial pseudo derivative analytically from the dynamic linearization equation to enhance output convergence and robustness against external disturbances.Results and Discussion: Comparing IMFAC and MFAC algorithms on simulated nonlinear systems in MATLAB, IMFAC shows 20% faster output convergence against arbitrary disturbances. Next, IMFAC is integrated with event prediction algorithms from prior work to prevent adverse events during needle insertions in real time. Needle insertions in gelatin tissues with known environments show successful prevention of needle buckling and tissue displacement events. Needle insertions in biological tissues with unknown environments are performed using live fluoroscopic imaging as ground truth to verify timely prevention of adverse events. Finally, statistical ANOVA analysis on all insertion data shows the robustness of the prevention algorithm to various needles and tissue environments. Overall, the success rate of preventing adverse events in needle insertions through adaptive and reactive control was 95%, which is important toward achieving safety in robotic needle interventions.",

        "abstract": "Robot perception heavily relies on camera-based visual input for navigating and interacting in its environment. As robots become integral parts of various applications, the need to efficiently compute their visibility regions in complex environments has grown. The key challenge addressed in this paper is to devise an innovative solution that not only accurately computes the visibility region V of a robot operating in a polynomial environment but also optimizes memory utilization to ensure real-time performance and scalability.The main objective of this research is to propose an algorithm that achieves optimal-time complexity and significantly reduces memory requirements for visibility region computation. By focusing on sub-linear memory utilization, we aim to enhance the robot's ability to perceive its surroundings effectively and efficiently.Previous approaches have provided solutions for visibility region computation in non-spiral environments, but most were not tailored to memory limitations. In contrast, the proposed algorithm is designed to achieve optimal time complexity that is O(n) while reducing memory usage to O(c/log n) variables, where c < n represents the number of critical corners in the environment. Leveraging the constant-memory model and memory-constrained algorithm, we aim to strike a balance between computational efficiency and memory usage.The algorithm's performance is rigorously evaluated through extensive simulations and practical experiments. The results demonstrate its linear-time complexity and substantial reduction in memory usage without compromising the accuracy of the visibility region computation. By efficiently handling memory constraints, the robot gains a cost-effective and reliable perception mechanism, making it well-suited for a wide range of real-world applications.The constant-memory model and memory-constrained algorithm presented in this paper offer a significant advancement in robot perception capabilities. By optimizing the visibility region computation in polynomial environments, our approach contributes to the efficient operation of robots, enhancing their performance and applicability in complex real-world scenarios. The results of this research hold promising potential for future developments in robotics, computer vision, and related fields.",

In this work, we qualitatively and quantitatively assess the content and scientific support for claims about social robots for children made on manufacturers’ websites. A sample of 21 robot websites was obtained using location-independent keyword searches on Google, Yahoo, and Bing from April to July 2021. All claims made on manufacturers’ websites about robot functionality and outcomes (n = 653 statements) were subjected to content analysis, and the quality of evidence for these claims was evaluated using a validated quality evaluation tool. Social robot manufacturers made clear claims about the impact of their products in the areas of interaction, education, emotion, and adaptivity. Claims tended to focus on the child rather than the parent or other users. Robots were primarily described in the context of interactive, educational, and emotional uses, rather than being for health, safety, or security. The quality of the information used to support these claims was highly variable and at times potentially misleading. Many websites used language implying that robots had interior thoughts and experiences; for example, that they would love the child. This study provides insight into the content and quality of parent-facing manufacturer claims regarding commercial social robots for children.",

        "abstract": "During the recent decade, we have witnessed an extraordinary flourishing of soft robotics. Rekindled interest in soft robots is partially associated with the advances in manufacturing techniques that enable the fabrication of sophisticated multi-material robotic bodies with dimensions ranging across multiple length scales. In recent manuscripts, a reader might find peculiar-looking soft robots capable of grasping, walking, or swimming. However, the growth in publication numbers does not always reflect the real progress in the field since many manuscripts employ very similar ideas and just tweak soft body geometries. Therefore, we unreservedly agree with the sentiment that future research must move beyond “soft for soft’s sake.” Soft robotics is an undoubtedly fascinating field, but it requires a critical assessment of the limitations and challenges, enabling us to spotlight the areas and directions where soft robots will have the best leverage over their traditional counterparts. In this perspective paper, we discuss the current state of robotic research related to such important aspects as energy autonomy, electronic-free logic, and sustainability. The goal is to critically look at perspectives of soft robotics from two opposite points of view provided by early career researchers and highlight the most promising future direction, that is, in our opinion, the employment of soft robotic technologies for soft bio-inspired artificial organs.",

        "abstract": "Precision agriculture heavily relies on accurately segmenting wheat canopies from chlorophyll fluorescence (CHF) images. However, these images often face challenges due to inherent noise and illumination variations, primarily induced by the thermal activity of photons emitting a fluorescence effect. The unique nature of fluorescence introduces variations in illumination, especially during the crop's dark adaptation before experimentation. This adaptation aims to capture the full fluorescence effect, starting from minimum fluorescence and progressing to maximum fluorescence. In the initial stages of fluorescence, images tend to appear darker compared to those progressing towards maximum fluorescence. This variability necessitates the development of a sophisticated hybrid approach to eliminate noise and enhance contrast collaboratively, maximizing the benefits derived from CHF images. This paper introduces a novel hybrid preprocessing approach designed to address these challenges. The proposed method integrates five denoising techniques, namely Discrete Cosine Transform, Block Matching-3D, Low-Rank Matrix Approximation, Wiener Filtering, and Median Filtering, to mitigate the impact of noise in CHF images. Simultaneously, two enhancement techniques, Adaptive Histogram Specification and Gamma Correction, are employed to accentuate critical features, compensating for inherent variations in illumination during the fluorescence process. The hybrid preprocessing technique was proposed after analysing different combinations of denoising and enhancement techniques. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results, it was observed that Block Matching-3D denoising with Gamma Correction produced the best output, with an Average PSNR of 0.54 and Average MSE of 0.07. This cascaded approach not only emphasizes noise reduction but also prioritizes the enhancement of crucial information within CHF images. By synergistically combining denoising and enhancement methods, the proposed approach optimizes the overall quality of the images, laying a foundation for improved wheat canopy segmentation. This research contributes a comprehensive and innovative solution to the challenges associated with CHF images in precision agriculture. The proposed hybrid approach holds promise for advancing the accuracy and reliability of wheat canopy segmentation, thereby enhancing the efficacy of precision agricultural practices. ",

        "abstract": "Infertility is a social stigma for individuals, and male factors cause approximately 30% of infertility. Despite this, male infertility is underrecognized and underrepresented as a disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), changes in lifestyle and environmental factors are the prime reasons for the declining rate of male fertility. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) models have become an effective solution for early fertility detection. Seven industry-standard ML models are used: support vector machine, random forest (RF), decision tree, logistic regression, naïve bayes, adaboost, and multi-layer perception to detect male fertility. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) are vital tools that examine the feature’s impact on each model’s decision making. On these, we perform a comprehensive comparative study to identify good and poor classification models. While dealing with the all-above-mentioned models, the RF model achieves an optimal accuracy and area under curve (AUC) of 90.47% and 99.98%, respectively, by considering five-fold cross-validation (CV) with the balanced dataset. Furthermore, we provide the SHAP explanations of existing models that attain good and poor performance. The findings of this study show that decision making (based on ML models) with SHAP provides thorough explanations for detecting male fertility, as well as a reference for clinicians for further treatment planning.",

This study aimed to determine the acceptability, perceptions of safety, and concerns among the patients, visitors, and polyclinic healthcare workers (HCWs) regarding the HIRO. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted from March to April 2022 when the HIRO was at Tampines Polyclinic in eastern Singapore. A total of 170 multidisciplinary HCWs serve approximately 1,000 patients and visitors daily at this polyclinic. The sample size of 385 was computed using a proportion of 0.5, 5% precision, and 95% confidence interval. Research assistants administered an e-survey to gather demographic data and feedback from 300 patients/visitors and 85 HCWs on their perceptions of the HIRO using Likert scales. The participants watched a video on the HIRO’s functionalities and were given the opportunity to directly interact with it. Descriptive statistics was performed and figures were presented in frequencies and percentages. The majority of the participants viewed the HIRO’s functionalities favourably: sanitising (96.7%/91.2%); checking proper mask donning (97%/89.4%); temperature monitoring (97%/91.7%); ushering (91.7%/81.1%); perceived user friendliness (93%/88.3%), and improvement in the clinic experience (96%/94.2%). A minority of the participants perceived harm from the HIRO’s liquid disinfectant (29.6%/31.5%) and that its voice-annotated instructions may be upsetting (14%/24.8%). Most of the participants accepted the HIRO’s deployment at the polyclinic and perceived it to be safe. The HIRO used ultraviolet irradiation for sanitisation during after-clinic hours instead of disinfectants due to the perceived harm.",

By utilizing soft robotics, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change on human society and the natural world through fostering adaptation, restoration, and remediation. Moreover, the implementation of soft robotics can lead to groundbreaking discoveries in material science, biology, control systems, energy efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing processes. However, to achieve these goals, we need further improvements in understanding biological principles at the basis of embodied and physical intelligence, environment-friendly materials, and energy-saving strategies to design and manufacture self-piloting and field-ready soft robots. This paper provides insights on how soft robotics can address the pressing issue of environmental sustainability. Sustainable manufacturing of soft robots at a large scale, exploring the potential of biodegradable and bioinspired materials, and integrating onboard renewable energy sources to promote autonomy and intelligence are some of the urgent challenges of this field that we discuss in this paper. Specifically, we will present field-ready soft robots that address targeted productive applications in urban farming, healthcare, land and ocean preservation, disaster remediation, and clean and affordable energy, thus supporting some of the SDGs. By embracing soft robotics as a solution, we can concretely support economic growth and sustainable industry, drive solutions for environment protection and clean energy, and improve overall health and well-being.",

For us humans, this challenge is simplified by the commonsense knowledge we can access. For cognitive robotics, representing and acquiring commonsense knowledge is a relevant problem, so we perform a systematic literature review to investigate the current state of commonsense knowledge exploitation in cognitive robotics. For this review, we combine a keyword search on six search engines with a snowballing search on six related reviews, resulting in 2,048 distinct publications. After applying pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, we analyse the remaining 52 publications. Our focus lies on the use cases and domains for which commonsense knowledge is employed, the commonsense aspects that are considered, the datasets/resources used as sources for commonsense knowledge and the methods for evaluating these approaches. Additionally, we discovered a divide in terminology between research from the knowledge representation and reasoning and the cognitive robotics community.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Patients who are hospitalized may be at a higher risk for falling, which can result in additional injuries, longer hospitalizations, and extra cost for healthcare organizations. A frequent context for these falls is when a hospitalized patient needs to use the bathroom. While it is possible that “high-tech” tools like robots and AI applications can help, adopting a human-centered approach and engaging users and other affected stakeholders in the design process can help to maximize benefits and avoid unintended consequences.Methods: Here, we detail our findings from a human-centered design research effort to investigate how the process of toileting a patient can be ameliorated through the application of advanced tools like robots and AI. We engaged healthcare professionals in interviews, focus groups, and a co-creation session in order to recognize common barriers in the toileting process and find opportunities for improvement.Results: In our conversations with participants, who were primarily nurses, we learned that toileting is more than a nuisance for technology to remove through automation. Nurses seem keenly aware and responsive to the physical and emotional pains experienced by patients during the toileting process, and did not see technology as a feasible or welcomed substitute. Instead, nurses wanted tools which supported them in providing this care to their patients. Participants envisioned tools which helped them anticipate and understand patient toileting assistance needs so they could plan to assist at convenient times during their existing workflows. Participants also expressed favorability towards mechanical assistive features which were incorporated into existing equipment to ensure ubiquitous availability when needed without adding additional mass to an already cramped and awkward environment.Discussion: We discovered that the act of toileting served more than one function, and can be viewed as a valuable touchpoint in which nurses can assess, support, and encourage their patients to engage in their own recovery process as they perform a necessary and normal function of life. While we found opportunities for technology to make the process safer and less burdensome for patients and clinical staff alike, we believe that designers should preserve and enhance the therapeutic elements of the nurse-patient interaction rather than eliminate it through automation.",

Despite the urgency to develop AI solutions for COVID-19 problems, considering the ethical implications of those solutions remains critical. Implementing ethics frameworks in AI-based healthcare applications is a wicked issue that calls for an inclusive, and transparent participatory process. In this qualitative study, we set up a participatory process to explore assumptions and expectations about ethical issues associated with development of a COVID-19 monitoring AI-based app from a diverse group of stakeholders including patients, physicians, and technology developers. We also sought to understand the influence the consultative process had on the participants’ understanding of the issues. Eighteen participants were presented with a fictitious AI-based app whose features included individual self-monitoring of potential infection, physicians’ remote monitoring of symptoms for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and tracking of infection clusters by health agencies. We found that implementing an ethics framework is systemic by nature, and that ethics principles and stakeholders need to be considered in relation to one another. We also found that the AI app introduced a novel channel for knowledge between the stakeholders. Mapping the flow of knowledge has the potential to illuminate ethical issues in a holistic way.",

        "abstract": "Chemical Artificial Intelligence (CAI) is a brand-new research line that exploits molecular, supramolecular, and systems chemistry in wetware (i.e., in fluid solutions) to imitate some performances of human intelligence and promote unconventional robotics based on molecular assemblies, which act in the microscopic world, otherwise tough to be accessed by humans. It is undoubtedly worth spreading the news that AI researchers can rely on the help of chemists and biotechnologists to reach the ambitious goals of building intelligent systems from scratch. This article reports the first attempt at building a Chemical Artificial Intelligence knowledge map and describes the basic intelligent functions that can be implemented through molecular and supramolecular chemistry. Chemical Artificial Intelligence provides new tools and concepts to mimic human intelligence because it shares, with biological intelligence, the same principles and materials. It enables peculiar dynamics, possibly not accessible in software and hardware domains. Moreover, the development of Chemical Artificial Intelligence will contribute to a deeper understanding of the strict link between intelligence and life, which are two of the most remarkable emergent properties shown by the Complex Systems we call biological organisms.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the threat of cyberattacks has been increasing annually, necessitating organizations to prioritize security measures. This urgency is particularly critical in healthcare institutions, given their status as crucial infrastructures and the potential risks cyberattacks pose to human lives. However, limited IT investment in healthcare institutions has resulted in inadequate cybersecurity measures and underinvestment in IT infrastructure. Outdated and unsupported operating systems pose significant vulnerabilities, escalating the risk of security incidents. Despite the challenges imposed by limited IT investment, organizations must strive to develop resilience that enables swift recovery in the event of a security incident, even while accepting a certain level of risk. As it stands now, healthcare institutions that have gotten cyberattacks are hesitant to disclose some of the findings of security incidents involving vulnerabilities that have occurred at healthcare institutions because they reveal vulnerabilities within the industry and suggest the possibility of further cyber-attacks. However, NIST SP800-61, which is also a guideline for computer incident response, states that it is important to prepare for the next security incident by learning lessons from past security incidents. In the first half of this study, security incidents that have occurred in healthcare institutions in the past are discussed and issues are organized using the PPT (People, Process, and Technology) framework used to examine cybersecurity measures. In this study, issues were organized based on two hospital incident cases that occurred in Japan in 2021 and 2022 and for which investigation reports were issued.In terms of People (organizations), the lack of security personnel is positioned as the cause of incidents. However, healthcare institutions prioritize patient care, and for economic reasons, there is also the issue of difficulty in securing not only security personnel but also IT personnel.In terms of Process, the issues were that the information collection system for urgent vulnerabilities and the patch application process were not in place, and the password policy was not well maintained and was weak. In terms of Technology, the vulnerability of the equipment and systems had not been addressed, and the anti-virus system was not in operation. Due to the compatibility of the electronic healthcare record system, it was not possible to update the equipment or run the anti-virus.The second half of the paper will focus on People and Processes in particular, and organize their roles in the incident response phase using the Incident Command System (ICS). In a normal ICS, the five actors are Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics, Finance, and Administration, but since many of the roles played by the legal department could be read from the incident case studies, a resilience matrix was organized to identify the relevant actors.  In the future, we will further discuss the practicality of the resilience matrix and the triggers and considerations for shifting to the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) when responding to an incident by applying the results of previous studies, such as incident response exercises.",

Although implementing standards for AI is currently a preferred solution for many, this article argues that, on their own, standards may not provide sufficient capability and flexibility. An argument is presented that cyber norms of zero trust for AI (ZTAI) alongside standards are essential for the security of AI, along with a call to action.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous advancement of robotics technology, the integration of robots into diverse human environments has become increasingly prevalent. However, the presence of robots in public spaces can often elicit discomfort or unease among individuals. To address this concern, the concept of concealing robots in various settings has emerged as an innovative approach to improve robot navigation and interaction while minimizing intrusion on human privacy. This paper explores the motivations, challenges, and potential benefits of hiding robots in different environments, particularly within the context of swarm robotics where multiple interconnected robots form a cohesive swarm. Equipped with onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities, these robots can autonomously interact with each other and adapt to the environment.The paper investigates the problem of maximizing the number of hidden orthogonal swarm robots, considering scenarios in which robots need to navigate and operate within polygonal environments. Specifically, it presents a 4-approximation algorithm for computing a maximum hidden robot set in such environments. The algorithm offers a practical solution for determining an efficient arrangement of robots that minimizes their visibility while ensuring effective swarm operation.By concealing robots in diverse environments, several benefits can be achieved. First, it helps to alleviate discomfort or unease among individuals, allowing for smoother integration of robots into public spaces. Additionally, concealing robots enhances their navigation capabilities by leveraging stealth techniques, allowing them to move seamlessly and unobtrusively within the environment. This approach also promotes improved human-robot interaction, as the reduced visibility of the robots can alleviate concerns and foster a more natural and comfortable interaction between humans and robots. The paper sheds light on the current state of the field, discussing the motivations behind concealing robots in different settings and highlighting the challenges that need to be addressed. Furthermore, it presents insights into future directions, including the development of more advanced stealth technologies, ethical frameworks for integrating hidden robots, and the potential impact on urban planning and infrastructure. In conclusion, hiding robots in diverse environments offers a promising approach to enhancing robot navigation, interaction, and privacy. The research presented in this paper contributes to the understanding of this emerging field and provides a foundation for further exploration and development of hiding strategies for swarm robotics in various settings.",

        "abstract": "Surface defect detection is crucial in maintaining product quality across various industries. Traditional manual inspection methods are often time-consuming and subjective, which can result in inaccuracies and higher production costs. With the use of deep learning techniques, significant advancements have been made in automating the process of surface defect detection in recent years. Moreover, deep learning includes a variety of techniques, and image recognition-based deep learning is especially relevant to our field of study, which is the main focus of this research paper.In the industrial surface defect detection field, researchers have always aimed to create a deep learning-based intelligent defect detection system that achieves near-zero defect rates while maintaining a lightweight, efficient, and cost-effective solution. However, these objectives often conflict with each other, and it is unrealistic to develop a model that can achieve all of them simultaneously. Some trade-offs must be made. If accuracy is the top priority, a large amount of defective data labeled for supervised learning is usually required. If lightweight and low cost is prioritized, a simple small model such as Auto-Encoder is usually used, along with a large number of flawless images for unsupervised learning to minimize the cost of labeling.As mentioned before, it is very difficult to design a single model that can achieve all of them simultaneously. However, present-day studies frequently center on accomplishing those tasks using a single model and rarely address the multi-model architecture. This paper presents a Surface Defect Detection and Classification System that builds on the current state-of-the-art model in the field of surface defect detection, along with the zero-shot learning (ZSL) classifier based on VAEGAN and the Variational Auto-Encoder developed by our laboratory.We have developed a Surface Defect Detection and Classification System that effectively integrates the aforementioned three models. It has been validated on a dataset of metal surface defects, yielding excellent results. This system not only achieves defect detection rates that comply with industrial standards and low false positive rates but also maintains characteristics such as lightweight, low latency, and low annotation cost. In addition to achieving the above goals, this system can also instantly identify and issue anomaly notifications when there are unseen anomalies, which is generally impossible to do with supervised learning anomaly detection models.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the advancement in the large language models, often called LLMs, there has been increasing concerns around the usage of these models. As they can generate human-like text and can also perform a number of tasks such as generating code, question answering, essay writing and even generating text for research papers.OBJECTIVES: The generated text is subject to the usage of the original data (using which models are trained) which might be protected or may be personal/private data. The detailed description of such concerns and various potential solutions is discussed in ‘Generative language models and automated influence operations: Emerging threats and potential mitigations’. METHODS: Addressing these concerns becomes the paramount for LLMs usability. There are several directions explored by the researchers and one of the interesting works is around building content aware models. The idea is that the model is aware of the type of content it is learning from and aware what type of content should be used to generate a response to a specific query.RESULTS: In our work we explored direction by applying poisoning techniques to contaminate data and then applying genetic algorithms to extract the non-poisoned content from the poisoned content that can generate a good response when paraphrased.CONCLUSION: While we demonstrated the idea using poisoning techniques and tried to make the model aware of copyrighted content, the same can be extended to detect other types of contents or any other use cases where content awareness is required.",

        "abstract": "Data classification in the real world is often faced with the challenge of data imbalance, where there is asignificant difference in the number of instances among different classes. Dealing with imbalanced data isrecognized as a challenging problem in data mining, as it involves identifying minority-class data with ahigh number of errors. Therefore, the selection of unique and appropriate features for classifying data withsmaller classes poses a fundamental challenge in this research. Nowadays, due to the widespread presenceof imbalanced medical data in many real-world problems, the processing of such data has gained attentionfrom researchers. The objective of this research is to propose a method for classifying imbalanced medicaldata. In this paper, the hypothyroidism dataset from the UCI repository is used. In the feature selection stage,a support vector machine algorithm is used as a cost function, and the wrapper algorithm is employed asa search strategy to achieve an optimal subset of features. The proposed method achieves high accuracy,reaching 99.6% accuracy for data classification through the optimization of a neural network using learningautomata.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) describes computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Examples of AI techniques are machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. AI can be applied in many different areas, such as econometrics, biometry, e-commerce, and the automotive industry. In recent years, AI has found its way into healthcare as well, helping doctors make better decisions (“clinical decision support”), localizing tumors in magnetic resonance images, reading and analyzing reports written by radiologists and pathologists, and much more. However, AI has one big risk: it can be perceived as a “black box”, limiting trust in its reliability, which is a very big issue in an area in which a decision can mean life or death. As a result, the term Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been gaining momentum. XAI tries to ensure that AI algorithms (and the resulting decisions) can be understood by humans. In this narrative review, we will have a look at some central concepts in XAI, describe several challenges around XAI in healthcare, and discuss whether it can really help healthcare to advance, for example, by increasing understanding and trust. Finally, alternatives to increase trust in AI are discussed, as well as future research possibilities in the area of XAI.",

        "abstract": "The scholarly discourse surrounding the manifold advantages, applications, and limitations of implementing Virtual Reality (VR) in the contemporary milieu has burgeoned over time. VR holds immense potential, attracting fervent interest from governmental and private entities alike. Nevertheless, the existing body of literature pertaining to the expanding utilization of VR in diverse economic sectors remains scant. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to furnish a comprehensive literature review encompassing VR applications across various economic domains while elucidating concerns surrounding its integration within engineering education. A total of 108 publications were extracted from prominent databases such as Scopus, Elsevier, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, with a subsequent review of 51 relevant works. These scrutinized journals were published between 2015 and 2022 and were predominantly authored in English. The reviewed publications encompassed VR applications in education, robotics, healthcare, transportation, sports, agriculture, governance, security, and media. The study’s findings unveiled significant advancements in VR implementation within engineering education, medical training, cognitive augmentation, aircraft assembly, governance, and diverse other spheres. Notwithstanding these achievements, impediments to VR deployment were identified, stemming from financial exigencies, cultural and conventional norms, with scant evidence of VR’s prevalence in underdeveloped nations, given that all the assessed research originated from developed economies. Additionally, the limitations of this review encompassed a small sample size and a narrowly focused demographic in the examined articles. Nevertheless, despite these constraints, the research highlights substantial progress in VR utilization over the preceding decade.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to explore patient experiences with AI in healthcare settings, identifying their perceptions, concerns, and the perceived impact of AI on their care. The objective is to provide insights into patient attitudes towards AI, which can inform the development, implementation, and policy-making of AI technologies in healthcare. We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 26 participants who have interacted with AI-driven healthcare services. Participants were selected to represent a diverse range of ages, backgrounds, and experiences. Thematic analysis was employed to identify major themes and categories from the interview data, focusing on patient perceptions, experiences, and expectations of AI in healthcare. Five major themes emerged from the data: Understanding and Perceptions; Quality and Accessibility; Integration and Adaptation; Operational Challenges; and Patient Empowerment and Engagement. These themes encompassed various categories, including AI literacy, privacy concerns, care personalization, technical issues, and patient rights, among others. The findings highlight a general optimism about the potential of AI to improve healthcare outcomes, coupled with significant concerns about data privacy, ethical use, and the need for greater patient education and involvement in AI development. Patients perceive AI as a potentially transformative force in healthcare but underscore the importance of addressing ethical considerations, ensuring transparency, and enhancing patient engagement in the deployment of AI technologies. The study advocates for a patient-centered approach in the development and implementation of AI in healthcare to maximize its benefits while mitigating challenges.",

As such, my aim in this paper is to start building a bridge between traditional cognitive models and contemporary embodied and ecological approaches to cognitive science. To achieve this task, I offer a perspective on a model that would combine elements of ecological psychology (especially affordances) and the Learning Intelligent Decision Agent (LIDA) cognitive architecture. Jeff Pressing’s cognitive model of musical improvisation will also be a central link between these elements. While some overlap between these three areas already exists, there are several points of tension between them, notably concerning the nature of perception and the function of artificial general intelligence modeling.

However, there is scant literature guiding their integration for non-AI professionals. This study conducts a scoping literature review to address the critical need for guidance on integrating generative AI and LLMs into healthcare and medical practices. It elucidates the distinct mechanisms underpinning these technologies, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLFH), including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning, which differentiates them from traditional, rule-based AI systems. It requires an inclusive, collaborative co-design process that engages all pertinent stakeholders, including clinicians and consumers, to achieve these benefits. Although global research is examining both opportunities and challenges, including ethical and legal dimensions, LLMs offer promising advancements in healthcare by enhancing data management, information retrieval, and decision-making processes. Continued innovation in data acquisition, model fine-tuning, prompt strategy development, evaluation, and system implementation is imperative for realizing the full potential of these technologies. Organizations should proactively engage with these technologies to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency, adhering to ethical and legal guidelines for responsible application.",

        "abstract": "Using human tools can significantly benefit robots in many application domains. Such ability would allow robots to solve problems that they were unable to without tools. However, robot tool use is a challenging task. Tool use was initially considered to be the ability that distinguishes human beings from other animals. We identify three skills required for robot tool use: perception, manipulation, and high-level cognition skills. While both general manipulation tasks and tool use tasks require the same level of perception accuracy, there are unique manipulation and cognition challenges in robot tool use. In this survey, we first define robot tool use. The definition highlighted the skills required for robot tool use. The skills coincide with an affordance model which defined a three-way relation between actions, objects, and effects. We also compile a taxonomy of robot tool use with insights from animal tool use literature. Our definition and taxonomy lay a theoretical foundation for future robot tool use studies and also serve as practical guidelines for robot tool use applications. We first categorize tool use based on the context of the task. The contexts are highly similar for the same task (e.g., cutting) innon-causal tool use, while the contexts forcausal tool useare diverse. We further categorize causal tool use based on the task complexity suggested in animal tool use studies intosingle-manipulation tool useandmultiple-manipulation tool use. Single-manipulation tool use are sub-categorized based on tool features and prior experiences of tool use. This type of tool may be considered as building blocks of causal tool use. Multiple-manipulation tool use combines these building blocks in different ways. The different combinations categorize multiple-manipulation tool use. Moreover, we identify different skills required in each sub-type in the taxonomy. We then review previous studies on robot tool use based on the taxonomy and describe how the relations are learned in these studies. We conclude with a discussion of the current applications of robot tool use and open questions to address future robot tool use.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWith the emergence of AI systems to assist clinical decision-making, several ethical dilemmas are brought to the general attention. AI systems are claimed to be the solution for many high-skilled medical tasks where machines can potentially surpass human ability as for example in identifying normal and abnormal chest X-rays. However, there are also warns that AI tools could be the basis for a human replacement that can risk dehumanisation in medicine. In recent years, important proposals in the domain of AI ethics in healthcare have identified main ethical issues, as for example fairness, autonomy, transparency, and responsibility. The human warranty, which implies human evaluation of the AI procedures, has been described to lower the ethical risks. However, as relevant these works have been, translating principles into action has proved challenging as existing codes were mostly a description of principles. There is a great need to produce how-to proposals that are specific enough to be action-guiding. We present five human-focussed facts designed into a framework of human action for an ethical AI in healthcare. Through the factors, we examine the role of medical practitioners, patients, and developers in designing, implementing, and using AI in a responsible manner that preserves human dignity. The facts encompass a range of ethical concerns that were commonly found in relevant literature. Given that it is crucial to bring as many perspectives as possible to the field, this work contributes to translate principles into human action to guarantee an ethical AI in health.",

        "abstract": "The demands of traditional industrial robotics differ significantly from those of space robotics. While industry requires robots that can perform repetitive tasks with precision and speed, the space environment needs robots to cope with uncertainties, dynamics, and communication delays or interruptions, similar to human astronauts. These demands make a well-suited application for compliant robotics and behavior-based programming. Pose Target Wrench Limiting (PTWL) is a compliant behavior paradigm developed specifically to meet these demands. PTWL controls a robot by moving a virtual attractor to a target pose. The attractor applies virtual forces, based on stiffness and damping presets, to an underlying admittance controller. Guided by virtual forces, the robot will follow the attractor until safety conditions are violated or success criteria are met. We tested PTWL on a variety of quasi-static tasks that may be useful for future space operations. Our results demonstrate that PTWL is an extremely powerful tool. It makes teleoperation easy and safe for a wide range of quasi-static tasks. It also facilitates the creation of semi-autonomous state machines that can reliably complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.",

        "abstract": "As personalization technology increasingly orchestrates individualized shopping or marketing experiences in industries such as logistics, fast-moving consumer goods, and food delivery, these sectors require flexible solutions that can automate object grasping for unknown or unseen objects without much modification or downtime. Most solutions in the market are based on traditional object recognition and are, therefore, not suitable for grasping unknown objects with varying shapes and textures. Adequate learning policies enable robotic grasping to accommodate high-mix and low-volume manufacturing scenarios. In this paper, we review the recent development of learning-based robotic grasping techniques from a corpus of over 150 papers. In addition to addressing the current achievements from researchers all over the world, we also point out the gaps and challenges faced in AI-enabled grasping, which hinder robotization in the aforementioned industries. In addition to 3D object segmentation and learning-based grasping benchmarks, we have also performed a comprehensive market survey regarding tactile sensors and robot skin. Furthermore, we reviewed the latest literature on how sensor feedback can be trained by a learning model to provide valid inputs for grasping stability. Finally, learning-based soft gripping is evaluated as soft grippers can accommodate objects of various sizes and shapes and can even handle fragile objects. In general, robotic grasping can achieve higher flexibility and adaptability, when equipped with learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "A warehouse pickup and delivery problem finds its solution using multi agent path finding (MAPF) approach. Also, the problem has been used to showcase the capabilities of the multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The warehouse pickup and delivery work needs the agent to pick up a requested item and successfully deliver it to the intended location within the warehouse. The problem has been solved based on two approaches that include single shot and lifelong problem solution. The single shot solution has the delivery as the final goal and thus once it reaches the delivery address, it stops whereas in case of lifelong, the agent needs to deliver the item which it had picked, deliver it to the required place and then again pick up new item until requests are satisfied. The strategy used by multi agent path finding (MAPF) approach aims at constructing collision free paths to reach the delivery location but in case of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the agents’ decision making tactics (or policies) are learned which are then used to help agents decide path to be followed based on environment state and agent’s position. The results show that the lifelong conflict based search (CBS) is a better option when the agents are less in number as in that case, the re-planning will take overall less time but when the agents are large in number then this re-planning can take very long to produce conflict free paths from source to goal nodes. In this case, shared experience action critic (SEAC) which is based on multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach can be more efficient choice as it takes the current environment state to give the most suitable action for that time t. For this study the agents taken for learning are homogeneous in nature that can pickup and deliver any type of requested item. We can address the same pickup and delivery problem when the agents are not all same and differ in their capabilities and the type of item they can handle.",

The evolution towards maritime autonomous systems, often providing significant benefits (e.g., cost, physical safety), requires the utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the functions of a conventional crew. However, unsecured AI systems can be plagued with vulnerabilities naturally inherent within complex AI models. The adversarial AI threat, primarily only evaluated in a laboratory environment, increases the likelihood of strategic adversarial exploitation and attacks on mission-critical AI, including maritime autonomous systems. This work evaluates AI threats to maritime autonomous systems in situ. The results show that multiple attacks can be used against real-world maritime autonomous systems with a range of lethality. However, the effects of AI attacks vary in a dynamic and complex environment from that proposed in lower entropy laboratory environments. We propose a set of adversarial test examples and demonstrate their use, specifically in the marine environment. The results of this paper highlight security risks and deliver a set of principles to mitigate threats to AI, throughout the AI lifecycle, in an evolving threat landscape.",

        "abstract": "In the last decades, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) proved to be a fundamental topic in the field of robotics, due to the many applications, ranging from autonomous driving to 3D reconstruction. Many systems have been proposed in literature exploiting a heterogeneous variety of sensors. State-of-the-art methods build their own map from scratch, using only data coming from the equipment of the robot, and not exploiting possible reconstructions of the environment. Moreover, temporary loss of data proves to be a challenge for SLAM systems, as it demands efficient re-localization to continue the localization process. In this paper, we present a SLAM system that exploits additional information coming from mapping services like OpenStreetMaps, hence the name OSM-SLAM, to face these issues. We extend an existing LiDAR-based Graph SLAM system, ART-SLAM, making it able to integrate the 2D geometry of buildings in the trajectory estimation process, by matching a prior OpenStreetMaps map with a single LiDAR scan. Each estimated pose of the robot is then associated with all buildings surrounding it. This association allows to improve localization accuracy, but also to adjust possible mistakes in the prior map. The pose estimates coming from SLAM are then jointly optimized with the constraints associated with the various OSM buildings, which can assume one of the following types: Buildings are always fixed (Prior SLAM); buildings surrounding a robot are movable in chunks, for every scan (Rigid SLAM); and every single building is free to move independently from the others (Non-rigid SLAM). Lastly, OSM maps can also be used to re-localize the robot when sensor data is lost. We compare the accuracy of the proposed system with existing methods for LiDAR-based SLAM, including the baseline, also providing a visual inspection of the results. The comparison is made by evaluating the estimated trajectory displacement using the KITTI odometry dataset. Moreover, the experimental campaign, along with an ablation study on the re-localization capabilities of the proposed system and its accuracy in loop detection-denied scenarios, allow a discussion about how the quality of prior maps influences the SLAM procedure, which may lead to worse estimates than the baseline.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become pervasive in numerous facets of modern life, wielding considerable influence in critical decision-making realms such as healthcare, finance, criminal justice, and beyond. Yet, the inherent opacity of many AI models presents significant hurdles concerning trust, accountability, and fairness. To address these challenges, Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a pivotal area of research, striving to augment the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive exploration of the state-of-the-art in XAI methods and their practical applications. We delve into a spectrum of techniques, spanning from model-agnostic approaches to interpretable machine learning models, meticulously scrutinizing their respective strengths, limitations, and real-world implications. The landscape of XAI is rich and varied, with diverse methodologies tailored to address different facets of interpretability. Model-agnostic approaches offer versatility by providing insights into model behavior across various AI architectures. In contrast, interpretable machine learning models prioritize transparency by design, offering inherent understandability at the expense of some predictive performance. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and attention mechanisms delve into the inner workings of neural networks, shedding light on feature importance and decision processes. Additionally, counterfactual explanations open avenues for exploring what-if scenarios, elucidating the causal relationships between input features and model outcomes. In tandem with methodological exploration, this survey scrutinizes the deployment and impact of XAI across multifarious domains. Successful case studies showcase the practical utility of transparent AI in healthcare diagnostics, financial risk assessment, criminal justice systems, and more. By elucidating these use cases, we illuminate the transformative potential of XAI in enhancing decision-making processes while fostering accountability and fairness. Nevertheless, the journey towards fully transparent AI systems is fraught with challenges and opportunities. As we traverse the current landscape of XAI, we identify pressing areas for further research and development. These include refining interpretability metrics, addressing the scalability of XAI techniques to complex models, and navigating the ethical dimensions of transparency in AI decision-making.Through this survey, we endeavor to cultivate a deeper understanding of transparency in AI decision-making, empowering stakeholders to navigate the intricate interplay between accuracy, interpretability, and ethical considerations. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and inspiring collaborative innovation, we aspire to catalyze future advancements in Explainable AI, ultimately paving the way towards more accountable and trustworthy AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Two manipulator Jacobian matrix estimators for constrained planar snake robots are developed and tested, which enables the implementation of Jacobian-based obstacle-aided locomotion (OAL) control schemes. These schemes use obstacles in the robot’s vicinity to obtain propulsion. The devised estimators infer manipulator Jacobians for constrained planar snake robots in situations where the positions and number of surrounding obstacle constraints might change or are not precisely known. The first proposed estimator is an adaptation of contemporary research in soft robots and builds on convex optimization. The second estimator builds on the unscented Kalman filter. By simulations, we evaluate and compare the two devised algorithms in terms of their statistical performance, execution times, and robustness to measurement noise. We find that both algorithms lead to Jacobian matrix estimates that are similarly useful to predict end-effector movements. However, the unscented filter approach requires significantly lower computing resources and is not poised by convergence issues displayed by the convex optimization-based method. We foresee that the estimators may have use in other fields of research, such as soft robotics and visual servoing. The estimators may also be adapted for use in general non-planar snake robots.",

        "abstract": "We live in a time of unprecedented scientific and human progress while being increasingly aware of its negative impacts on our planet’s health. Aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems have significantly declined putting us on course to a sixth mass extinction event. Nonetheless, the advances made in science, engineering, and technology have given us the opportunity to reverse some of our ecosystem damage and preserve them through conservation efforts around the world. However, current conservation efforts are primarily human led with assistance from conventional robotic systems which limit their scope and effectiveness, along with negatively impacting the surroundings. In this perspective, we present the field of bioinspired robotics to develop versatile agents for future conservation efforts that can operate in the natural environment while minimizing the disturbance/impact to its inhabitants and the environment’s natural state. We provide an operational and environmental framework that should be considered while developing bioinspired robots for conservation. These considerations go beyond addressing the challenges of human-led conservation efforts and leverage the advancements in the field of materials, intelligence, and energy harvesting, to make bioinspired robots move and sense like animals. In doing so, it makes bioinspired robots an attractive, non-invasive, sustainable, and effective conservation tool for exploration, data collection, intervention, and maintenance tasks. Finally, we discuss the development of bioinspired robots in the context of collaboration, practicality, and applicability that would ensure their further development and widespread use to protect and preserve our natural world.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Multi-agent systems are an interdisciplinary research field that describes the concept of multiple decisive individuals interacting with a usually partially observable environment. Given the recent advances in single-agent reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has gained tremendous interest in recent years. Most research studies apply a fully centralized learning scheme to ease the transfer from the single-agent domain to multi-agent systems.Methods: In contrast, we claim that a decentralized learning scheme is preferable for applications in real-world scenarios as this allows deploying a learning algorithm on an individual robot rather than deploying the algorithm to a complete fleet of robots. Therefore, this article outlines a novel actor–critic (AC) approach tailored to cooperative MARL problems in sparsely rewarded domains. Our approach decouples the MARL problem into a set of distributed agents that model the other agents as responsive entities. In particular, we propose using two separate critics per agent to distinguish between the joint task reward and agent-based costs as commonly applied within multi-robot planning. On one hand, the agent-based critic intends to decrease agent-specific costs. On the other hand, each agent intends to optimize the joint team reward based on the joint task critic. As this critic still depends on the joint action of all agents, we outline two suitable behavior models based on Stackelberg games: a game against nature and a dyadic game against each agent. Following these behavior models, our algorithm allows fully decentralized execution and training.Results and Discussion: We evaluate our presented method using the proposed behavior models within a sparsely rewarded simulated multi-agent environment. Although our approach already outperforms the state-of-the-art learners, we conclude this article by outlining possible extensions of our algorithm that future research may build upon.",

In order to comprehensively test or optimize image-based heart rate extraction methods, the dataset should contain a large number of factors such as body motion, lighting conditions, and physiological states. However, collecting high-quality datasets with complete parameters is a huge challenge.Methods: In this paper, we introduce a bionic human model based on a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the human body. By integrating synthetic cardiac signal and body involuntary motion into the 3D model, five well-known traditional and four deep learning iPPG (imaging photoplethysmography) extraction methods are used to test the rendered videos.Results: To compare with different situations in the real world, four common scenarios (stillness, expression/talking, light source changes, and physical activity) are created on each 3D human. The 3D human can be built with any appearance and different skin tones. A high degree of agreement is achieved between the signals extracted from videos with the synthetic human and videos with a real human-the performance advantages and disadvantages of the selected iPPG methods are consistent for both real and 3D humans.Discussion: This technology has the capability to generate synthetic humans within various scenarios, utilizing precisely controlled parameters and disturbances. Furthermore, it holds considerable potential for testing and optimizing image-based vital signs methods in challenging situations where real people with reliable ground truth measurements are difficult to obtain, such as in drone rescue.",

        "abstract": "We present Affordance Recognition with One-Shot Human Stances (AROS), a one-shot learning approach that uses an explicit representation of interactions between highly articulated human poses and 3D scenes. The approach is one-shot since it does not require iterative training or retraining to add new affordance instances. Furthermore, only one or a small handful of examples of the target pose are needed to describe the interactions. Given a 3D mesh of a previously unseen scene, we can predict affordance locations that support the interactions and generate corresponding articulated 3D human bodies around them. We evaluate the performance of our approach on three public datasets of scanned real environments with varied degrees of noise. Through rigorous statistical analysis of crowdsourced evaluations, our results show that our one-shot approach is preferred up to 80% of the time over data-intensive baselines.",

        "abstract": "Underwater infrastructure, such as pipelines, requires regular inspection and maintenance including cleaning, welding of defects and valve-turning or hot-stabbing. At the moment, these tasks are mostly performed by divers and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) but the use of intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (intervention-AUVs) can greatly reduce operation time, risk, and cost. However, autonomous underwater manipulation has not yet reached a high technological readiness and is an intensively researched topic. This review identifies key requirements based on necessary inspection and maintenance methods, linking them to the current technology and deriving major challenges which need to be addressed in development. These include the handling of tools, where a separation between handheld and mounted tools is detected in already employed underwater intervention vehicles such as the Sabertooth by Saab Seaeye or the Aquanaut by Nauticus robotics, two vehicles capable of semi-autonomous intervention. The main challenge identified concerns high level autonomy, i.e., the process of decision-making. This process includes detecting the correct point of interest, maximizing the workspace of the manipulator, planning the manipulation considering required forces, and monitoring the progress to allow for corrections and high quality results. In order to overcome these issues, reliable close range sensing and precise end point navigation is needed. By identifying these persisting challenges, the paper provides inspiration for further development directions in the field of autonomous underwater intervention.",

        "abstract": "Combining and completing point cloud data from two or more sensors with arbitrarily relative perspectives in a dynamic, cluttered, and complex environment is challenging, especially when the two sensors have significant perspective differences while the large overlap ratio and feature-rich scene cannot be guaranteed. We create a novel approach targeting this challenging scenario by registering two camera captures in a time series with unknown perspectives and human movements to easily use our system in a real-life scene. In our approach, we first reduce the six unknowns of 3D point cloud completion to three by aligning the ground planes found by our previous perspective-independent 3D ground plane estimation algorithm. Subsequently, we use a histogram-based approach to identify and extract all the humans from each frame generating a three-dimensional (3D) human walking sequence in a time series. To enhance accuracy and performance, we convert 3D human walking sequences to lines by calculating the center of mass (CoM) point of each human body and connecting them. Finally, we match the walking paths in different data trials by minimizing the Fréchet distance between two walking paths and using 2D iterative closest point (ICP) to find the remaining three unknowns in the overall transformation matrix for the final alignment. Using this approach, we can successfully register the corresponding walking path of the human between the two cameras’ captures and estimate the transformation matrix between the two sensors.",

        "abstract": "The incessant progress of robotic technology and rationalization of human manpower induces high expectations in society, but also resentment and even fear. In this paper, we present a quantitative normalized comparison of performance, to shine a light onto the pressing question, “How close is the current state of humanoid robotics to outperforming humans in their typical functions (e.g., locomotion, manipulation), and their underlying structures (e.g., actuators/muscles) in human-centered domains?” This is the most comprehensive comparison of the literature so far. Most state-of-the-art robotic structures required for visual, tactile, or vestibular perception outperform human structures at the cost of slightly higher mass and volume. Electromagnetic and fluidic actuation outperform human muscles w.r.t. speed, endurance, force density, and power density, excluding components for energy storage and conversion. Artificial joints and links can compete with the human skeleton. In contrast, the comparison of locomotion functions shows that robots are trailing behind in energy efficiency, operational time, and transportation costs. Robots are capable of obstacle negotiation, object manipulation, swimming, playing soccer, or vehicle operation. Despite the impressive advances of humanoid robots in the last two decades, current robots are not yet reaching the dexterity and versatility to cope with more complex manipulation and locomotion tasks (e.g., in confined spaces). We conclude that state-of-the-art humanoid robotics is far from matching the dexterity and versatility of human beings. Despite the outperforming technical structures, robot functions are inferior to human ones, even with tethered robots that could place heavy auxiliary components off-board. The persistent advances in robotics let us anticipate the diminishing of the gap.",

        "abstract": "The Delta robot is a parallel robot that is over-actuated and has a highly nonlinear dynamic model, which poses a significant challenge to its control design. The inverse kinematics that maps the motor angles to the position of the end effector is highly nonlinear and extremely important for the control design of the Delta robot. It has been experimentally shown that geometry-based inverse kinematics is not accurate enough to capture the dynamics of the Delta robot due to manufacturing component errors, measurement errors, joint flexibility, backlash, friction, etc. To address this issue, we propose a neural network model to approximate the inverse kinematics of the Delta robot with stepper motors. The neural network model is trained with randomly sampled experimental data and implemented on the hardware in an open-loop control for trajectory tracking. Extensive experimental results show that the neural network model achieves excellent performance in terms of the trajectory tracking of the Delta robot under different operation conditions, and outperforms the geometry-based inverse kinematics model. A critical numerical observation indicates that neural networks trained with the specific trajectory data fall short of anticipated performance due to a lack of data. Conversely, neural networks trained on random experimental data capture the rich dynamics of the Delta robot and are quite robust to model uncertainties compared to geometry-based inverse kinematics.",

External sensors are often used to remove or detect it, which transforms the process into a cumbersome data set-up. Thus, we decided to only use GNSS correlator outputs to detect a large-amplitude multipath, on Galileo E1-B and GPS L1 C/A, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). This network was trained using 101 correlator outputs being used as a theoretical classifier. To take advantage of the strengths of convolutional neural networks for image detection, images representing the correlator output values as a function of delay and time were generated. The presented model has an F score of 94.7% on Galileo E1-B and 91.6% on GPS L1 C/A. To reduce the computational load, the number of correlator outputs and correlator sampling frequency was then decreased by a factor of 4, and the convolutional neural network still has an F score of 91.8% on Galileo E1-B and 90.5% on GPS L1 C/A.",

        "abstract": "Robots have tremendous potential, and have recently been introduced not only for simple operations in factories, but also in workplaces where customer service communication is required. However, communication robots have not always been accepted. This study proposes a three-stage (first contact, interaction, and decision) model for robot acceptance based on the human cognitive process flow to design preferred robots and clarifies the elements of the robot and the processes that affect robot acceptance decision-making. Unlike previous robot acceptance models, the current model focuses on a sequential account of how people decide to accept, considering the interaction (or carry-over) effect between impressions established at each stage. According to the model, this study conducted a scenario-based experiment focusing on the impression of the first contact (a robot’s appearance) and that formed during the interaction with robot (politeness of its conversation and behavior) on robot acceptance in both successful and slightly failed situations. The better the appearance of the robot and the more polite its behavior, the greater the acceptance rate. Importantly, there was no interaction between these two factors. The results indicating that the impressions of the first contact and interaction are additively processed suggest that we should accumulate findings that improving the appearance of the robot and making its communication behavior more human-like in politeness will lead to a more acceptable robot design.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have revolutionized the way health organizations approach social media. The sheer volume of data generated through social media can be overwhelming, but AI and ML can help organizations effectively manage this information to improve telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the well-being of individuals and communities. Previous research has revealed several trends in AI–ML adoption: First, AI can be used to enhance social media marketing. Drawing on sentiment analysis and related tools, social media is an effective way to increase brand awareness and customer engagement. Second, social media can become a very useful data collection tool when integrated with new AI–ML technologies. Using this function well requires researchers and practitioners to protect users’ privacy carefully, such as through the deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Third, AI–ML enables organizations to maintain a long-term relationship with stakeholders. Chatbots and related tools can increase users’ ability to receive personalized content. The review in this paper identifies research gaps in the literature. In view of these gaps, the paper proposes a conceptual framework that highlights essential components for better utilizing AI and ML. Additionally, it enables researchers and practitioners to better design social media platforms that minimize the spread of misinformation and address ethical concerns more readily. It also provides insights into the adoption of AI and ML in the context of remote patient monitoring and telehealth within social media platforms.",

However, the challenge of preserving their flexibility during deployment has necessitated using soft sensors which can enhance their mobility, energy efficiency, and spatial adaptability. Through emulating the structure, strategies, and working principles of human senses, soft robots can detect stimuli without direct contact with soft touchless sensors and tactile stimuli. This has resulted in noteworthy progress within the field of soft robotics. Nevertheless, soft, touchless sensors offer the advantage of non-invasive sensing and gripping without the drawbacks linked to physical contact. Consequently, the popularity of soft touchless sensors has grown in recent years, as they facilitate intuitive and safe interactions with humans, other robots, and the surrounding environment. This review explores the emerging confluence of touchless sensing and soft robotics, outlining a roadmap for deployable soft robots to achieve human-level dexterity.",

The closed-loop transfer function of the CUK converter has been developed by the State Space Average (SSA) technique. This paper assesses both the cases of converter stability when it is integrated with the conventional PID controller and the BIA-PID controllers (FA-PID, PSO-PID, ABC-PID) and eventually compares the outcomes from all the controllers. For examining the stability of the system, three objective functions (IAE, ITAE, and ISE) and various performance specifications such as percentage of overshoot, rise time, settling time, and peak amplitude are tabulated. MATLAB and Simulink are used to carry out the simulations meticulously. Hence, a comparative analysis is illustrated in this paper to state a clear-sighted evaluation of the performances.",

Telerobotics presents an avenue for semi-autonomous robotic disassembly that addresses these challenges. However, it is suggested that quality and realism of the user’s haptic interactions with the environment is important for precise, contact-rich and safety-critical tasks. To investigate this proposition, we demonstrate the disassembly of a Nissan Leaf 2011 module stack as a basis for a comparative study between a traditional asymmetric haptic-“cobot” master-slave framework and identical master and slave cobots based on task completion time and success rate metrics. We demonstrate across a range of disassembly tasks a time reduction of 22%–57% is achieved using identical cobots, yet this improvement arises chiefly from an expanded workspace and 1:1 positional mapping, and suffers a 10%–30% reduction in first attempt success rate. For unbolting and grasping, the realism of force feedback was comparatively less important than directional information encoded in the interaction, however, 1:1 force mapping strengthened environmental tactile cues for vacuum pick-and-place and contact cutting tasks.",

        "abstract": "Successful conversational interaction with a social robot requires not only an assessment of a user’s contribution to an interaction, but also awareness of their emotional and attitudinal states as the interaction unfolds. To this end, our research aims to systematically trigger, but then interpret human behaviors to track different states of potential user confusion in interaction so that systems can be primed to adjust their policies in light of users entering confusion states. In this paper, we present a detailed human-robot interaction study to prompt, investigate, and eventually detect confusion states in users. The study itself employs a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) style design with a Pepper robot to prompt confusion states for task-oriented dialogues in a well-defined manner. The data collected from 81 participants includes audio and visual data, from both the robot’s perspective and the environment, as well as participant survey data. From these data, we evaluated the correlations of induced confusion conditions with multimodal data, including eye gaze estimation, head pose estimation, facial emotion detection, silence duration time, and user speech analysis—including emotion and pitch analysis. Analysis shows significant differences of participants’ behaviors in states of confusion based on these signals, as well as a strong correlation between confusion conditions and participants own self-reported confusion scores. The paper establishes strong correlations between confusion levels and these observable features, and lays the ground or a more complete social and affect oriented strategy for task-oriented human-robot interaction.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Utilizing anthropomorphic features in industrial robots is a prevalent strategy aimed at enhancing their perception as collaborative team partners and promoting increased tolerance for failures. Nevertheless, recent research highlights the presence of potential drawbacks associated with this approach. It is still widely unknown, how anthropomorphic framing influences the dynamics of trust especially, in context of different failure experiences.Method: The current laboratory study wanted to close this research gap. To do so, fifty-one participants interacted with a robot that was either anthropomorphically or technically framed. In addition, each robot produced either a comprehensible or an incomprehensible failure.Results: The analysis revealed no differences in general trust towards the technically and anthropomorphically framed robot. Nevertheless, the anthropomorphic robot was perceived as more transparent than the technical robot. Furthermore, the robot’s purpose was perceived as more positive after experiencing a comprehensible failure.Discussion: The perceived higher transparency of anthropomorphically framed robots might be a double-edged sword, as the actual transparency did not differ between both conditions. In general, the results show that it is essential to consider trust multi-dimensionally, as a uni-dimensional approach which is often focused on performance might overshadow important facets of trust like transparency and purpose.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous multi-agent systems can be deployed to complete a variety of tasks, including some that are impossible using a single generic modality. This paper introduces an approach to solving the problem of cooperative behavior planning in small heterogeneous robot teams where members can both function independently as well as physically interact with each other in ways that give rise to additional functionality. This approach enables, for the first time, the cooperative completion of tasks that are infeasible when using any single modality from those agents comprising the team.",
