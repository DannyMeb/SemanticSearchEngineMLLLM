        "abstract": "Deep learning is a more situational and reflective way of learning that integrates complex knowledge and skills into intuitive thinking. As a language that closely combines sound, form and meaning, Chinese teaching and learning from the perspective of deep learning can help break through the limitations of the current teaching model that only focuses on certain language knowledge or cultural behaviors. This paper combines deep learning with international Chinese education, creates deep Chinese teaching and learning model including “four stages and ten steps”, and carries out practical application and teaching effect test. The results show that the deep Chinese teaching and learning model is conducive to improving students’ discourse presentation ability and comprehensive skills, cultivating the learners’ autonomous learning ability and intercultural communication competence, and strengthening the integration of language teaching and cultural teaching. At the same time, this model also has some limitations, need to be further adjusted and optimized.",

To validate the diagnosis results, various clinical parameters must be defined. In this context, several algorithms and mathematical tools have been developed in the last two decades to extract accurate information from medical images or signals. Traditionally, the extraction of features using image processing from medical data are time-consuming which requires human interaction and expert validation. The segmentation of medical images, the classification of medical images, and the significance of deep learning-based algorithms in disease detection are all topics covered in this chapter.",

        "abstract": "Informal learning is a universal current phenomenon of learning via participation, experience, or learning via student-centered knowledge creation. It stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of didactic teacher-centered learning. Online education can be regarded as a positive and self-directed form of informal learning. Whether or not deep learning takes place for the online learner is a controversial topic for many educators. This chapter will discuss the benefits and challenges of the relationship between informal online learning leading to deeper learning. But, what isn't controversial is that in this century more education has been delivered in digital platforms than in any other time in history. For most providers of education to remain highly competitive, they must engage in electronic education of some form by moving beyond the brick and mortar of the traditional classroom. Informal learning has become the impetus resulting in the extensive and intensive application of electronic education. ",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there's been a resurgence in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is gaining a lot of attention. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that can be used to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers with complex structures, or otherwise composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Estimation of depth in a Neural Network (NN) or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an integral as well as complicated process. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. This chapter describes the motivations for deep architecture, problem with large networks, the need for deep architecture and new implementation techniques for deep learning. At the end, there is also an algorithm to implement the deep architecture using the recursive nature of functions and transforming them to get the desired output. ",

Article presents reinforcement learning (RL) as a tool for the manager on the path to learning winning behavior in the complex environment of organization management. Organization management has wicked learning challenges because agents are under biases that prevent understanding the phenomenon of delayed reward. Therefore, the digital simulation with RL is effective forming breakthrough learning results. Human capital management theories provide architecture in creating organization digital twin where agent can practice management actions effect on business economics and staff wellbeing. Utilizing RL algorithms, it is possible to foster behavior for creating sustainable competitive advantage – this means the Nash equilibrium between profit and staff wellbeing. In this digital twin there is AI learning assistant as a teacher that provides demonstrations on how to act so that the delayed reward is good in the future. The article explains game theoretical approach that is the foundation for creating management deep learning AI system. Human agent at the organization is playing the game of Strategic Stochastic Bayesian Nonsymmetric Signaling game in co-operative or non-cooperative way and at zero-sum or general sum game mind-set.",

Furthermore, risk-based security, as a means of improving travelers’ experience at check points is expected to reduce queueing and waiting times while improving at the same travelers’ experience during checks. A number of projects have been funded by the European Commission to investigate the concept of risk-based security and develop the means and technology required to implement it. The author is the Coordinator of two of the flagship projects funded by EC on risk-based security: FLYSEC and TRESSPASS. This chapter discusses and analyses the concept of risk-based security, the inherent competing mechanism between risk assessment, screening time and level of security, and means to implement risk-based security based on anomaly detection using deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) methods.",

More recently, deep learning has been widely used in optimising the performance of nanophotonic devices, where the conventional computational approach may require much computation time and significant computation source. In this chapter, we briefly review the recent progress of deep learning in nanophotonics. We overview the applications of the deep learning approach to optimising the various nanophotonic devices. It includes multilayer structures, plasmonic/dielectric metasurfaces and plasmonic chiral metamaterials. Also, nanophotonic can directly serve as an ideal platform to mimic optical neural networks based on nonlinear optical media, which in turn help to achieve high-performance photonic chips that may not be realised based on conventional design method.",

        "abstract": "The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). During the training of RNN architecture, sequential information is used and travels through the neural network from input vector to the output neurons, while the error is calculated and propagated back through the network to update the network parameters. Information in these networks incorporates loops into the hidden layer. Loops allow information to flow multi-directionally so that the hidden state signifies past information held at a given time step. Consequently, the output is dependent on the previous predictions which are already known. However, RNNs have limited capacity to bridge more than a certain number of steps. Mainly this is due to the vanishing of gradients which causes the predictions to capture the short-term dependencies as information from earlier steps decays. As more layers in RNN containing activation functions are added, the gradient of the loss function approaches zero. The LSTM neural networks (LSTM-ANNs) enable learning long-term dependencies. LSTM introduces a memory unit and gate mechanism to enable capture of the long dependencies in a sequence. Therefore, LSTM networks can selectively remember or forget information and are capable of learn thousands timesteps by structures called cell states and three gates.",

As a solution, the author proposes an exponential, pre-spatial arithmetic scheme (“all-powerful scheme”) by computational information conservation theory (CICT) to overcome the Information Double-Bind (IDB) problem and to thrive on both deterministic noise (DN) and random noise (RN) to develop powerful cognitive computational framework for deep learning, towards deep thinking applications. In a previous paper the author showed and discussed how this new CICT framework can help us to develop even competitive advanced quantum cognitive computational systems. An operative example is presented. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to develop deeper learning and deep thinking system and application at your fingertips and beyond.

        "abstract": "“Deep learning” uses Post-Selection—selection of a model after training multiple models using data. The performance data of “Seep Learning” have been deceptively inflated due to two misconducts: 1: cheating in the absence of a test; 2: hiding bad-looking data. Through the same misconducts, a simple method Pure-Guess Nearest Neighbor (PGNN) gives no errors on any validation dataset V, as long as V is in the possession of the authors and both the amount of storage space and the time of training are finite but unbounded. The misconducts are fatal, because “Deep Learning” is not generalizable, by overfitting a sample set V. The charges here are applicable to all learning modes. This chapter proposes new AI metrics, called developmental errors for all networks trained, under four Learning Conditions: (1) a body including sensors and effectors, (2) an incremental learning architecture (due to the “big data” flaw), (3) a training experience, and (4) a limited amount of computational resources. Developmental Networks avoid Deep Learning misconduct because they train a sole system, which automatically discovers context rules on the fly by generating emergent Turing machines that are optimal in the sense of maximum likelihood across a lifetime, conditioned on the four Learning Conditions.",

Access to vast amounts of data extensive computational power and a new wave of efficient learning algorithms, helped Artificial Neural Networks to achieve state-of-the-art results in almost all AI challenges. DL is the cornerstone technology behind products for image recognition and video annotation, voice recognition, personal assistants, automated translation and autonomous vehicles. DL works similarly to the brain by extracting high-level, complex abstractions from data in a hierarchical and discriminative or generative way. The implications of DL supported AI in business is tremendous, shaking to the foundations many industries. In this chapter, I present the most significant algorithms and applications, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), image and video processing and finance. ",

        "abstract": "The subject of deep learning has emerged in the last decade as one of the most promising approaches to machine learning. Today, certainly, much of the recent progress in artificial intelligence is due to it, but research challenges are still unresolved and remain open to the research community. This paper attempts to offer a comprehensive review of deep learning progress in active research frontiers. On the one side, by presenting a brief overview of deep learning success, we inspire researchers to work in deep learning. On the other hand, we examine a range of technical issues, and open research issues that we believe are relevant topics for exploratory research. As deep learning applies to various fields, we restrict this paper’s scope to visual recognition tasks to analyze these problems with a specific lens. However, these problems will be broadly applicable to other fields. It will make it easier for new researchers to recognize outstanding research problems in the deep learning domain.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning is a technique of parsing data, learning from that data, and then applying what has been learned to make informed decisions. Deep learning is actually a subset of machine learning. It technically is machine learning and functions in the same way, but it has different capabilities. The main difference between deep and machine learning is, machine learning models become well progressively, but the model still needs some guidance. If a machine learning model returns an inaccurate prediction, then the programmer needs to fix that problem explicitly, but in the case of deep learning, the model does it by itself. Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning. On other hand, Artificial Intelligence is a different thing from machine learning and deep learning. Deep learning and machine learning both are the subsets of AI. ",

        "abstract": "This chapter introduces a dynamic and low-complexity decision-making algorithm which aims at time-average utility maximization in real-time deep learning platforms, inspired by Lyapunov optimization. In deep learning computation, large delays can happen due to the fact that it is computationally expensive. Thus, handling the delays is an important issue for the commercialization of deep learning algorithms. In this chapter, the proposed algorithm observes system delays at first formulated by queue-backlog, and then it dynamically conducts sequential decision-making under the tradeoff between utility (i.e., deep learning performance) and system delays. In order to evaluate the proposed decision-making algorithm, the performance evaluation results with real-world data are presented under the applications of super-resolution frameworks. Lastly, this chapter summarizes that the Lyapunov optimization algorithm can be used in various emerging applications.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there's been a resurgence in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is gaining a lot of attention. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that can be used to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers with complex structures, or otherwise composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Estimation of depth in a Neural Network (NN) or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an integral as well as complicated process. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. This chapter describes the motivations for deep architecture, problem with large networks, the need for deep architecture and new implementation techniques for deep learning. At the end, there is also an algorithm to implement the deep architecture using the recursive nature of functions and transforming them to get the desired output. ",

        "abstract": "Skin lesion analysis is a tedious and challenging task, thus, in this research the suitability of employing machine learning or deep learning approaches for automatic lesion segmentation on dermoscopic skin cancer images is determined. The segmented region can assist clinical experts in understanding the complex lesion structure and internal pattern to find the correct skin cancer type for its early diagnosis and prevention. In this study, I present two methodologies for performing lesion segmentation: machine learning-based optimized K-means with Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the first model, the FA is hybridized with K-means clustering based on the novel average intensity fitness function to optimize the segmentation map. It is observed in the experimental results that the K-means algorithm may lead to poor results due to the wrong selection of initial centroid value, thus FA is hybridized into it to improve the performance. The second model is an enhanced encoder-decoder-based CNN framework implemented in an end-to-end fashion. These two models are compared to understand whether machine learning or deep learning is suitable to perform medical image segmentation based on a few performance metrics such as accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and DICE index. These methods are evaluated and compared on two benchmark datasets provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) named ISIC 2016 [1] and ISIC 2017 [2]. Experimental results showed that the CNN model outperformed the machine learning model with an accuracy difference of 7.98% on ISIC 2016, and 7.32% on ISIC 2017. I concluded from the experimental findings that the deep learning model is more accurate and efficient in segmenting the lesion area as compared to the machine learning model. Thus, findings from this experimental work will be considered for the design of an automatic classification system by incorporating a deep learning-based segmentation approach as a pre-processing step. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep neural networks (DNN) models have the potential to provide new insights in the study of human decision making, due to their high capacity and data-driven design. While these models may be able to go beyond theory-driven models in predicting human behaviour, their opaque nature limits their ability to explain how an operation is carried out. This explainability problem remains unresolved. Here we demonstrate the use of a DNN model as an exploratory tool to identify predictable and consistent human behaviour in value-based decision making beyond the scope of theory-driven models. We then propose using theory-driven models to characterise the operation of the DNN model. We trained a DNN model to predict human decisions in a four-armed bandit task. We found that this model was more accurate than a reinforcement-learning reward-oriented model geared towards choosing the most rewarding option. This disparity in accuracy was more pronounced during times when the expected reward from all options was similar, i.e., no unambiguous good option. To investigate this disparity, we introduced a reward-oblivious model, which was trained to predict human decisions without information about the rewards obtained from each option. This model captured decision-sequence patterns made by participants (e.g., a-b-c-d). In a series of experimental offline simulations of all models we found that the general model was in line with a reward-oriented model’s predictions when one option was clearly better than the others.However, when options’ expected rewards were similar to each other, it was in-line with the reward-oblivious model’s pattern completion predictions. These results indicate the contribution of predictable but task-irrelevant decision patterns to human decisions, especially when task-relevant choices are not immediately apparent. Importantly, we demonstrate how theory-driven cognitive models can be used to characterise the operation of DNNs, making them a useful explanatory tool in scientific investigation.Author SummaryDeep neural networks (DNN) models are an extremely useful tool across multiple domains, and specifically for performing tasks that mimic and predict human behaviour. However, due to their opaque nature and high level of complexity, their ability to explain human behaviour is limited. Here we used DNN models to uncover hitherto overlooked aspects of human decision making, i.e., their reliance on predictable patterns for exploration. For this purpose, we trained a DNN model to predict human choices in a decision-making task. We then characterised this data-driven model using explicit, theory-driven cognitive models, in a set of offline experimental simulations. This relationship between explicit and data-driven approaches, where high-capacity models are used to explore beyond the scope of established models and theory-driven models are used to explain and characterise these new grounds, make DNN models a powerful scientific tool.",

        "abstract": "With the constantly growing number of topical or sentiment-bearing texts and dialogs on the Web, the demand for automatic language or text analysis algorithms continues to expand. This chapter discusses about advanced deep learning techniques for classical and hot research directions in the field of natural language processing, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and task-oriented dialog systems. In text classification, we focus on tasks of multi-label text classification and extreme multi-label text classification, which allow for automatically annotates the texts with the most relevant labels. In sentiment analysis, we look into aspect-based sentiment analysis that makes automatic extraction of fine-grained sentiment information from texts, and multimodal sentiment analysis that classifies people’s opinions or attitudes from multimedia data through fusion techniques. In dialog system, we introduce how deep learning techniques work in pipeline mode and end-to-end mode for task-oriented dialog system. In this chapter, the rapidly evolving state of the research on the three topics is reviewed. Furthermore, trends in the research on deep learning for natural language processing are identified, and a discussion about future advances is provided.",

        "abstract": "Medical image processing has a significant role in clinical investigation and\nrecent medical research. An appropriate image-based medical assessment helps to\nanalyze or detect critical diseases early, as it has a high value of medical information.\nIn this study, medical imaging is reviewed for the diagnosis of eye diseases using\ncomputational intelligence. However, the identification of these diseases using\ntraditional image processing is quite complicated. Nowadays, various machine learning\nand deep learning approaches are developed for the detection of different eye diseases\nwhich are helpful for the detection of the diseases at an early stage. Research showed\nthat eye disorders are more serious in emerging or underdeveloped nations due to\ninadequate healthcare facilities and skilled health workers. An estimate of 45 million\npeople around the world are blind and the tragic fact is that only 75% of these cases are\ncurable. Moreover, the doctor-patient ratio around the globe is about 1: 10,000.\nTherefore, it takes an hour to create a screening system for the identification of these\nillnesses. Ophthalmology is close to making breakthroughs in evaluating, diagnosing,\nand treating eye diseases. Additionally, many eye and vision problems show no\nobvious signs. As a consequence, people are often unaware that problems exist. Early\ndetection of diseases is a primary concern as they could be easily cured before leading\nto severity. This research paper focuses on detecting eye illnesses, such as Diabetic\nretinopathy, Diabetic Macular Edema, Glaucoma, Age macular Degeneration, Retinal\nVascular Occlusions, and Retinal Detachment. The authors explore various algorithms,\nimaging modalities, and challenges in this context. The study aims to raise awareness\nabout eye disorders leading to blindness using computer vision, image processing, and\ndeep learning techniques. It also investigates how these machine learning and deep\nlearning approaches can aid in early disease diagnoses for effective treatment before\nvision loss occurs.",

In particular, users will figure out how to perform fundamental calculations in TensorFlow and implementation of deep learning using TensorFlow. This chapter intends to gives a straightforward manual for the complexities of Google's TensorFlow framework that is easy to understand. The basic steps for the installation and setup of TensorFlow will also be discussed. Starting with a simple “Hello World” example, a practical implementation of deep learning problem to identify the handwritten digits will be discussed using MNIST dataset. It is only possible to understand deep learning through substantial practical examples. For that reason, the authors have included practical implementation of deep learning problems that motivates the readers to plunge deeply into these examples and to get their hands grimy trying different things with their own ideas using TensorFlow because it is never adequate to perceive algorithms only theoretically.

However, we may not know how each feature in these models contributes towards the prediction. In contrast, Rule Induction algorithms provide an interpretable way to extract patterns from data, but traditional approaches suffer in terms of scalability. In this work, we bridge Deep Learning and Rule Induction and define the RIDDLE (Rule Induction with Deep Learning) architecture. We show that RIDDLE has state-of-the-art performance in Rule Induction via an empirical evaluation.",

This chapter will give you a broad overview of the term deep learning, in context to deep learning machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also introduced. In Introduction, there is a brief overview of the research achievements of deep learning. After Introduction, a brief history of deep learning has been also discussed. The history started from a famous scientist called Allen Turing (1951) to 2020. In the start of a chapter after Introduction, there are some commonly used terminologies, which are used in deep learning. The main focus is on the most recent applications, the most commonly used algorithms, modern platforms, and relevant open-source databases or datasets available online. While discussing the most recent applications and platforms of deep learning, their scope in future is also discussed. Future research directions are discussed in applications and platforms. The natural language processing and auto-pilot vehicles were considered the state-of-the-art application, and these applications still need a good portion of further research. Any reader from undergraduate and postgraduate students, data scientist, and researchers would be benefitted from this.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been facilitating privacy-preserving deep learning in many walks of life such as medical image classification, network intrusion detection, and so forth. Whereas it necessitates a central parameter server for model aggregation, which brings about delayed model communication and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. A fully decentralized architecture like Swarm Learning allows peer-to-peer communication among distributed nodes, without the central server. One of the most challenging issues in decentralized deep learning is that data owned by each node are usually non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), causing time-consuming convergence of model training. To this end, we propose a decentralized learning model called Homogeneous Learning (HL) for tackling non-IID data with a self-attention mechanism. In HL, training performs on each round’s selected node, and the trained model of a node is sent to the next selected node at the end of each round. Notably, for the selection, the self-attention mechanism leverages reinforcement learning to observe a node’s inner state and its surrounding environment’s state, and find out which node should be selected to optimize the training. We evaluate our method with various scenarios for two different image classification tasks. The result suggests that HL can achieve a better performance compared with standalone learning and greatly reduce both the total training rounds by 50.8% and the communication cost by 74.6% for decentralized learning with non-IID data.",

This chapter elaborates on general reasons for the popularity of computational techniques such as deep learning and machine learning (ML) applications in the medical image processing domain. The initial part of this chapter focuses on reviewing the fundamental concepts of DL algorithms, competence with machine learning, need in healthcare, applications, and challenges in medical image processing. Doing so allows understanding the reasons for the construction of all of them and offers a different view on various domains in the medical sector. The tools and technology required for DL, selection, implementation, optimization, and testing are discussed with respect to an application of cancer detection. Thus, this chapter gives an overall vision of deep learning concepts related to biomedical research. ",

        "abstract": "This chapter deals with the application of deep learning methods in sports scenes for the purpose of detecting and tracking the athletes and recognizing their activities. The scenes recorded during handball games and training activities will be used as an example. Handball is a team sport played with the ball with well-defined goals and rules, with a given number of players who can participate in the game as well as their roles. Athletes move quickly throughout the field during the game, change position and roles from defensive to offensive, use different techniques and actions, and very often are partially or completely occluded by another athlete. If artificial lighting and cluttered background are additionally taken into account, it is clear that these are very challenging tasks for object detectors and trackers. The chapter will present the results of various experiments that include player and ball detection using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks such as YOLO v3 or Mask R-CNN, player tracking using Deep Sort, key player determination using activity measures, and action recognition using LSTM. In the conclusion, open issues and challenges in applying deep learning methods in such a dynamic sports environment will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia in India and it is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Currently it is diagnosed by calculating the MSME score and by manual study of MRI scan. In this chapter, the authors develop and compare different methods to diagnose and predict Alzheimer's disease by processing structural magnetic resonance image scans (MRI scans) with deep learning neural networks. The authors implement one model of deep-learning networks which are convolution neural network (CNN). They use four different architectures of CNN, namely Lenet-5, AlexNet, ZFNet, and R-CNN architecture. The best accuracies for 75-25 cross validation and 90-10 cross validation are 97.68% and 98.75%, respectively, and achieved by ZFNet architecture of convolution neural network. This research will help in further studies on improving the accuracy of Alzheimer's diagnosis and prediction using neural networks. ",

However, a boom in the use of imaging\ntechniques such as CT scans and chest radiographs has been observed for correct\ndiagnosis. But, manual scanning of these modalities requires expertise in modality\nreading. It is also a time-consuming task. Artificial intelligence-based techniques have\nproven their potential in pattern recognition, object identification, and data analysis.\nTherefore, these techniques can be used to provide assisting tools for the primary\nscreening of diseases from these modalities. It has been observed from the literature\nthat a lot of research works are available on disease diagnosis and classification using\nmachine learning, and deep learning. But, the disease severity detection is\nunderexplored. Moreover, the techniques employed for the detection of the severity of\ndiseases have lacunae that need immediate attention. These challenges motivated us to\nreview the machine learning and deep learning-based technological solutions proposed\nin the literature for the detection of disease severity. The objective of this research is to\npresent a comprehensive survey of research works available about disease severity\ndetection. This research also presents a comparative analysis of the machine learning\ntechniques and deep learning techniques employed, datasets used, and performance\nachieved. It also highlights the drawbacks of the technological solution proposed.\nFurther, it provides the directions for future scope in the domain of disease severity\ndetection.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable results across various tasks. However, recent studies highlight the susceptibility of DRL to targeted adversarial disruptions. Furthermore, discrepancies between simulated settings and real-world applications often make it challenging to transfer these DRL policies, particularly in situations where safety is essential. Several solutions have been proposed to address these issues to enhance DRL's robustness. This chapter delves into the significance of adversarial attack and defense strategies in machine learning, emphasizing the unique challenges in adversarial DRL settings. It also presents an overview of recent advancements, DRL foundations, adversarial Markov decision process models, and comparisons among different attacks and defenses. The chapter further evaluates the effectiveness of various attacks and the efficacy of multiple defense mechanisms using simulation data, specifically focusing on policy success rates and average rewards. Potential limitations and prospects for future research are also explored.",

        "abstract": "Straight Forward Constructive Deep Learning Neural Network (SFC-DLNN) algorithm is a new architecturebased algorithm for artificial neural networks. Rather than simply adjusting the weights in a fixed topology network, SFC-DLNN starts with a minimal topology (perceptron), then builds up their network by gradually trains and adds new nodes one by one, creating multiple layers’ network. Once a unit has been added to the network, the weights of the new architecture are generated. This unit then stands as a permanent detector of features in the network, and a more complex feature space is then created where the data is likely to be linearly separable. The SFC-DLNN algorithm has many advantages over existing ones: it has good learning speed, the network determines its topology size, and the structures it has built is retained after the training stage. We obtain from our built model (SFC-DLNN) an accuracy and specificity of 83:5% from a simulated data set using the uniform distribution. This is not the best but is enough to approve the model prediction capacity",

Big data refers to datasets that are not only big, but also high in variety and velocity, which makes them difficult to handle using traditional tools and techniques. Due to the rapid growth of such data, solutions need to be studiedand provided in order to handle and extract value and knowledge from these datasets. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Such minimal human intervention can be provided using big data analytics, which is the application of advanced analytics techniques on big data. This paper aims to analyse some of the different machine learning algorithms and methods which can be applied to big data analysis, as well as the opportunities provided by the application of big data analytics in various decision making domains.",

        "abstract": "Conversational AI has seen unprecedented growth in recent years due to which Chatbots have been made available. Conversational AI primarily focuses on text or speech inputs, identifying the intention behind them, and responding to users with relevant information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Machine Learning (ML), and speech recognition offer a personalized experience that mimics human-like engagement in conversational AI systems. Conversational AI systems like Google Meena, Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook’s BlenderBot, and OpenAI’s GPT-3 are trained using Deep Learning (DL) techniques that mimic a human brain-like structure and are trained on huge amounts of text data to provide open-domain conversations. The aim of this chapter is to highlight Conversational AI and NLP techniques behind it. The chapter focuses on DL architectures useful in building Conversational AI systems. The chapter discusses what are the recent advances in Conversational AI and how they are useful, what are the challenges, and what is the scope and future of conversational AI. This will help researchers to understand state-of-the-art frameworks and how they are useful in building Conversational AI models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a great Chinese thinker and writer in the 20th century, Lu Xun and his literary works are widely known. However, as a successful cultural communication activist, editor and publisher, we still need to conduct in-depth research on Lu Xun in many aspects. Therefore, based on deep learning, this paper constructs an online multimedia learning system of Lu Xun Literature. This system takes the relationship between classical Lu Xun Literature and modern multimedia technology as the research object,and compare the calculation effect of other different types of algorithms and this dhraa algorithm. Through the availability of data, the dhraa algorithm is significantly better than other algorithms in the recommendation accuracy, thus proving its effectiveness.This system is managed by two servers and one system. The two servers are database server and web server respectively. After testing, the system has good bearing capacity, can make up for the limited processing capacity of the server, and ensure the system has high performance. Its performance characteristics also show that the system achieved the expected performance. This paper systematically combines Lu Xun's literature with modern multimedia, which can provide online learning services for Lu Xun's literature lovers, thus helping scholars to expand Lu Xun's research field and academic vision. This paper designs an effective online learning system of Lu Xun's literature by combining deep learning, multimedia technology and Lu Xun's literature.",

        "abstract": "Modern microprocessors such as CPU, GPU, and the recent deep learning accelerators exhibit significant runtime timing variation, i.e. dynamic timing slack due to the diverse instructions and programs being executed inside the processor cores. Many studies show that only in a small fraction of the system execution, e.g. 13% of the time, the processors fully occupy its dedicated clock cycle. This brings a new opportunity to enhance the processors and accelerators\\' performance by exploiting the dynamic timing slack based on the instructions being executed inside the programs. This chapter presents the recent developments on the “dynamic timing enhanced computing scheme” where excessive runtime timing margin is utilized for boosting the computing performance on both microprocessors and deep learning accelerators. Simulation and test chip measurement results are presented to elaborate the benefits of the dynamic timing enhanced computing scheme in terms of performance and energy saving on modern processors. Both hardware design and software techniques using compiler optimization are presented as a holistic solution.",

        "abstract": "The goodness measure of any institute lies in minimising the dropouts and targeting good placements. So, predicting students' performance is very interesting and an important task for educational information systems. Machine learning and deep learning are the emerging areas that truly entice more research practices. This research focuses on applying the deep learning methods to educational data for classification and prediction. The educational data of students from engineering domain with cognitive and non-cognitive parameters is considered. The hybrid model with support vector machine (SVM) and deep belief network (DBN) is devised. The SVM predicts class labels from preprocessed data. These class labels and actual class labels act as input to the DBN to perform final classification. The hybrid model is further optimised using cuckoo search with levy flight. The results clearly show that the proposed model SVM-LCDBN gives better performance as compared to simple hybrid model and hybrid model with traditional cuckoo search. ",

        "abstract": "Conversational AI has seen unprecedented growth in recent years due to which Chatbots have been made available. Conversational AI primarily focuses on text or speech inputs, identifying the intention behind them, and responding to users with relevant information. Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Machine Learning (ML), and speech recognition offer a personalized experience that mimics human-like engagement in conversational AI systems. Conversational AI systems like Google Meena, Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook’s BlenderBot, and OpenAI’s GPT-3 are trained using Deep Learning (DL) techniques that mimic a human brain-like structure and are trained on huge amounts of text data to provide open-domain conversations. The aim of this chapter is to highlight Conversational AI and NLP techniques behind it. The chapter focuses on DL architectures useful in building Conversational AI systems. The chapter discusses what are the recent advances in Conversational AI and how they are useful, what are the challenges, and what is the scope and future of conversational AI. This will help researchers to understand state-of-the-art frameworks and how they are useful in building Conversational AI models.",

        "abstract": "<p>Name of a person reflects a lot about his origin, gender and more. Naming is a fragment of language and can be an identifier as it contains patterns that could be learned in order to classify individual’s gender based on their names (first name and middle name). In this paper a multi-national, multi-ethnicity and multi-language names (first name) based classification or guessing of gender is per-formed by popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Recent advancements of various Artificial Intelligence inspired algorithms offer various options for text classification. This paper investigates first name based gender identification on a dataset of 84,899 first names and middle name initials with gender labels. The algorithms tested on this task are Support Vector Classifications (linear and non-linear), Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and a simple embedding based deep learning model (SimpleText). Among the models the significant results out of this study is that linear model (94.62%) performs equivalent with the complex machine learning models and the simple embedding based deep learning network SimpleText outperforms (94.67%) all the models, even the other Recurrent and Convolutional networks </p>",

        "abstract": "In the information era, enormous amounts of data have become available on hand to decision makers. Big data refers to datasets that are not only big, but also high in variety and velocity, which makes them difficult to handle using traditional tools and techniques. Due to the rapid growth of such data, solutions need to be studiedand provided in order to handle and extract value and knowledge from these datasets. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Such minimal human intervention can be provided using big data analytics, which is the application of advanced analytics techniques on big data. This paper aims to analyse some of the different machine learning algorithms and methods which can be applied to big data analysis, as well as the opportunities provided by the application of big data analytics in various decision making domains.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel algorithm for deep reinforcement learning named Expert Q-learning. Expert Q-learning is inspired by Dueling Q-learning and aims to incorporate semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning through splitting Q-values into state values and action advantages. We require that an offline expert assesses the value of a state in a coarse manner using three discrete values. An expert network is designed in addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular offline minibatch update whenever the expert example buffer is not empty. Using the board game Othello, we compare our algorithm with the baseline Q-learning algorithm, which is a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling Q-learning. Our results show that Expert Q-learning is indeed useful and more resistant to the overestimation bias. The baseline Q-learning algorithm exhibits unstable and suboptimal behavior in non-deterministic settings, whereas Expert Q-learning demonstrates more robust performance with higher scores, illustrating that our algorithm is indeed suitable to integrate state values from expert examples into Q-learning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs a great Chinese thinker and writer in the 20th century, Lu Xun and his literary works are widely known. However, as a successful cultural communication activist, editor and publisher, we still need to conduct in-depth research on Lu Xun in many aspects. Therefore, based on deep learning, this paper constructs an online multimedia learning system of Lu Xun Literature. This system takes the relationship between classical Lu Xun Literature and modern multimedia technology as the research object,and compare the calculation effect of other different types of algorithms and this dhraa algorithm. Through the availability of data, the dhraa algorithm is significantly better than other algorithms in the recommendation accuracy, thus proving its effectiveness.This system is managed by two servers and one system. The two servers are database server and web server respectively. After testing, the system has good bearing capacity, can make up for the limited processing capacity of the server, and ensure the system has high performance. Its performance characteristics also show that the system achieved the expected performance. This paper systematically combines Lu Xun's literature with modern multimedia, which can provide online learning services for Lu Xun's literature lovers, thus helping scholars to expand Lu Xun's research field and academic vision. This paper designs an effective online learning system of Lu Xun's literature by combining deep learning, multimedia technology and Lu Xun's literature.",

        "abstract": "Modern microprocessors such as CPU, GPU, and the recent deep learning accelerators exhibit significant runtime timing variation, i.e. dynamic timing slack due to the diverse instructions and programs being executed inside the processor cores. Many studies show that only in a small fraction of the system execution, e.g. 13% of the time, the processors fully occupy its dedicated clock cycle. This brings a new opportunity to enhance the processors and accelerators\\' performance by exploiting the dynamic timing slack based on the instructions being executed inside the programs. This chapter presents the recent developments on the “dynamic timing enhanced computing scheme” where excessive runtime timing margin is utilized for boosting the computing performance on both microprocessors and deep learning accelerators. Simulation and test chip measurement results are presented to elaborate the benefits of the dynamic timing enhanced computing scheme in terms of performance and energy saving on modern processors. Both hardware design and software techniques using compiler optimization are presented as a holistic solution.",

The proposed methods take inspiration from the highly successful ResNet and YOLO deep learning models and tailor them to the idiosyncrasies of the seafloor pipeline detection task.\r\nWe use the area between lines and Hausdorff line distance functions to accurately evaluate how well methods can localize (pipe)lines. The same functions also show promise as loss functions compared to standard mean squared error, which does not include the regression variables' geometrical interpretation.\r\nThe model outperforms the highest likelihood baseline by more than 35% on a region-wise F1-score classification evaluation while being more than eight times more accurate than the baseline in locating pipelines. It is efficient, operating at over eighteen 32-ping image segments per second, which is far beyond real-time requirements.",

        "abstract": "<p>Name of a person reflects a lot about his origin, gender and more. Naming is a fragment of language and can be an identifier as it contains patterns that could be learned in order to classify individual’s gender based on their names (first name and middle name). In this paper a multi-national, multi-ethnicity and multi-language names (first name) based classification or guessing of gender is per-formed by popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Recent advancements of various Artificial Intelligence inspired algorithms offer various options for text classification. This paper investigates first name based gender identification on a dataset of 84,899 first names and middle name initials with gender labels. The algorithms tested on this task are Support Vector Classifications (linear and non-linear), Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and a simple embedding based deep learning model (SimpleText). Among the models the significant results out of this study is that linear model (94.62%) performs equivalent with the complex machine learning models and the simple embedding based deep learning network SimpleText outperforms (94.67%) all the models, even the other Recurrent and Convolutional networks </p>",

        "abstract": "Text separation in document image analysis is an important preprocessing step before executing an optical character recognition (OCR) task. It is necessary to improve the accuracy of an OCR system. Traditionally, for separating text from a document, different feature extraction processes have been used that require handcrafting of the features. However, deep learning-based methods are excellent feature extractors that learn features from the training data automatically. Deep learning gives state-of-the-art results on various computer vision, image classification, segmentation, image captioning, object detection, and recognition tasks. This chapter compares various traditional as well as deep-learning techniques and uses a semantic segmentation method for separating text from Devanagari document images using U-Net and ResU-Net models. These models are further fine-tuned for transfer learning to get more precise results. The final results show that deep learning methods give more accurate results compared with conventional methods of image processing for Devanagari text extraction. ",

One of the most interesting topic of current interest is dark matter and its existence is by now well established. By analyzing the CMB data we can estimate the baryon matter and dark matter density of the universe. With vast amount of astronomical data already present and a more vast amount which is to come in future, Machine Learning techniques can provide a variety of benefits in astrophysical and cosmological research. Here we explore the use of deep learning to estimate baryon and dark matter density. We have used a U-Net based neural networks in this paper. We have used simulated CMB temperature maps as a dataset to train the neural networks and correlate the baryon and dark matter density from the power spectrum of the corresponding simulated CMB temperature map.",

Expert Q-learning is inspired by Dueling Q-learning and aims to incorporate semi-supervised learning into reinforcement learning through splitting Q-values into state values and action advantages. We require that an offline expert assesses the value of a state in a coarse manner using three discrete values. An expert network is designed in addition to the Q-network, which updates each time following the regular offline minibatch update whenever the expert example buffer is not empty. Using the board game Othello, we compare our algorithm with the baseline Q-learning algorithm, which is a combination of Double Q-learning and Dueling Q-learning. Our results show that Expert Q-learning is indeed useful and more resistant to the overestimation bias. The baseline Q-learning algorithm exhibits unstable and suboptimal behavior in non-deterministic settings, whereas Expert Q-learning demonstrates more robust performance with higher scores, illustrating that our algorithm is indeed suitable to integrate state values from expert examples into Q-learning.",

The same functions also show promise as loss functions compared to standard mean squared error, which does not include the regression variables' geometrical interpretation.\r\nThe model outperforms the highest likelihood baseline by more than 35% on a region-wise F1-score classification evaluation while being more than eight times more accurate than the baseline in locating pipelines. It is efficient, operating at over eighteen 32-ping image segments per second, which is far beyond real-time requirements.",

        "abstract": "<p>Name of a person reflects a lot about his origin, gender and more. Naming is a fragment of language and can be an identifier as it contains patterns that could be learned in order to classify individual’s gender based on their names (first name and middle name). In this paper a multi-national, multi-ethnicity and multi-language names (first name) based classification or guessing of gender is per-formed by popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Recent advancements of various Artificial Intelligence inspired algorithms offer various options for text classification. This paper investigates first name based gender identification on a dataset of 84,899 first names and middle name initials with gender labels. The algorithms tested on this task are Support Vector Classifications (linear and non-linear), Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network and a simple embedding based deep learning model (SimpleText). Among the models the significant results out of this study is that linear model (94.62%) performs equivalent with the complex machine learning models and the simple embedding based deep learning network SimpleText outperforms (94.67%) all the models, even the other Recurrent and Convolutional networks </p>",

        "abstract": "1AbstractBy capitalizing on the power of multivariate analyses of large datasets, predictive modeling approaches are enabling progress toward robust and reproducible brain-based markers of neuropsychiatric conditions. While Deep Learning offers a particularly promising avenue to further advance progress, there are challenges related to implementation in 3D (best for MRI) and interpretability. Here, we address these challenges and describe an interpretable predictive pipeline for inferring Autism diagnosis using 3D Deep Learning applied to minimally processed structural MRI scans. We trained 3D Deep Learning models to predict Autism diagnosis using the openly available ABIDE I and II datasets (n = 1329, split into training, validation, and test sets). Importantly, we did not perform transformation to template space, to reduce bias and maximize sensitivity to structural alterations associated with Autism. Our models attained predictive accuracies equivalent to those of previous Machine Learning studies, while side-stepping the time- and resource-demanding requirement to first normalize data to a template, thus minimizing the time required to generate predictions. Further, our interpretation step, which identified brain regions that contributed most to accurate inference, revealed regional Autism-related alterations that were highly consistent with the literature, such as in a left-lateralized network of regions supporting language processing. We have openly shared our code and models to enable further progress towards remaining challenges, such as the clinical heterogeneity of Autism, and to enable the extension of our method to other neuropsychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is an approach to artificial intelligence (AI) centered on the training of deep artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks. Since the early 21st century, this approach has led to record-breaking advances in AI, allowing computers to solve complex board games, video games, natural language-processing tasks, and vision problems. Neuroscientists and psychologists have also utilized these networks as models of biological information processing to understand language, motor control, cognition, audition, and—most commonly—vision. Specifically, early feedforward network architectures were inspired by visual neuroscience and are used to model neural activity and human behavior. They also provide useful representations of the perceptual space of images. The extent to which these models match data, however, depends on the methods used to characterize and compare them. The limitations of these feedforward neural networks to account for, for example, simple visual reasoning tasks, suggests that feedback mechanisms may be necessary to solve visual recognition tasks beyond image categorization.",

        "abstract": "In the information era, enormous amounts of data have become available on hand to decision makers. Big data refers to datasets that are not only big, but also high in variety and velocity, which makes them difficult to handle using traditional tools and techniques. Due to the rapid growth of such data, solutions need to be studied and provided in order to handle and extract value and knowledge from these datasets. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Such minimal human intervention can be provided using machine learning, which is the application of advanced deep learning techniques on big data. This paper aims to analyse some of the different machine learning and deep learning algorithms and methods, aswell as the opportunities provided by the AI applications in various decision making domains.",

        "abstract": "An accessible introduction to the artificial intelligence technology that enables computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, and driverless cars.\nDeep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that enables computer vision, speech recognition in mobile phones, machine translation, AI games, driverless cars, and other applications. When we use consumer products from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, or Baidu, we are often interacting with a deep learning system. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence revolution.\nKelleher explains that deep learning enables data-driven decisions by identifying and extracting patterns from large datasets; its ability to learn from complex data makes deep learning ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in big data and computational power. Kelleher also explains some of the basic concepts in deep learning, presents a history of advances in the field, and discusses the current state of the art. He describes the most important deep learning architectures, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term networks, as well as such recent developments as Generative Adversarial Networks and capsule networks. He also provides a comprehensive (and comprehensible) introduction to the two fundamental algorithms in deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation. Finally, Kelleher considers the future of deep learning—major trends, possible developments, and significant challenges.",

        "abstract": "Developing deep neural models for continuous recognition of sign gestures\nand generation of sign videos from spoken sentences is still challenging and requires\nmuch investigation in earlier studies. Although the recent approaches provide plausible\nsolutions for these tasks, they still fail to perform well in handling continuous sentences\nand visual quality aspects. The recent advancements in deep learning techniques\nenvisioned new milestones in handling such complex tasks and producing impressive\nresults. This paper proposes novel approaches to develop a deep neural framework for\nrecognizing multilingual sign datasets and multimodal sign gestures. In addition to that,\nthe proposed model generates sign gesture videos from spoken sentences. In the first\nfold, it deals with the sign gesture recognition tasks using a hybrid CNN-LSTM\nalgorithm. The second fold uses the hybrid NMT-GAN techniques to produce high quality sign gesture videos. The proposed model has been evaluated using different\nquality metrics. We also compared the proposed model performance qualitatively using\ndifferent benchmark sign language datasets. The proposed model achieves 98%\nclassification accuracy and improved video quality in sign language recognition and\nvideo generation tasks.",

Hence early diagnosis is very important along the progress of the disease. This paper focuses on coronavirus detection using x-ray images, for automating the diagnosis pipeline using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. This could be deployed in places where radiologists are not easily available in order to detect the disease at very early stages. In this study we propose our deep learning architecture for the classification task, which is trained with modified images, through multiple steps of preprocessing. Our classification method uses convolutional neural networks and transfer learning architecture for classifying the images. Our findings yield an accuracy value of 91.03%, precision of 89.76 %, recall value of 96.67% and F1 score of 93.09%.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is an approach to artificial intelligence (AI) centered on the training of deep artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks. Since the early 21st century, this approach has led to record-breaking advances in AI, allowing computers to solve complex board games, video games, natural language-processing tasks, and vision problems. Neuroscientists and psychologists have also utilized these networks as models of biological information processing to understand language, motor control, cognition, audition, and—most commonly—vision. Specifically, early feedforward network architectures were inspired by visual neuroscience and are used to model neural activity and human behavior. They also provide useful representations of the perceptual space of images. The extent to which these models match data, however, depends on the methods used to characterize and compare them. The limitations of these feedforward neural networks to account for, for example, simple visual reasoning tasks, suggests that feedback mechanisms may be necessary to solve visual recognition tasks beyond image categorization.",

Big data refers to datasets that are not only big, but also high in variety and velocity, which makes them difficult to handle using traditional tools and techniques. Due to the rapid growth of such data, solutions need to be studied and provided in order to handle and extract value and knowledge from these datasets. Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Such minimal human intervention can be provided using machine learning, which is the application of advanced deep learning techniques on big data. This paper aims to analyse some of the different machine learning and deep learning algorithms and methods, aswell as the opportunities provided by the AI applications in various decision making domains.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL), which is originated from an artificial neural network (ANN), is one of the major technologies of today's smart cybersecurity systems or policies to function in an intelligent manner. Popular deep learning techniques, such as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Self-organizing Map (SOM), Auto-Encoder (AE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Deep Transfer Learning (DTL or Deep TL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL or Deep RL), or their ensembles and hybrid approaches can be used to intelligently tackle the diverse cybersecurity issues. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive overview from the perspective of these neural networks and deep learning techniques according to today's diverse needs. We also discuss the applicability of these techniques in various cybersecurity tasks such as intrusion detection, identification of malware or botnets, phishing, predicting cyber-attacks, e.g. denial of service (DoS), fraud detection or cyber-anomalies, etc. Finally, we highlight several research issues and future directions within the scope of our study in the field. Overall, the ultimate goal of this paper is to serve as a reference point and guidelines for the academia and professionals in the cyber industries, especially from the deep learning point of view.",

        "abstract": "Text separation in document image analysis is an important preprocessing step before executing an optical character recognition (OCR) task. It is necessary to improve the accuracy of an OCR system. Traditionally, for separating text from a document, different feature extraction processes have been used that require handcrafting of the features. However, deep learning-based methods are excellent feature extractors that learn features from the training data automatically. Deep learning gives state-of-the-art results on various computer vision, image classification, segmentation, image captioning, object detection, and recognition tasks. This chapter compares various traditional as well as deep-learning techniques and uses a semantic segmentation method for separating text from Devanagari document images using U-Net and ResU-Net models. These models are further fine-tuned for transfer learning to get more precise results. The final results show that deep learning methods give more accurate results compared with conventional methods of image processing for Devanagari text extraction. ",

When we use consumer products from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, or Baidu, we are often interacting with a deep learning system. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, computer scientist John Kelleher offers an accessible and concise but comprehensive introduction to the fundamental technology at the heart of the artificial intelligence revolution.\nKelleher explains that deep learning enables data-driven decisions by identifying and extracting patterns from large datasets; its ability to learn from complex data makes deep learning ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in big data and computational power. Kelleher also explains some of the basic concepts in deep learning, presents a history of advances in the field, and discusses the current state of the art. He describes the most important deep learning architectures, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term networks, as well as such recent developments as Generative Adversarial Networks and capsule networks. He also provides a comprehensive (and comprehensible) introduction to the two fundamental algorithms in deep learning: gradient descent and backpropagation. Finally, Kelleher considers the future of deep learning—major trends, possible developments, and significant challenges.",

One of the most interesting topic of current interest is dark matter and its existence is by now well established. By analyzing the CMB data we can estimate the baryon matter and dark matter density of the universe. With vast amount of astronomical data already present and a more vast amount which is to come in future, Machine Learning techniques can provide a variety of benefits in astrophysical and cosmological research. Here we explore the use of deep learning to estimate baryon and dark matter density. We have used a U-Net based neural networks in this paper. We have used simulated CMB temperature maps as a dataset to train the neural networks and correlate the baryon and dark matter density from the power spectrum of the corresponding simulated CMB temperature map.",

In addition, many pathologists may feel that they do not possess the necessary skills to allow them to embark on research into this field. This article aims to act as an introductory tutorial to illustrate how to create, train, and evaluate simple artificial learning models (neural networks) on histopathology data sets in the programming language Python using the popular freely available, open-source libraries Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Detecto. Furthermore, it aims to introduce pathologists to commonly used terms and concepts used in artificial intelligence.",

        "abstract": "The year 2019 witnessed the rollout of the 5G standard, which promises to offer significant data rate improvement over 4G. While 5G is still in its infancy, there has been an increased shift in the research community for communication technologies beyond 5G. The recent emergence of machine learning approaches for enhancing wireless communications and empowering them with much-desired intelligence holds immense potential for redefining wireless communication for 6G. The evolving communication systems will be bottlenecked in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability by the underlying signal processing at the physical layer. In this position paper, we motivate the need to redesign iterative signal processing algorithms by leveraging deep unfolding techniques to fulfill the physical layer requirements for 6G networks. To this end, we begin by presenting the service requirements and the key challenges posed by the envisioned 6G communication architecture. We outline the deficiencies of the traditional algorithmic principles and data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in the context of 6G networks. Specifically, deep unfolded signal processing is presented by sketching the interplay between domain knowledge and DL. The deep unfolded approaches reviewed in this article are positioned explicitly in the context of the requirements imposed by the next generation of cellular networks. Finally, this article motivates open research challenges to truly realize hardware-efficient edge intelligence for future 6G networks.<br>",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has become popular in all aspect related to human judgments. Most machine learning techniques work well which includes text classification, text sequence learning, sentiment analysis, question-answer engine, etc. This paper has been focused on two objectives, firstly is to study the applicability of deep neural networks strategies for extracting sentiment present in social media data and customer reviews with effective training solutions. The second objective is to design deep networks that can be trained with these weakly supervised strategies in order to predict meaningful inferences. This paper presents the concept and steps of using deep learning for extraction sentiments from customer reviews. The extraction pulls out the features from the customer reviews using deep learning popular methods including Convolution neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. The comparison of the results with tradition text classification method such as Naive Bayes(NB) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) using two data sets IMDB reviews and Amazon customer reviews have been presented. This work mainly focused on investigating the merit of using deep models for sentiment analysis in customer reviews.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning (DL) computing has become more popular in the\nmachine learning (ML) community. In the field of ML, the most widely used\ncomputational approach is DL. It can solve many complex problems, cognitive tasks,\nand matching problems without any human performance or interface. ML cannot\nhandle large amounts of data and DL can easily handle it. In the last few years, the field\nof DL has witnessed success in a range of applications. DL outperformed in many\napplication domains, e.g., robotics, bioinformatics, agriculture, cybersecurity, natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), medical information processing, etc. Despite various\nreviews on the state of the art in DL, they all concentrated on a single aspect of it,\nresulting in a general lack of understanding. There is a need to provide a better\nbeginning point for comprehending DL. This paper aims to provide a more\ncomprehensive overview of DL, including current advancements. This paper discusses\nthe importance of DL and introduces DL approaches and networks. It then explains\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), the most widely used DL network type and\nsubsequent evolved model starting with LeNET, AlexNet with the Letnet-5, AlexNet,\nGoogleNet, and ResNet networks, and ending with the High-Resolution network.

        "abstract": "1AbstractBy capitalizing on the power of multivariate analyses of large datasets, predictive modeling approaches are enabling progress toward robust and reproducible brain-based markers of neuropsychiatric conditions. While Deep Learning offers a particularly promising avenue to further advance progress, there are challenges related to implementation in 3D (best for MRI) and interpretability. Here, we address these challenges and describe an interpretable predictive pipeline for inferring Autism diagnosis using 3D Deep Learning applied to minimally processed structural MRI scans. We trained 3D Deep Learning models to predict Autism diagnosis using the openly available ABIDE I and II datasets (n = 1329, split into training, validation, and test sets). Importantly, we did not perform transformation to template space, to reduce bias and maximize sensitivity to structural alterations associated with Autism. Our models attained predictive accuracies equivalent to those of previous Machine Learning studies, while side-stepping the time- and resource-demanding requirement to first normalize data to a template, thus minimizing the time required to generate predictions. Further, our interpretation step, which identified brain regions that contributed most to accurate inference, revealed regional Autism-related alterations that were highly consistent with the literature, such as in a left-lateralized network of regions supporting language processing. We have openly shared our code and models to enable further progress towards remaining challenges, such as the clinical heterogeneity of Autism, and to enable the extension of our method to other neuropsychiatric conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomated teleseismic earthquake monitoring is an essential part of global seismicity analysis. Although constraining epicenters in an automated fashion is an established technique, constraining event depths is substantially more difficult. One solution to this challenge is teleseismic depth phases, but these can currently not be identified precisely by automatic detection methods. Here, we propose two deep-learning models, DepthPhaseTEAM and DepthPhaseNet, to detect and pick depth phases. For training the models, we create a dataset based on the ISC-EHB bulletin—a high-quality catalog with detailed phase annotations. We show how backprojecting the predicted phase arrival probability curves onto the depth axis yields accurate estimates of earthquake depth. Furthermore, we show how a multistation model, DepthPhaseTEAM, leads to better and more consistent predictions than the single-station model, DepthPhaseNet. To allow direct application of our models, we integrate them within the SeisBench library.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL), which is originated from an artificial neural network (ANN), is one of the major technologies of today's smart cybersecurity systems or policies to function in an intelligent manner. Popular deep learning techniques, such as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Self-organizing Map (SOM), Auto-Encoder (AE), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Deep Transfer Learning (DTL or Deep TL), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL or Deep RL), or their ensembles and hybrid approaches can be used to intelligently tackle the diverse cybersecurity issues. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive overview from the perspective of these neural networks and deep learning techniques according to today's diverse needs. We also discuss the applicability of these techniques in various cybersecurity tasks such as intrusion detection, identification of malware or botnets, phishing, predicting cyber-attacks, e.g. denial of service (DoS), fraud detection or cyber-anomalies, etc. Finally, we highlight several research issues and future directions within the scope of our study in the field. Overall, the ultimate goal of this paper is to serve as a reference point and guidelines for the academia and professionals in the cyber industries, especially from the deep learning point of view.",

        "abstract": "Today, such a branch of science as «artificial intelligence» is booming in the world. Systems built on the basis of artificial intelligence methods have the ability to perform functions that are traditionally considered the prerogative of man. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of research areas. One such area is machine learning. This article discusses the algorithms of one of the approaches of machine learning – reinforcement learning (RL), according to which a lot of research and development has been carried out over the past seven years. Development and research on this approach is mainly carried out to solve problems in Atari 2600 games or in other similar ones. In this article, reinforcement training will be applied to one of the dynamic objects – an inverted pendulum. As a model of this object, we consider a model of an inverted pendulum on a cart taken from the Gym library, which contains many models that are used to test and analyze reinforcement learning algorithms. The article describes the implementation and study of two algorithms from this approach, Deep Q-learning and Double Deep Q-learning. As a result, training, testing and training time graphs for each algorithm are presented, on the basis of which it is concluded that it is desirable to use the Double Deep Q-learning algorithm, because the training time is approximately 2 minutes and provides the best control for the model of an inverted pendulum on a cart.",

        "abstract": "Big data analytics and deep learning are nowadays two of the most active research areas in computer science. As the data is becoming bigger and bigger, deep learning has a very important role to play in data analytics, and big data technologies will give it huge opportunities for different sectors. Deep learning brings new challenges especially when it comes to large amounts of data, the volume of datasets has to be processed and managed, also data in various applications come in a streaming way and deep learning approaches have to deal with this kind of applications. In this paper, the authors propose two novel approaches for discriminative deep learning, namely LS-DSN, and StreamDSN that are inspired from the deep stacking network algorithm. Two versions of the gradient descent algorithm were used to train the proposed algorithms. The experiment results have shown that the algorithms gave satisfying accuracy results and scale well when the size of data increases. In addition, StreamDSN algorithm have been applied to classify beats of ECG signals and provided good promising results. ",

Such models are most accurate when applied to test data drawn from the same distribution as their training set. However, in practice, the data confronting models in real-world settings rarely match the training distribution.  This study explores the use of co-design approaches for developing reliable design frameworks for deep learning systems. It aims to raise awareness on how to develop reliable ML models within the context of recommender systems. While much work needs to be done in this field, the study provides suggestions and practical tips for how to develop reliable ML models such as in the case of recommender systems",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning (DL) computing has become more popular in the\nmachine learning (ML) community. In the field of ML, the most widely used\ncomputational approach is DL. It can solve many complex problems, cognitive tasks,\nand matching problems without any human performance or interface. ML cannot\nhandle large amounts of data and DL can easily handle it. In the last few years, the field\nof DL has witnessed success in a range of applications. DL outperformed in many\napplication domains, e.g., robotics, bioinformatics, agriculture, cybersecurity, natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), medical information processing, etc. Despite various\nreviews on the state of the art in DL, they all concentrated on a single aspect of it,\nresulting in a general lack of understanding. There is a need to provide a better\nbeginning point for comprehending DL. This paper aims to provide a more\ncomprehensive overview of DL, including current advancements. This paper discusses\nthe importance of DL and introduces DL approaches and networks. It then explains\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), the most widely used DL network type and\nsubsequent evolved model starting with LeNET, AlexNet with the Letnet-5, AlexNet,\nGoogleNet, and ResNet networks, and ending with the High-Resolution network. This\npaper also discusses the difficulties and solutions to help researchers recognize research\ngaps for DL applications.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has become popular in all aspect related to human judgments. Most machine learning techniques work well which includes text classification, text sequence learning, sentiment analysis, question-answer engine, etc. This paper has been focused on two objectives, firstly is to study the applicability of deep neural networks strategies for extracting sentiment present in social media data and customer reviews with effective training solutions. The second objective is to design deep networks that can be trained with these weakly supervised strategies in order to predict meaningful inferences. This paper presents the concept and steps of using deep learning for extraction sentiments from customer reviews. The extraction pulls out the features from the customer reviews using deep learning popular methods including Convolution neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. The comparison of the results with tradition text classification method such as Naive Bayes(NB) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) using two data sets IMDB reviews and Amazon customer reviews have been presented. This work mainly focused on investigating the merit of using deep models for sentiment analysis in customer reviews.",

The rapid development of chatbot technology has led to a plethora of research studies exploring the use of deep learning techniques to enhance chatbot performance. However, there is a need for a systematic analysis to synthesize and evaluate the findings across these studies. In this study, we conduct a meta-analysis to identify the key trends, insights, and performance metrics associated with deep learning models in machine learning chatbots. The analysis includes a thorough examination of the various deep learning architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation metrics employed in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations and potential biases in the analyzed studies and provide recommendations for future research directions. The findings of this meta-analysis contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness and challenges of deep learning models in machine learning chatbots, thereby guiding researchers and practitioners in the development and improvement of chatbot systems.",

        "abstract": "Application security is an essential part of developing modern software, as lots of attacks depend on vulnerabilities in software. The number of attacks is increasing globally due to technological advancements. Companies must include security in every stage of developing, testing, and deploying their software in order to prevent data breaches. There are several methods to detect software vulnerability Non-AI-based such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). However, these approaches have substantial false-positive and false-negative rates. On the other side, researchers have been interested in developing an AI-based vulnerability detection system employing deep learning models like BERT, BLSTM, etc. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage solution, two deep learning models were proposed for vulnerability detection in C/C++ source codes, the first stage is CNN which detects if the source code contains any vulnerability (binary classification model) and the second stage is CNN-LTSM that classifies this vulnerability into a class of 50 different types of vulnerabilities (multiclass classification model). Experiments were done on SySeVR dataset. Results show an accuracy of 99% for the first and 98% for the second stage.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomated teleseismic earthquake monitoring is an essential part of global seismicity analysis. Although constraining epicenters in an automated fashion is an established technique, constraining event depths is substantially more difficult. One solution to this challenge is teleseismic depth phases, but these can currently not be identified precisely by automatic detection methods. Here, we propose two deep-learning models, DepthPhaseTEAM and DepthPhaseNet, to detect and pick depth phases. For training the models, we create a dataset based on the ISC-EHB bulletin—a high-quality catalog with detailed phase annotations. We show how backprojecting the predicted phase arrival probability curves onto the depth axis yields accurate estimates of earthquake depth. Furthermore, we show how a multistation model, DepthPhaseTEAM, leads to better and more consistent predictions than the single-station model, DepthPhaseNet. To allow direct application of our models, we integrate them within the SeisBench library.",

Like any\nother organ, our brain may suffer from various life-threatening diseases like brain\ntumours which can be malignant or benign. Analysis of the brain MRI images by\napplying convolution neural networks or artificial neural networks can automate this\nprocess by classifying these images into various types of tumours. A faster and more\neffective method can be provided by this method for detecting the disease at a key\nstage from where recovery is possible.\nSleep apnea is a sleeping disorder involving irregular breathing. The brain detects a\nsudden decrease in the level of oxygen and sends a signal to wake the person up while\nhe is sleeping. Cardiac arrhythmia refers to a group of conditions that causes the heart\nto beat irregularly, too slowly, or too quickly, e.g., atrial fibrillation. Deep learning\nalong with bio-medical signal and audio processing techniques on respiratory sound\ndatasets and ECG datasets have huge potential in the detection of these diseases. Deep\nlearning outperforms the existing detection algorithms and a good amount of effort on\nfeature engineering, augmentation techniques, and building effective filters can get a\nhigh accuracy result.",

        "abstract": "With the high advancements in technology and cellular world, comes the frowning situation of endangering bird species. Bird sound classification and prediction model is a step towards the process of conserving the bird species.\nThe deep learning advancements helps to bring the solution to the problem of bird species identification from audio recordings. It is efficient and economical to identify and classify different bird species by audio recordings using machine learning algorithms and artificial models. Of course, there are challenges like choosing the right model that would minimize the signal to noise ratio between the training and test datasets.\nObserving different experiments on a few models, CNN( Convolutional Neural Network ) and ANN( Artificial Neural Network ) promised highest accuracy of which ANN showed results. During the analysis of the dataset and model, the implementation graphical representation of the model performance and visual understanding of the dataset enhance the observation and provide more insightful knowledge of the dataset.\nBird identification is a difficult undertaking that frequently results in ambiguous labeling. Even skilled bird watchers dispute the species of a bird when presented with an image of one. It’s a demanding task that tests both people and computer’s visual talents. Although different bird species have the same core set of elements, their shape and appearance can change drastically. Due to differences in lighting and background, as well as great diversity in stance, intraclass variance is high (e.g., flying birds, swimming birds, and perched birds that are partially occluded by branches). Human knowledge of a species is insufficient to reliably identify a bird species, as it necessitates a great deal of skill in the subject of ornithology. Our study intends to use machine learning to assist amateur bird watchers in identifying bird species from photographs This research provides a deep neural network-based automate model for automatically identifying the species of a bird supplied as the test dataset. For 400 different bird species, the model was trained and evaluated.\n",

Log analysis is considered to be an indispensable component of security regulations and framework, since these computer-generated records help the organizations, businesses and networks to respond to different kinds of risks that are possible to cloud environment in a reactive and proactive manner. In this paper, an Integrated Deep Auto-Encoder and Q-learning-based Deep Learning (IDEA-QLDL) Scheme is proposed for attaining maximum prediction accuracy during the process of exploring log data and classifying them into genuine and anomalous. It initiates the process of acceptance or denial based on the continuous investigation of behavioral patterns that are highly applicable for classification. The results of the proposed IDEA-QLDL Scheme confirmed its predominance in improving the classification accuracy, precision, recall and detection time compared to the benchmarked schemes considered for investigation.",

        "abstract": "CAPTCHA is a human-centred test to distinguish a human operator from bots, attacking programs, or other computerised agents that tries to imitate human intelligence. In this research, we investigate a way to crack visual CAPTCHA tests by an automated deep learning based solution. The goal of this research is to investigate the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the CAPTCHA generator systems; hence, developing more robust CAPTCHAs, without taking the risks of manual try and fail efforts. We develop a Convolutional Neural Network called Deep-CAPTCHA to achieve this goal. The proposed platform is able to investigate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs. To train and develop an efficient model, we have generated a dataset of 500,000 CAPTCHAs to train our model. In this paper, we present our customised deep neural network model, we review the research gaps, the existing challenges, and the solutions to cope with the issues. Our network's cracking accuracy leads to a high rate of 98.94% and 98.31% for the numerical and the alpha-numerical test datasets, respectively.

        "abstract": "Music source separation represents the task of extracting all the instruments from a given song. Recent breakthroughs on this challenge have gravitated around a single dataset, MUSDB, only limited to four instrument classes. Larger datasets and more instruments are costly and time-consuming in collecting data and training deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we propose a fast method to evaluate the separability of instruments in any dataset without training and tuning a DNN.This separability measure helps to select appropriate samples for the efficient training of neural networks. Based on the oracle principle with an ideal ratio mask, our approach is an excellent proxy to estimate the separation performances of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as TasNet or Open-Unmix.Our results contribute to revealing two essential points for audio source separation: 1) the ideal ratio mask, although light and straightforward, provides an accurate measure of the audio separability performance of recent neural nets, and 2) new end-to-end learning methods such as Tasnet, that operate directly on waveforms, are, in fact, internally building a Time-Frequency (TF) representation, so that they encounter the same limitations as the TF based-methods when separating audio pattern overlapping in the TF plane.

        "abstract": "Skin cancer is a serious health hazard for human society. This disease is developed when the pigments that produce skin color become cancerous. Dermatologists face difficulties in diagnosing skin cancer since many skin cancer colors seem identical. As a result, early diagnosis of lesions (the foundation of skin cancer) is very crucial and beneficial in totally curing skin cancer patients. Significant progress has been made in creating automated methods with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to aid dermatologists in the identification of skin cancer. The widespread acceptance of AI-powered technologies has enabled the use of a massive collection of photos of lesions and benign sores authorized by histology. This research compares six alternative transfer learning networks (deep networks) for skin cancer classification using the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset. DenseNet, Xception, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and MobileNet were the transfer learning networks employed in the investigation which were successful in different studies recently. To compensate for the imbalance in the ISIC dataset, the photos of classes with low frequencies are augmented. The results show that augmentation is appropriate for the classification success, with high classification accuracies and F-scores with decreased false negatives. With an accuracy rate of 98.35%, modified DenseNet121 was the most successful model against the rest of the transfer learning nets utilized in the study.",

        "abstract": "There are various varieties of Rice and lentils. Price fabrication and adulteration have been some of the various issues faced by the consumers, farmers and wholesale retailers. Traditional methods for Identification of these similar types of grains and their quality analysis are crude and inaccurate. Methods were tried to implemented earlier but due to financial inability and low efficiency, they weren’t successful. To overcome this problem, the project proposes a method that uses a machine learning technique for identification and quality analysis of these grains. Rice and Lentils which have the maximum consumption have been selected. Lentils are designated into classes based on colors. The technique of determining the elegance of a lentil is with the aid of seed coat shade. Red lentils can be confirmed through the cotyledon coloration. Lentil types may also have a huge variety of seed coat colors from inexperienced, red, speckled inexperienced, black and tan. The cotyledon colour may be red, yellow or inexperienced. The size and color of every Indian Lentil type (i.e. Red, Green, and Yellow, Black, White) are decided to be large or Medium or small, then size and colour end up part of the grade name. An smart machine is used to perceive the kind of Indian lentils from bulk samples. The proposed machine allows kernel length and coloration size using picture processing techniques. These Lentil size measurements, when combined with color attributes of the sample, classify three lentil varieties commonly grown in India with the highest accuracy. Rice is one of most consumed grains in India so its quality is of utmost importance. In this project, we identify and grade five types of rice and grade them with the help of their distinguished features such as size, color, shape, and surface. The project works in three phases viz., Feature Extraction, Training, and Testing. Various rice grain has a different shape, size, surface and various lentils come in different colors, Hence the feature that will be extracted is texture and colors. The method of regression will be adopted for the grading mechanism where the output will be in terms of percentage purity. The methodology for the extraction of the feature will be GLCM and Edge Detection where for supervised learning SVM and Back Propagation will be utilized. The project provides an efficient replacement for the traditional grading mechanism and standardizes the pricing of farm products based on their quality only.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most severe diseases nowadays. Thus, tumor detection in a non-invasive and accurate manner is a challenging subject. Among these tumors, liver cancer is one of the most dangerous, being very common. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent malignant liver tumor. The golden standard for diagnosing HCC is mainly the biopsy, however invasive and risky, leading to infections, respectively to the spreading of the tumor through the body. We conceive computerized techniques for abdominal tumor recognition within medical images. Formerly, traditional, texture-based methods were involved for this purpose. Both classical texture analysis methods, as well as advanced, original texture analysis techniques, based on superior order statistics, were involved. The superior order Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM), as well as the Textural Microstructure Cooccurrence Matrices (TMCM) were employed and assessed. Recently, deep learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), their fusions with the conventional techniques, as well as their combinations among themselves, were assessed in the approached field. We present the most relevant aspects of this study in the current paper.",

        "abstract": "The year 2019 witnessed the rollout of the 5G standard, which promises to offer significant data rate improvement over 4G. While 5G is still in its infancy, there has been an increased shift in the research community for communication technologies beyond 5G. The recent emergence of machine learning approaches for enhancing wireless communications and empowering them with much-desired intelligence holds immense potential for redefining wireless communication for 6G. The evolving communication systems will be bottlenecked in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability by the underlying signal processing at the physical layer. In this position paper, we motivate the need to redesign iterative signal processing algorithms by leveraging deep unfolding techniques to fulfill the physical layer requirements for 6G networks. To this end, we begin by presenting the service requirements and the key challenges posed by the envisioned 6G communication architecture. We outline the deficiencies of the traditional algorithmic principles and data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in the context of 6G networks. Specifically, deep unfolded signal processing is presented by sketching the interplay between domain knowledge and DL. The deep unfolded approaches reviewed in this article are positioned explicitly in the context of the requirements imposed by the next generation of cellular networks. Finally, this article motivates open research challenges to truly realize hardware-efficient edge intelligence for future 6G networks.<br>",

Many neuroscientists use machine learning to decode neural responses. Many perception scientists try to understand how living organisms recognize objects. To them, deep neural networks offer benchmark accuracies for recognition of learned stimuli. Originally machine learning was inspired by the brain. Today, machine learning is used as a statistical tool to decode brain activity. Tomorrow, deep neural networks might become our best model of brain function. This brief overview of the use of machine learning in biological vision touches on its strengths, weaknesses, milestones, controversies, and current directions.

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and deep learning can be used in the smartest way possible to improve productivity in agriculture. The Food and Agriculture Organization's research shows that the crop's production is rising. One of the finest methods to monitor agricultural yield is through smart agriculture. Applications of ML and deep learning help to discover and resolve problems that crop growth encounters. In agriculture, the production of crops can be enhanced by applying machine learning and deep learning methodologies. These methods demonstrate the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in the agriculture sector. The idea of “smart farming” keeps an eye on all processes, disease prediction, and agricultural pests. ML is used to extract meaningful information from huge datasets. Deep learning evaluates structural characteristics, meteorological data, and climatic factors to help anticipate agricultural diseases using practical and economical techniques. The deep-learning techniques enhance agricultural research's capacity to sense the overall classification of agriculture.",

        "abstract": "The year 2019 witnessed the rollout of the 5G standard, which promises to offer significant data rate improvement over 4G. While 5G is still in its infancy, there has been an increased shift in the research community for communication technologies beyond 5G. The recent emergence of machine learning approaches for enhancing wireless communications and empowering them with much-desired intelligence holds immense potential for redefining wireless communication for 6G. The evolving communication systems will be bottlenecked in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability by the underlying signal processing at the physical layer. In this position paper, we motivate the need to redesign iterative signal processing algorithms by leveraging deep unfolding techniques to fulfill the physical layer requirements for 6G networks. To this end, we begin by presenting the service requirements and the key challenges posed by the envisioned 6G communication architecture. We outline the deficiencies of the traditional algorithmic principles and data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in the context of 6G networks. Specifically, deep unfolded signal processing is presented by sketching the interplay between domain knowledge and DL. The deep unfolded approaches reviewed in this article are positioned explicitly in the context of the requirements imposed by the next generation of cellular networks. Finally, this article motivates open research challenges to truly realize hardware-efficient edge intelligence for future 6G networks.<br>",

Vision-based fire detection systems take advantage of the three fundamental features of fire: color, movement, and shape (fire shape). Work has been done to build smoke and fire detection systems based on images that use security cameras. In this study, fire photos are used to extract features before inputs are made.

So, predicting students' performance is very interesting and an important task for educational information systems. Machine learning and deep learning are the emerging areas that truly entice more research practices. This research focuses on applying the deep learning methods to educational data for classification and prediction. The educational data of students from engineering domain with cognitive and non-cognitive parameters is considered. The hybrid model with support vector machine (SVM) and deep belief network (DBN) is devised. The SVM predicts class labels from preprocessed data. These class labels and actual class labels acts as input to the DBN to perform final classification. The hybrid model is further optimised using cuckoo search with Levy flight. The results clearly show that the proposed model SVM-LCDBN gives better performance as compared to simple hybrid model and hybrid model with traditional cuckoo search. ",

        "abstract": "Accidental fall detection for the elderly who live alone can minimize the risk of death and injuries. In this article, we present a new fall detection method based on \"deep learning and image, where a human body recognition model-DeeperCut is used. First, a camera is used to get the detection source data, and then the video is split into images which can be input into DeeperCut model. The human key point data in the output map and the label of the pictures are used as training data to input into the fall detection neural network. The output model then judges the fall of the subsequent pictures. In addition, the fall detection system is designed and implemented with using Raspberry Pi hardware in a local network environment. The presented method obtains a 100% fall detection rate in the experimental environment. The false positive rate on the test set is around 1.95% which is very low and can be ignored because this will be checked by using SMS, WeChat and other SNS tools to confirm falls. Experimental results show that the proposed fall behavior recognition is effective and feasible to be deployed in home environment. ",

The developmental process involved the creation and progressive refinement of material representational tools, such as notched tallies, knotted strings, and counting boards. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that allows the investigation of how material representations might support number processing in a deep reinforcement learning scenario. In this framework, agents can use an external, discrete state to communicate information to solve a simple numerical estimation task. We find that different perceptual and processing constraints result in different emergent representations, whose specific characteristics can facilitate the learning and communication of numbers.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an adverse rise in neurodegenerative disorders which are commonly found in older people. There has been a lot of research conducted to characterize and diagnose these diseases. Many computational methods, particularly deep learning (DL) models, are being used to diagnose these diseases. In this chapter, the authors conduct an extensive literature survey on neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using deep learning models. Also, they performed a comparative analysis of DL models such as CNN, RNN, ResNet50, DenseNet, etc., which have shown some groundbreaking results for neurodegenerative disease detection and classification using medical image computing including MRI and PET scans. In addition, they have discussed how these DL models are used for feature extraction and to identify disease-relevant biomarkers from high-dimensional data. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the potential of deep learning techniques to revolutionize the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases to collaborate in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn earlier times, crime detection relied solely onhuman observation, lacking efficient methods for detection. Theadvent of CCTV cameras marked a significant advancement incrime detection, but the manual review of video footage byhumans proved to be a time-consuming process. In presentworld, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)have made significant strides, the need for intelligent systems toautomate crime detection in CCTV surveillance has becomeparamount. Such systems can not only detect crimes but alsoclassify them and provide alerts to nearby police stations andambulances, thereby contributing to the reduction of crimerates in any given country. Object detection and tracking incomputer vision have gained widespread attention due to theirdiverse applications, including surveillance and securitysystems. Researchers have diligently worked to improve theaccuracy and efficiency of these processes. Our system aims toenhance security measures and facilitate swift responses topotential threats by employing real-time object detection on livevideo feeds. Furthermore, this system can be further optimizedthrough the integration of specialized hardware, ensuring evenmore robust and efficient crime detection capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is one of the popular machine learning strategies that learns in a supervised or unsupervised manner by forming a cascade of multiple layers of non-linear processing units. It is inspired by the way of information processing and communication pattern of the typical biological nervous system. The deep learning algorithms learn through multiple levels of abstractions and hierarchy of concepts; as a result, it is found to be more efficient than the conventional non-deep machine learning algorithms. This chapter explains the basics of deep learning by highlighting the necessity of deep learning over non-deep learning. It also covers discussion on several recently developed deep learning architectures and popular tools available in market for deep learning, which includes Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, Deeplearning4j, Pylearn2, Theano, CuDDN, CUDA-Convnet, and Matlab.

The quality, sum, readiness, and choice of information are essential to the achievement of a machine learning arrangement. Consequently, this chapter aims to provide an overview of how the system can use technologies along with deep learning and challenges to realize the security challenges IoT can support. Even though calculations can work in any nonexclusive conditions, there are particular rules to determine which calculation would work best under which circumstances. How reinforcement learning deep learning is useful for IoT will also be covered in the chapter. ",

        "abstract": "Distributed deep learning is a branch of machine intelligence in which the runtime of deep learning models may be dramatically lowered by using several accelerators. Most of the past research reports the performance of the data parallelism technique of DDL. Nevertheless, additional parallelism solutions in DDL must be investigated, and their performance modeling for specific applications and application stacks must be reported. Such efforts may aid other researchers in making more informed judgments while creating a successful DDL algorithm. Distributed deep learning strategies are becoming increasingly popular as they allow for training complex models on large datasets in a much shorter time than traditional training methods. TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for building and training machine learning models, provides several distributed training strategies. This chapter provides a detailed evaluation of the different TensorFlow strategies for medical data. The TensorFlow distribution strategy API is utilized to perform distributed training in TensorFlow.",

Given that those human pose analysis methods usually require high labour costs, the authors explore deep learning methods to achieve real-time, high-precision pose recognition. Firstly, they utilize human key point detection technology to extract the key points of players from real-time videos and generate key points. Then, the key point data is input into the transformer model for pose analysis and recognition. In addition, the authors design a human skeletal alignment method for comparison with standard poses. The experimental results show that the method performs well in recognizing players' poses in billiards matches and provides real-time and timely feedback on players' pose information. This research project provides a new and efficient tool for training billiard players and opens up new possibilities for applying deep learning in sports analytics. In addition, one of these contributions is the creation of a dataset for pose recognition.",

While conventional detection techniques remain widespread, they often entail laborious efforts and are susceptible to inaccuracies, underscoring the pressing need for more efficient, scalable, and immediate solutions. Our research explores the transformative capabilities of Deep Learning (DL) models, primarily focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and MobileNet architectures in the early and precise identification of plant ailments. We augmented our exploration by incorporating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through GradCAM, which elucidated the decision-making process of these models, providing a visual interpretation of disease indicators in plant images. Through rigorous testing, our CNN model yielded an accuracy of 89%, a precision and recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 96%. Conversely, the MobileNet design showcased an accuracy of 96% but recorded slightly lesser precision, recall, and F1-scores of 90%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. Such results amplify the transformative role of DL in redefining plant disease detection methodologies, presenting a formidable counterpart to conventional techniques and ushering in an era of heightened agricultural security.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe relentless evolution of machine learning technologies has led to profound advancements across diverse financial disciplines, with asset pricing emerging as a pivotal application. This research ventures into the intricate fusion of advanced deep learning methodologies within the domain of asset pricing, with a particular emphasis on enhancing risk premium measurement to facilitate a deeper understanding of financial phenomena. This study evaluates an array of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and others fortified with memory mechanisms and attention features. All these models are uniformly tested on a consistent set of predictive signals, comprising firm characteristics, systematic risks, and macroeconomic indicators. Empirical evidence gleaned from this study underscores the superior predictive capabilities of these models, with special recognition given to RNNs and Transformers equipped with memory and attention mechanisms. Concurrently, the research emphasizes the substantial economic advantages that investors can reap by deploying deep learning forecasts, thereby attesting to the instrumental role of these technologies in contemporary financial operations. Notwithstanding these technological strides, the study underscores the critical need for integrating domain-specific knowledge and financial theories into the design of these models, hence fostering a harmonious convergence between AI advancements and traditional financial acumen. Further, the research exposes unique challenges that asset return prediction tasks present to deep learning models, particularly the issue of time-varying distribution. This invariably leads to a distribution shift problem, a crucial facet for accurate financial time series prediction. Through rigorous experimentation, the study substantiates the potential of deep learning methodologies in significantly enhancing asset risk premium measurement. With the continual evolution of the deep learning field, such methodologies can consistently broaden our understanding of the underlying economic mechanisms that govern asset pricing. In conclusion, this research not only reasserts the indispensable role of deep learning in the burgeoning field of financial technology but also delineates its superior potential and advantages over traditional machine learning techniques. Such insights illuminate a path for future research, aiming to harness the power of deep learning to foster a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics that underpin asset pricing.",

DL algorithms are in the hierarchy of increasing complexity and abstraction while traditional machine learning is linear. In this study, the downscaling of the GRACE-FO satellite was investigated using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Three solutions were used for downscaling with CNN. Down-scaling accuracy is estimated to be 0.1 degree and its absolute error is 1 mm. The results show that this method can improve the GRACE-FO spatial resolution problem with higher efficiency and make it easier to analyze the results. Also, DL can solve many geodesy problems.",

The accuracy of predicting a task has tremendously improved with the implementation of deep neural networks, which in turn incorporate deep layers into the model allowing the system to learn complex data. This chapter intends to give a straightforward manual for the complexities of Google's Keras framework that is easy to understand. The basic steps for the installation of Anaconda, CUDA, along with deep learning libraries, specifically Keras and Tensorflow, are discussed. A practical approach towards solving deep learning problems in order to identify objects in CIFAR 10 dataset is explained in detail. This will help the audience in understanding deep learning through substantial practical examples to perceive algorithms instead of theory discussions. ",

        "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically trained by backpropagation in a batch setting, requiring the entire training data to be made available prior to the learning task. This is not scalable for many real-world scenarios where new data arrives sequentially in a stream. We aim to address an open challenge of ``Online Deep Learning\" (ODL) for learning DNNs on the fly in an online setting. Unlike traditional online learning that often optimizes some convex objective function with respect to a shallow model (e.g., a linear/kernel-based hypothesis), ODL is more challenging as the optimization objective is non-convex, and regular DNN with standard backpropagation does not work well in practice for online settings. We present a new ODL framework that attempts to tackle the challenges by learning DNN models which dynamically adapt depth from a sequence of training data in an online learning setting. Specifically, we propose a novel Hedge Backpropagation (HBP) method for online updating the parameters of DNN effectively, and validate the efficacy on large data sets (both stationary and concept drifting scenarios).",

More recently, these methods have been applied successfully to the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a rigorous analysis of their potential and limitations is still largely open. In this talk we will survey recent results contributing to such an analysis. In particular I will present recent empirical and theoretical results supporting the capability of Deep Learning based methods to break the curse of dimensionality for several high dimensional PDEs, including nonlinear Black Scholes equations used in computational finance, Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations used in optimal control, and stationary Schrödinger equations used in quantum chemistry. Despite these encouraging results, it is still largely unclear for which problem classes a Deep Learning based ansatz can be beneficial. To this end I will, in a second part, present recent work establishing fundamental limitations on the computational efficiency of Deep Learning based numerical algorithms that, in particular, confirm a previously empirically observed \"theory-to-practice gap\".",

Using a single machine learning classification model suffers from low prediction and classification accuracy, especially for high dimensional datasets with a high sparsity level.

In this research, we suggested two hybrid models – the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models and the Gated recurrent unit (GRU) combined with Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) – to improve traffic classification accuracy in terms of the ratio of correct predictions to total input samples. The hybrid CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU have achieved an accuracy of up to 99.23% and 93.92%, respectively, for binary classification and 67.16% for multiclass classification. We employed Markov Blanket Algorithm to make the reduced feature set selection, which significantly improved classification accuracy and fscore for multi-class scenarios.</p>",

While conventional detection techniques remain widespread, they often entail laborious efforts and are susceptible to inaccuracies, underscoring the pressing need for more efficient, scalable, and immediate solutions. Our research explores the transformative capabilities of Deep Learning (DL) models, primarily focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and MobileNet architectures in the early and precise identification of plant ailments. We augmented our exploration by incorporating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through GradCAM, which elucidated the decision-making process of these models, providing a visual interpretation of disease indicators in plant images. Through rigorous testing, our CNN model yielded an accuracy of 89%, a precision and recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 96%. Conversely, the MobileNet design showcased an accuracy of 96% but recorded slightly lesser precision, recall, and F1-scores of 90%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. Such results amplify the transformative role of DL in redefining plant disease detection methodologies, presenting a formidable counterpart to conventional techniques and ushering in an era of heightened agricultural security.",

        "abstract": "In the traditional system, a teacher observes its students' attention levels from his/her experience. To date, there is no system that automatically tracks the attention level of the students in a class in real-time (that is while the lecturer delivering his/her lectures or student watching tutorials). This paper aims at improving the lecture delivery mechanism in real-time in a classroom. On the other hand, our proposed system periodically will not only monitor the learning behaviour of the whole class but also track the attentiveness of each student. The proposed system is not meant to identify the non-attentive students and punish them. Rather contrary to the punishment based mechanism, it introduces a  counseling based mechanism. This deep learning-based real-time face monitoring system will allow lecturers to improvise his/her delivery either through bringing diversity in the class contents or personal care to those non-attentive students. The concept of deep ensemble learning has been used with convolutional neural networks to predict the percentage of openness of eyes. Separately, the positive facial postures of a student are also recognized using our model of convolutional neural network. Finally, the net learning behaviour of the student has been computed by a weighted average of these two features (that are, eyes openness and facial postures).",

Starting with the foundations of the theory and building it up, this is essential reading for any scientists, instructors, and students interested in artificial intelligence and deep learning. It provides guidance on how to think about scientific questions, and leads readers through the history of the field and its fundamental connections to neuroscience. The author discusses many applications to beautiful problems in the natural sciences, in physics, chemistry, and biomedicine. Examples include the search for exotic particles and dark matter in experimental physics, the prediction of molecular properties and reaction outcomes in chemistry, and the prediction of protein structures and the diagnostic analysis of biomedical images in the natural sciences. The text is accompanied by a full set of exercises at different difficulty levels and encourages out-of-the-box thinking.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing technologies have increased sequencing throughput by 100-1000 folds and subsequently reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to approximately US$1,000. However, the existence of sequencing artifacts can cause erroneous identification of variants and adversely impact the downstream analyses. Currently, the manual inspection of variants for additional refinement is still necessary for high-quality variant calls. The inspection is usually done on large binary alignment map (BAM) files which consume a huge amount of labor and time. It also suffers from a lack of standardization and reproducibility. Here we show that the use of mutational signatures coupled with deep learning can replace the current standards in the bioinformatics workflow. This software, called FINDEL, can efficiently remove sequencing artifacts from cancer samples. It queries the variant call format file which is much more compact than BAM files. The software automates the variant refinement process and produces high-quality variant calls.",

        "abstract": "<p>Network traffic classification is important for QoS, security, and billing. Using a single machine learning classification model suffers from low prediction and classification accuracy, especially for high dimensional datasets with a high sparsity level. Recently, hybrid-deep learning algorithms have shown high efficiency for traffic forecasting and classification. In this research, we suggested two hybrid models – the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models and the Gated recurrent unit (GRU) combined with Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) – to improve traffic classification accuracy in terms of the ratio of correct predictions to total input samples. The hybrid CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU have achieved an accuracy of up to 99.23% and 93.92%, respectively, for binary classification and 67.16% for multiclass classification. We employed Markov Blanket Algorithm to make the reduced feature set selection, which significantly improved classification accuracy and fscore for multi-class scenarios.</p>",

        "abstract": "How deep learning—from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants—is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy.\nThe deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy.\nSejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades. Sejnowski prepares us for a deep learning future.",

        "abstract": "In the past decade, deep learning has achieved a significant breakthrough in development. In addition to the emergence of convolution, the most important is self-learning of deep neural networks. By self-learning methods, adaptive weights of kernels and built-in parameters or interconnections are automatically modified such that the error rate is reduced along the learning process, and the recognition rate is improved. Emulating mechanism of the brain, it can have accurate recognition ability after learning. One of the most important self-learning methods is back-propagation (BP). The current BP method is indeed a systematic way of calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to adaptive interconnections. The main core of the gradient descent method addresses on modifying the weights negatively proportional to the determined gradient of the loss function, subsequently reducing the error of the network response in comparison with the standard answer. The basic assumption for this type of the gradient-based self-learning is that the loss function is the first-order differential. ",

        "abstract": "The classification of imbalanced datasets has recently attracted significant attention due to its implications in several real-world use cases. The classifiers developed on datasets with skewed distributions tend to favor the majority classes and are biased against the minority class. Despite extensive research interests, imbalanced data classification remains a challenge in data mining research, especially for multimedia data. Our attempt to overcome this hurdle is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning solution integrated with a bootstrapping technique. Considering that convolutional neural networks are very computationally expensive coupled with big training datasets, we propose to extract features from pre-trained convolutional neural network models and feed those features to another full connected neutral network. Spark implementation shows promising performance of our model in handling big datasets with respect to feasibility and scalability. ",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning are having a revolutionizing effect on our understanding of the Solid Earth, in particular in the automatic detection of geophysical events and objects (such as volcano movements in InSAR [Anantrasirichai et al. 2018], landslides in optical satellite imaging [Mohan et al. 2021], and earthquakes in seismic recordings [Zhu et al. 2019]). Yet, the understanding of geophysical phenomena requires us to be able to accurately characterize them: automatizing such tasks by machine learning is the new challenge for future years. One main difficulty resides in the availability of a high quality labeled database, that is a database with both input data (such as remote sensing acquisitions) together with their ground truth (what we are looking for). In this context, the problem of ground deformation estimation by sub-pixel optical satellite image registration (or correlation) is a good example.Precise estimation of ground displacement at regional scales from optical satellite imagery is fundamental for the understanding of earthquake ruptures. Current methods make use of correlation techniques between two image acquisitions in order to retrieve a fractional pixel shift [Rosu et al. 2014, Leprince et al. 2007]. However, the precision and accuracy of image correlation can be limited by various problems, such as differences in local lighting conditions between acquisitions, seasonal changes in image reflectance, stereoscopic and resampling artifacts, which can all bias the displacement estimate, especially in the sub-pixel domain.Image correlation is a valuable and unique source of information on the coseismic strain particularly in the near-field of earthquake ruptures, where InSAR can often decorrelate. However, the correlation process can be limited by the underlying assumption of a locally homogenous displacement within the correlation window (typically 3x3 to 32x32 pixels wide), leading to a bias when the correlation window crosses a fault discontinuity. Data-driven methods may provide a way to overcome these errors. Yet, no ground truth displacement field exists in real world datasets. From the generation of a realistic simulated database based on Landsat-8 satellite image pairs, with added simulated sub-pixel shifts, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) able to retrieve sub-pixel displacements. In particular, we show how to specifically design discontinuities in the training set in order to reduce the near-field bias where the correlation window crosses the fault. Comparisions are made with state-of-the-art correlations methods both on synthetic (and realistic) data, and on real images from the Ridgequest area.This preliminary study provides an example of how to use realistic synthetic data generation (combining real data with synthetic numerical approaches) for training a machine learning model able to estimate fault displacement fields. Such an approach could be applied to other characterization tasks, e.g. when realistic numerical simulation data is available, while sufficient ground truth data is not.",

Automatic realization of crop yield estimation calculation is a desired need of farmers.

To achieve the stated objectives, deep learning models have been developed that estimated yield using parameters such as the amount of water per hectare, the average amount of sunlight received by the hectare, the amount of fertilization per hectare, the number of pesticides used per hectare, and the area of cultivation. With the hybrid model created by combining the strengths of the LSTM and CNN models developed within the scope of this article, the success rate of data prediction has increased with fine adjustments. Success rates of 89.71 R2, 0.0035 MSE, 0.0248 RMSE, 0.0461 MAE, and 10.10 MAPE have been achieved with the Proposed hybrid model.

The current bottleneck in the detection of such transits is caused in large part by the presence of red (correlated) noise in the light curves obtained from the dedicated space telescopes. Based on the groundbreaking results deep learning achieves in many signal and image processing applications, we propose to use deep neural networks to solve this problem. We present a feasibility study, in which we applied a convolutional neural network on a simulated training set. The training set comprised light curves received from a hypothetical high-cadence space-based telescope. We simulated the red noise by using Gaussian Processes with a wide variety of hyper-parameters. We then tested the network on a completely different test set simulated in the same way. Our study proves that very difficult cases can indeed be detected. Furthermore, we show how detection trends can be studied and detection biases quantified. We have also checked the robustness of the neural-network performance against practical artifacts such as outliers and discontinuities, which are known to affect space-based high-cadence light curves. Future work will allow us to use the neural networks to characterize the transit model and identify individual transits. This new approach will certainly be an indispensable tool for the detection of habitable planets in the future planet-detection space missions such as PLATO.",

        "abstract": "Plant diseases have a negative impact on the agricultural sector. The diseases lower the productivity of the production yield and give huge losses to the farmers. For the betterment of agriculture, it is very essential to detect the diseases in the plants to protect the agricultural crop yield while it is also important to reduce the use of pesticides to improve the quality of the agricultural yield. Image processing and data mining algorithms together help analyze and detection of diseases. Using these techniques diseases detection can be done in rice leaves. In this research, the image processing technique is used to extract the feature from the leaf images. Further for the classification of diseases various machine learning algorithm like the random forest, J48 and support vector machine is used and the result is compared among different machine learning algorithm. After model evaluation, classification accuracy is verified using the n-fold cross-validation technique.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning are having a revolutionizing effect on our understanding of the Solid Earth, in particular in the automatic detection of geophysical events and objects (such as volcano movements in InSAR [Anantrasirichai et al. 2018], landslides in optical satellite imaging [Mohan et al. 2021], and earthquakes in seismic recordings [Zhu et al. 2019]). Yet, the understanding of geophysical phenomena requires us to be able to accurately characterize them: automatizing such tasks by machine learning is the new challenge for future years. One main difficulty resides in the availability of a high quality labeled database, that is a database with both input data (such as remote sensing acquisitions) together with their ground truth (what we are looking for). In this context, the problem of ground deformation estimation by sub-pixel optical satellite image registration (or correlation) is a good example.Precise estimation of ground displacement at regional scales from optical satellite imagery is fundamental for the understanding of earthquake ruptures. Current methods make use of correlation techniques between two image acquisitions in order to retrieve a fractional pixel shift [Rosu et al. 2014, Leprince et al. 2007]. However, the precision and accuracy of image correlation can be limited by various problems, such as differences in local lighting conditions between acquisitions, seasonal changes in image reflectance, stereoscopic and resampling artifacts, which can all bias the displacement estimate, especially in the sub-pixel domain.Image correlation is a valuable and unique source of information on the coseismic strain particularly in the near-field of earthquake ruptures, where InSAR can often decorrelate. However, the correlation process can be limited by the underlying assumption of a locally homogenous displacement within the correlation window (typically 3x3 to 32x32 pixels wide), leading to a bias when the correlation window crosses a fault discontinuity. Data-driven methods may provide a way to overcome these errors. Yet, no ground truth displacement field exists in real world datasets. From the generation of a realistic simulated database based on Landsat-8 satellite image pairs, with added simulated sub-pixel shifts, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) able to retrieve sub-pixel displacements. In particular, we show how to specifically design discontinuities in the training set in order to reduce the near-field bias where the correlation window crosses the fault. Comparisions are made with state-of-the-art correlations methods both on synthetic (and realistic) data, and on real images from the Ridgequest area.This preliminary study provides an example of how to use realistic synthetic data generation (combining real data with synthetic numerical approaches) for training a machine learning model able to estimate fault displacement fields. Such an approach could be applied to other characterization tasks, e.g. when realistic numerical simulation data is available, while sufficient ground truth data is not.",

Automatic realization of crop yield estimation calculation is a desired need of farmers. Automatic yield estimation also facilitates the work of agricultural producers with different goals such as imports and exports. To achieve the stated objectives, deep learning models have been developed that estimated yield using parameters such as the amount of water per hectare, the average amount of sunlight received by the hectare, the amount of fertilization per hectare, the number of pesticides used per hectare, and the area of cultivation. With the hybrid model created by combining the strengths of the LSTM and CNN models developed within the scope of this article, the success rate of data prediction has increased with fine adjustments. Success rates of 89.71 R2, 0.0035 MSE, 0.0248 RMSE, 0.0461 MAE, and 10.10 MAPE have been achieved with the Proposed hybrid model. This model is competitive with similar studies with the stated values.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTransits of habitable planets around solar-like stars are expected to be shallow, and to have long periods, which means low information content. The current bottleneck in the detection of such transits is caused in large part by the presence of red (correlated) noise in the light curves obtained from the dedicated space telescopes. Based on the groundbreaking results deep learning achieves in many signal and image processing applications, we propose to use deep neural networks to solve this problem. We present a feasibility study, in which we applied a convolutional neural network on a simulated training set. The training set comprised light curves received from a hypothetical high-cadence space-based telescope. We simulated the red noise by using Gaussian Processes with a wide variety of hyper-parameters. We then tested the network on a completely different test set simulated in the same way. Our study proves that very difficult cases can indeed be detected. Furthermore, we show how detection trends can be studied and detection biases quantified. We have also checked the robustness of the neural-network performance against practical artifacts such as outliers and discontinuities, which are known to affect space-based high-cadence light curves. Future work will allow us to use the neural networks to characterize the transit model and identify individual transits. This new approach will certainly be an indispensable tool for the detection of habitable planets in the future planet-detection space missions such as PLATO.",

The proposed approach involves training deep learning model Dense Net 121 to predict important crop management factors, including yield estimation, disease, and pest outbreaks. The models are trained using historical and real-time data, enabling them to adapt and respond to dynamic environmental conditions. By capturing complex patterns and interactions, deep learning models can provide valuable insights and recommendations to farmers, enabling them to optimize resource allocation, reduce input wastage, and improve overall crop productivity.",

In the distances, the influence of the distance from the camera to a face and the size of the face in the images is explored. There are 500 images collected from various videos as the input and they are applied to train the proposed models. The accuracy of face recognition from the videos excluding training dataset is at 90.18%.

The aim is to distinguish benign and malicious variants using modern deep learning methods without needing detailed functional or forensic analysis tools. One outcome of this image conversion enables contact with the vast machine learning literature already applied to handle digit recognition (MNIST). Another result indicates that greater than 90% accurate classifications prove possible using image-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) when combined with transfer learning methods. The envisioned CNN application would intercept firmware updates before their distribution to IoT networks and score their likelihood of containing malicious variants.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning heavily relies on statistical correlations to drive artificial intelligence (AI) innovations, particularly in computer vision applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, despite providing a solid foundation for deep learning, these statistical correlations can be vulnerable to unforeseen and uncontrolled factors. The lack of prior knowledge guidance can result in spurious correlations, introducing confounding factors and affecting the model's robustness. To address this challenge, recent research efforts have focused on integrating causal theory into deep learning methodologies. By modelling the inherent and unbiased causal structure, causal theory can potentially mitigate the impact of spurious correlations effectively. Hence, this paper explores the basics of causal methodologies in image classification.",

        "abstract": "This chapter introduces the idea of ‘policy myopia’ as a pressing source of failure in policy making and explores the possibility of developing policies that learn to help mitigate its impacts. It notes that while the problem of bounded rationality and short-term uncertainty is widely acknowledged as the central existential condition for all policy making, the long-term problem of an uncertain, and sometimes unknowable, future is rarely acknowledged. As uncertainty deepens, so too does the probability of policy failure. In these circumstances, actors need to design policies with flexibility and adaptation built in. Where policy solutions are robust over a range of possible scenarios and over time, one can say policies have learning capacity organised into them. Yet, in cases of radical uncertainty, learning may not be possible (or indeed preferable) at all. This reminder of the limits of learning is important. Updating one's belief systems assumes that a certain amount of knowledge exists in the first place.",

Recent development in deep learning provides various significant methods to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. Generative Adversarial Networks give the idea of learning the deep representations without extensively interpreting the training data. The generative adversarial network involves the generative modeling approach that uses the deep learning approach. The chapter is broadly divided into the following sections as (1) Insights of deep learning &amp; the generative adversarial networks, (2) GAN’s representative variants, training methods, architecture, and mathematical representation, and (3) Efficacy of GAN in different applications. This chapter will gain the recent work done in GAN and implement this technique in the different deep learning applications for healthcare. Here, we will also analyze some of the future perspectives and trends in the forthcoming time.<br>",

This chapter addresses the problem of employing deep learning algorithms in Big Data analytics. Unlike the traditional algorithms, this chapter comes up with various solutions to employ advanced deep learning mechanisms with less complexity and finally present a generic solution. The deep learning algorithms require less time to process the big amount of data based on different contexts. However, collecting the accurate feature and classifying the context into patterns using neural networks algorithms require high time and complexity. Therefore, using deep learning algorithms in integration with neural networks can bring optimize solutions. Consequently, the aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of how the advance deep learning algorithms can be used to solve various existing challenges in Big Data analytics.",

        "abstract": "Abstract2′-O-methylation (2′O) is one of the abundant post-transcriptional RNA modifications which can be found in all types of RNA. Detection and functional analysis of 2′O methylation have become challenging problems for biologists ever since its discovery. This paper addresses computational challenges for building Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for predicting 2′O sites. In particular, the impact of sequence length containing 2′O site, embedding method and the type of predictive model are each investigated separately. 30 different predictive models are built and each showed the impact of the mentioned parameters. The area under the precision-recall and receiving operating characteristics curves are utilized to test imbalanced case scenarios in the real world. By comparing the performance of these models, it is shown that embedding methods are crucial for Machine Learning models. However, they do not improve the performance of Deep Learning models. Furthermore, the best predictive model was further investigated to extract significant nucleotides surrounding 2′O sites. Interestingly, based on the significant score matrix achieved by all 2′O samples, it is depicted that model pays the highest attention at the location that the dominant 2′O motifs exist. Dataset and all of the codes are available at https://github.com/MMostavi/2_O_Me_sitePred",

We will talk about the hardware and software used in the project and how they work, in order to explain to the ordinary reader how some technical matters are done and to explain to the specialist some things that he or she might consider while developing. In our project, samples are the cornerstone of the project, and for this, we have focused on them in the report, from the methods of identifying samples to access to taking samples and analyzing them project to other dimensions. When we wrote the project, we took into account that development on the project is an important part of this academic process, so we paved the way for those who want to develop by collecting our own database in Arabic for scientific purposes so that development on it becomes easier and more productive.",

        "abstract": "A malicious firmware update may prove devastating to the embedded devices both that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) and alsothat typically lack the same security verifications now applied to full operating systems. This work converts the binary headers of 40,000 firmware examples from bytes into 1024-pixel thumbnail images to train a deep neural network. The aim is to distinguish benign and malicious variants using modern deep learning methods without needing detailed functional or forensic analysis tools. One outcome of this image conversion enables contact with the vast machine learning literature already applied to handle digit recognition (MNIST). Another result indicates that greater than 90% accurate classifications prove possible using image-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) when combined with transfer learning methods. The envisioned CNN application would intercept firmware updates before their distribution to IoT networks and score their likelihood of containing malicious variants.",

In view of the existing problem, this paper presents a state-of-the-art survey on an intelligent robot with the capability of autonomous deciding and learning. The paper first reviews the main achievements and research of the robot, which were mainly based on the breakthrough of automatic control and hardware in mechanics. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, many pieces of research have made further progresses in adaptive and robust control. The survey reveals that the latest research in deep learning and reinforcement learning has paved the way for highly complex tasks to be performed by robots. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and transfer learning in robot control are discussed in detail. Finally, major achievements based on these methods are summarized and analyzed thoroughly, and future research challenges are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a\nlong time. While supporters of the <i>efficient market hypothesis</i> believe\nthat it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions\ndemonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may\nlead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be\nvery accurately predicted. Researchers have also worked on technical analysis\nof stocks with a goal of identifying patterns in the stock price movements\nusing advanced data mining techniques. In this work, we propose an approach of\nhybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning\nand deep learning-based models. For the purpose of our study, we have used NIFTY\n50 index values of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, during the period\nDecember 29, 2014 till July 31, 2020.  We\nhave built eight regression models using the training data that consisted of\nNIFTY 50 index records from December 29, 2014 till December 28, 2018. Using\nthese regression models, we predicted the <i>open</i> values of NIFTY 50 for\nthe period December 31, 2018 till July 31, 2020. We, then, augment the\npredictive power of our forecasting framework by building four deep\nlearning-based regression models using long-and short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks with a novel approach of walk-forward validation. Using the grid-searching\ntechnique, the hyperparameters of the LSTM models are optimized so that it is\nensured that validation losses stabilize with the increasing number of epochs,\nand the convergence of the validation accuracy is achieved. We exploit the\npower of LSTM regression models in forecasting the future NIFTY 50 <i>open</i>\nvalues using four different models that differ in their architecture and in the\nstructure of their input data. Extensive results are presented on various\nmetrics for all the regression models. The results clearly indicate that the\nLSTM-based univariate model that uses one-week prior data as input for\npredicting the next week's <i>open</i> value of the NIFTY 50 time series is the\nmost accurate model.",

The accurate and clinical staging of lung cancer category can effectively reduce the death rate, since the treatment phase requires the specific stage of cancer. However, the staging of lung cancer still remains challenging, requires more efforts. The Computed Tomography images (CT) images are utilized for the Computer Aided Diagnosis based cancer diagnosis. With that note, this paper develops a Volumetric Analysis for Lung Tumor Staging and Classification (VA-LTSC), in which the stages are classified based on Tumor Nodule Metastasis (TNM) with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models Moreover, the proposed model comprises different phases. The results are measured using inputs from LIDC-IDRI and LUNA 16, based on classification accuracy, model effectiveness and time complexities and in all, the proposed model outperforms the existing results.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created a synthetic dataset based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar highly depends on the nature of the prediction task.",

This chapter addresses the problem of employing deep learning algorithms in Big Data analytics. Unlike the traditional algorithms, this chapter comes up with various solutions to employ advanced deep learning mechanisms with less complexity and finally present a generic solution. The deep learning algorithms require less time to process the big amount of data based on different contexts. However, collecting the accurate feature and classifying the context into patterns using neural networks algorithms require high time and complexity. Therefore, using deep learning algorithms in integration with neural networks can bring optimize solutions. Consequently, the aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of how the advance deep learning algorithms can be used to solve various existing challenges in Big Data analytics.",

        "abstract": "Fungal diseases in plants are extremely pressing issues in the agricultural industry, threatening global food security by reducing crop yields and quality. Traditional approaches to disease diagnosis and management have failed to recognize symptoms when they first appear. Leaves of the turnip, a plant of high agricultural value, has been especially affected by the fungal disease Anthracnose. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel convolutional neural network that can identify turnip leaves with early symptoms of Anathrosce blight. The model had 4 convolutional blocks and was trained on a custom dataset of 1,470 images, randomly split into 60% train, 20% validation, and 20% test. To compare how the CNN model fared with other machine learning algorithms, a support vector machine(SVM) model was developed and trained with the same image dataset. The CNN model’s accuracy 98.75% compared to the SVM model’s 80.50% accuracy. These results validate the efficacy of the CNN model to accurately identify infected turnip leaves and demonstrate that it can be implemented into a practical disease diagnosis system. Future studies are warranted to improve the model through means such as k-fold cross validation as well as apply the model architecture to other crops and diseases.",

        "abstract": "In lunar exploration missions, the detection of lunar craters is essential for scientific inquiry, navigation, and terrain analysis. Conventional approaches for identifying craters depend on labor- and time-intensive manual inspection or semi-automated procedures. An effective and precise way to automate this procedure is through the use of deep learning algorithms. In this brief message, we introduce our implementation of the cutting-edge object detection method, YOLOv8, for the purpose of detecting lunar craters. The YOLOv8 architecture, which is well-known for its quickness and precision in object identification tasks, was employed. YOLO (You Only Look Once) predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for several items in an image at once using a single neural network. We used a dataset of high-resolution lunar surface photos with crater annotations to train the YOLOv8 model.",

        "abstract": "Livestock management is a critical issue for the farming industry as proper management including their health and well-being directly impacts the production. It is difficult for a farmer or shed owner to monitor big herds of cattle manually. This chapter proposes a layered framework that utilizes the power of internet of things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) to real-time livestock monitoring supporting the effective management of cattle. The framework consists of sensor layer where sensor-rich devices or gadgets are used to collect various contextual data related to livestock, data processing layer which deals with various outlier rejections and processing of the data followed by DL approaches to analyze the collected contextual data in detecting sick and on heat animals, and finally, insightful information is sent to shed owner for necessary action. An experimental study conducted is helpful to make wise decisions to increase production cost-effectively. The chapter concludes with the different future aspects that may be further explored by the researchers. ",

        "abstract": "At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, naïve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMulti-task deep learning (DL) models can accurately predict diverse genomic marks from sequence, but whether these models learn the causal relationships between genomic marks is unknown. Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian Randomization with in silico mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the ‘true’ global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet [Avsec et al., 2020], between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR’s causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.",

        "abstract": "The Science of Deep Learning emerged from courses taught by the author that have provided thousands of students with training and experience for their academic studies, and prepared them for careers in deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in top companies in industry and academia. The book begins by covering the foundations of deep learning, followed by key deep learning architectures. Subsequent parts on generative models and reinforcement learning may be used as part of a deep learning course or as part of a course on each topic. The book includes state-of-the-art topics such as Transformers, graph neural networks, variational autoencoders, and deep reinforcement learning, with a broad range of applications. The appendices provide equations for computing gradients in backpropagation and optimization, and best practices in scientific writing and reviewing. The text presents an up-to-date guide to the field built upon clear visualizations using a unified notation and equations, lowering the barrier to entry for the reader. The accompanying website provides complementary code and hundreds of exercises with solutions.",

        "abstract": "Several recent studies have shown action recognition to be a popular research topic. Traditionalapproaches have been surpassed by using deep learning approaches. For a more robust recognition,multimodal action recognition systems combine numerous picture modalities (RGB, Depth,Skeleton, and InfraRed). We can distinguish three families of approaches based on the fusion levelin the action recognition pipeline: early fusion, in which the raw modalities are combined beforefeature extraction; intermediate fusion, in which the features for each modality are concatenatedbefore classification; and late fusion, in which the modality-wise classification results arecombined. After analysing the literature, we found the major flaws in each category, which weattempt to overcome by focusing on early-stage fusion, which has received little attention in theliterature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSign language is a method of communication that uses hand gestures and movements rather than words. It is mostly used by Deaf or hearing-impaired individuals. The paper discusses the process of using the hand gestures for Gesture Recognition Based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this a custom CNN model of five layers is built from the scratch and trained over 2400 images of hand gestures to identify 26 alphabets and 10 numerical from 0 to 9. The diversity and complexity of gestures, on the other hand, have a significant influence on gesture recognition owing to the surroundings, light source, cover, and other considerations. To improve the characteristics of gesture identification, the hand skin color is filtered through the YCbCr color space to segregate the gesture region to be identified, and the noise of the gesture edge is processed using the Gaussian filter. Another task of Speech recognition, often known as speech-to-text, refers to a machine’s or program’s capacity to recognise and transform spoken words into legible text. The vocabulary of rudimentary voice recognition software is restricted, and it can only recognise words and sentences uttered clearly. The paper also discusses the neural networks’ pattern matching ability on audio signals for the speech recognition process. In this an audio is generated and recognised using speech recognition google API which results in text processing using NLP. As a result a GIF or hand gestures are output on the screen corresponding to the audio.",

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) in recent decades are extensively using these technological tools, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). In this paper, two of the main methods of these subset of AI are compared: an ensemble-type algorithm, XGBoost (or Extreme Gradient Boosting) and a deep neural network (DNN) are applied to the data of a study conducted on an Indonesian population. The results obtained are very interesting as despite being tabular, binary categorical and multiclass data, the DNN model achieves performance and results much higher than the well-known XGB used in literature for data of this type.",

        "abstract": "Image segmentation is widely used in a variety of computer vision tasks, such as object localization and recognition, boundary detection, and medical imaging. This thesis proposes deep learning architectures to improve automatic object localization and boundary delineation for salient object segmentation in natural images and for 2D medical image segmentation. First, we propose and evaluate a novel dilated dense encoder-decoder architecture with a custom dilated spatial pyramid pooling block to accurately localize and delineate boundaries for salient object segmentation. The dilation offers better spatial understanding and the dense connectivity preserves features learned at shallower levels of the network for better localization. Tested on three publicly available datasets, our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art for one and is very competitive on the other two. Second, we propose and evaluate a custom 2D dilated dense UNet architecture for accurate lesion localization and segmentation in medical images. This architecture can be utilized as a stand alone segmentation framework or used as a rich feature extracting backbone to aid other models in medical image segmentation. Our architecture outperforms all baseline models for accurate lesion localization and segmentation on a new dataset. We furthermore explore the main considerations that should be taken into account for 3D medical image segmentation, among them preprocessing techniques and specialized loss functions.",

        "abstract": "<p>Convolutional neural networks have been asserted to be fast and precise frameworks with great potential in image segmentation. Within the medical domain, image segmentation is a pre-cursor to several applications including surgical simulations, treatment planning and patient prognosis. In this thesis, we attempt to solve two major limitations of current segmentation practices: 1) dealing with unbalanced classes and 2) dealing with multiple modalities. In medical imaging, unbalanced classes present as the regions of interest that are typically significantly smaller in volume than the background class or other classes. We propose an improvement to the current gold standard cost function to boost the focus of the network to the smaller classes. Another problem within medical imaging is the variation in both anatomy and pathology across patients. Utilizing multiple imaging modalities provides complementary, segmentation-specific information and is commonly employed by radiologists when contouring data. We propose a image fusion strategy for multi-modal data that uses the variation in modality specific features to guide the task specific learning. Together, our contributions propose a framework to maximize the representational power of the dataset using models with less complexity and higher generalizability. Our contributions outperform baseline models for multi-class segmentation and are modular enough to be scaled up to deeper networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cost function and multimodal framework, both individually and together, on benchmark datasets including the Breast Ultrasound Dataset B (BUS) [1], the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC 2018) [2], [3] and the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTs 2018) [4]. In all experiments, the proposed methods match or outperform the baseline methods while employing simpler networks</p>",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, natural language understanding, speech recognition, information retrieval, and more. However, with the progressive improvements in deep learning models, their number of parameters, latency, and resources required to train, among others, have all increased significantly. Consequently, it has become important to pay attention to these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We present and motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thorough survey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modeling techniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We also present an experiment-based guide along with code for practitioners to optimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers the landscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. It is our hope that this survey would provide readers with the mental model and the necessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques to immediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas for further research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.",

        "authors": "Patrice Carbonneau",
        "published": "No Date",
        "citations": 0,
        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Semantic image classification as practised in Earth Observation is poorly suited to mapping fluvial landforms which are often composed of multiple landcover types such as water, riparian vegetation and exposed sediment. Deep learning methods developed in the field of computer vision for the purpose of image classification (ie the attribution of a single label to an image such as cat/dog/etc) are in fact more suited to such landform mapping tasks. Notably, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have excelled at the task of labelling images. However, CNN are notorious for requiring very large training sets that are laborious and costly to assemble. Similarity learning is a sub-field of deep learning and is better known for one-shot and few-shot learning methods. These approaches aim to reduce the need for large training sets by using CNN architectures to compare a single, or few, known examples of an instance to a new image and determining if the new image is similar to the provided examples. Similarity learning rests on the concept of image embeddings which are condensed higher-dimension vector representations of an image generated by a CNN. Ideally, and if a CNN is suitably trained, image embeddings will form clusters according to image classes, even if some of these classes were never used in the initial CNN training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we use similarity learning for the purpose of fluvial landform mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery. We use the True Color Image product with a spatial resolution of 10 meters and begin by manually extracting tiles of 128x128 pixels for 4 classes: non-river, meandering reaches, anastomosing reaches and braiding reaches. We use the DenseNet121 CNN topped with a densely connected layer of 8 nodes which will produce embeddings as 8-dimension vectors. We then train this network with only 3 classes (non-river, meandering and anastomosing) using a categorical cross-entropy loss function. Our first result is that when applied to our image tiles, the embeddings produced by the trained CNN deliver 4 clusters. Despite not being used in the network training, the braiding river reach tiles have produced embeddings that form a distinct cluster. We then use this CNN to perform few-shot learning with a Siamese triplet architecture that will classify a new tile based on only 3 examples of each class. Here we find that tiles from the non-river, meandering and anastomising class were classified with F1 scores of 72%, 87% and 84%, respectively. The braiding river tiles were classified to an F1 score of 80%. Whilst these performances are lesser than the 90%+ performances expected from conventional CNN, the prediction of a new class of objects (braiding reaches) with only 3 samples to 80% F1 is unprecedented in river remote sensing. We will conclude the paper by extending the method to mapping fluvial landforms on entire Sentinel-2 tiles and we will show how we can use advanced cluster analyses of image embeddings to identify landform classes in an image without making a priori decisions on the classes that are present in the image.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "In this work we conduct a thorough examination of utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques for classifying meteors based on their characteristics. The focus of the research is the analysis of light curves emitted by meteors as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere, including aspects such as luminosity, duration, and shape. Through extracting features from these light curves and comparing them to established meteors orbits, valuable information about the meteor&#8217;s origin and chemical makeup is sought to be obtained. A significant contribution of the thesis is the development of methods for classifying meteors by extracting features from the light curve shape through the usage of unsupervised classification algorithms. This approach allows for the automatic classification of meteors into various groups based on their properties, obviating the need for manual annotation. Data for the research is collected by a three-camera setup at the Armagh observatory, comprising one medium-angle camera and two wide-angle cameras. This setup enables the capturing of detailed images of meteor light curves, as well as various other observations such as coordinate and angular data. The research also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for data reduction and classification tasks. By applying these techniques to the data collected from the camera setup, the identification of parent objects based on chemical composition and meteor path is facilitated, along with the acquisition of other valuable information about the meteors. In summary, the findings of the research should demonstrate the potential of utilizing machine learning and computer vision methods in the study of meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere. The results contribute to a more profound understanding of the properties and origins of meteors and hold the potential to inform future research in this field.",

The early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer are made possible by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems that rely on mammograms. This study introduces a unique deep-learning model that uses transfer learning to identify and categorize breast cancer automatically. Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown in several recent studies to diagnose breast cancer in mammograms with performance comparable to or even outperforming that of human experts. In order to extract features from the dataset from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS), the proposed model uses pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like ResNet50 and Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG)-16. This novel deep-learning model holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of breast cancer detection and classification.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTGenomic predictions have been recognized as a new promising technique in animal and plant breeding. Linear mixed model is a widely used statistical technique, but it may not be desirable for large training sets and number of molecular markers, because it is intensive in computation. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and it can be used for complex predictions on a large scale. Multi task deep learning (MT-DL) incorporates related tasks(labels or traits) into one learning process to enable the learning model to perform better than single task deep learning (ST-DL). I applied MT-DL to genotype by environment genomic predictions to predict the performances of breeding lines at multiple environments. I compared MT-DL with linear mixed model-based Bayesian genotype × environment method (BGGE) and separate genomic predictions on single environments with widely used rrBLUP, ridge regression and ST-DL using cross validations. Compared with rrBLUP, MT-DL and non-linear BGGE showed a moderate increase of 9.4 and 7.6%, respectively, ST-DL has a small increase of 5.4%, ridge regression had a similar prediction accuracy and linear BGGE had a small decrease of −2.0% for prediction accuracy. I also found that all methods including rrBLUP had an overfitting, this is likely because yield genomic predictions are complex and the data set used in this study are small. rrBLUP, ridge regression, ST-DL and MT-DL has similar overfitting. Difference between training and test set prediction accuracies was between 0.344 and 0. 387. Linear and nonlinear BGGE methods seem to have much worse overfitting than other methods. Difference between training and test set prediction accuracies were 0.429 and 0.472, respectively. I also discussed the potential applications of ST-DL and MT-DL in genomic predictions of hybrid crops such as maize",

The parameters span a wide range from effective temperature to rotational velocity. We propose to estimate the stellar parameters directly from spectral signals coming from the HARPS-N spectrograph pipeline before any spectrum-processing steps are applied to extract the 1D spectrum. We propose an attention-based model to estimate the stellar parameters, which estimate both mean and uncertainty of the stellar parameters through estimation of the parameters of a Gaussian distribution. The estimated distributions create a basis to generate data-driven Gaussian confidence intervals for the estimated stellar parameters. We show that residual networks and attention-based models can estimate the stellar parameters with high accuracy for low Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to previous methods. With an observation of the Sun from the HARPS-N spectrograph, we show that the models can estimate stellar parameters from real observational data.",

Deep learning algorithms are one of the promising researches for automation of complex data extraction from large data sets. Deep learning mechanisms produce better results in machine learning, such as computer vision, improved classification modelling, probabilistic models of data samples, and invariant data sets. The challenges handled by the big data are fast information retrieval, semantic indexing, extracting complex patterns, and data tagging. Some investigations are concentrated on integration of deep learning approaches with big data analytics which pose some severe challenges like scalability, high dimensionality, data streaming, and distributed computing. Finally, the chapter concludes by posing some questions to develop the future work in semantic indexing, active learning, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation modelling, data sampling, and data abstractions.

        "abstract": "Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a\nlong time. While supporters of the <i>efficient market hypothesis</i> believe\nthat it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions\ndemonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may\nlead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be\nvery accurately predicted. Researchers have also worked on technical analysis\nof stocks with a goal of identifying patterns in the stock price movements\nusing advanced data mining techniques. In this work, we propose an approach of\nhybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning\nand deep learning-based models. For the purpose of our study, we have used NIFTY\n50 index values of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, during the period\nDecember 29, 2014 till July 31, 2020.  We\nhave built eight regression models using the training data that consisted of\nNIFTY 50 index records from December 29, 2014 till December 28, 2018. Using\nthese regression models, we predicted the <i>open</i> values of NIFTY 50 for\nthe period December 31, 2018 till July 31, 2020. We, then, augment the\npredictive power of our forecasting framework by building four deep\nlearning-based regression models using long-and short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks with a novel approach of walk-forward validation. Using the grid-searching\ntechnique, the hyperparameters of the LSTM models are optimized so that it is\nensured that validation losses stabilize with the increasing number of epochs,\nand the convergence of the validation accuracy is achieved. We exploit the\npower of LSTM regression models in forecasting the future NIFTY 50 <i>open</i>\nvalues using four different models that differ in their architecture and in the\nstructure of their input data. Extensive results are presented on various\nmetrics for all the regression models. The results clearly indicate that the\nLSTM-based univariate model that uses one-week prior data as input for\npredicting the next week's <i>open</i> value of the NIFTY 50 time series is the\nmost accurate model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in identifying gene regulatory sequences, but they have provided limited insight into the biology of regulatory elements due to the difficulty of interpreting the complex features they learn. Several models of how combinatorial binding of transcription factors, i.e. the regulatory grammar, drives enhancer activity have been proposed, ranging from the flexible TF billboard model to the stringent enhanceosome model. However, there is limited knowledge of the prevalence of these (or other) sequence architectures across enhancers. Here we perform several hypothesis-driven analyses to explore the ability of DNNs to learn the regulatory grammar of enhancers. We created a synthetic dataset based on existing hypotheses about combinatorial transcription factor binding site (TFBS) patterns, including homotypic clusters, heterotypic clusters, and enhanceosomes, from real TF binding motifs from diverse TF families. We then trained deep residual neural networks (ResNets) to model the sequences under a range of scenarios that reflect real-world multi-label regulatory sequence prediction tasks. We developed a gradient-based unsupervised clustering method to extract the patterns learned by the ResNet models. We demonstrated that simulated regulatory grammars are best learned in the penultimate layer of the ResNets, and the proposed method can accurately retrieve the regulatory grammar even when there is heterogeneity in the enhancer categories and a large fraction of TFBS outside of the regulatory grammar. However, we also identify common scenarios where ResNets fail to learn simulated regulatory grammars. Our results provide a framework for interpreting the regulatory rules learned by ResNets, and they demonstrate that the ability and efficiency of ResNets in learning the regulatory grammar highly depends on the nature of the prediction task.",

Although much research has been carried out on crowd analytics, many of existing methods are problem-specific, i.e., methods learned from a specific scene cannot be properly adopted to other videos. Therefore, this presents weakness and the discovery of these researches, since additional training samples have to be found from diverse videos. This paper will investigate diverse scene crowd analytics with traditional and deep learning models. We will also consider pros and cons of these approaches. However, once general deep methods are investigated from large datasets, they can be consider to investigate different crowd videos and images. Therefore, it would be able to cope with the problem including to not limited to crowd density estimation, crowd people counting, and crowd event recognition. Deep learning models and approaches are required to have large datasets for training and testing. Many datasets are collected taking into account many different and various problems related to building crowd datasets, including manual annotations and increasing diversity of videos and images. In this paper, we will also propose many models of deep neural networks and training approaches to learn the feature modeling for crowd analytics.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have been shown to be able to make competitive forecasts of El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In most cases, due to the short observational record, the outputs of global circulation models (GCM) are used to train DL models. However, GCMs themselves show biases when modeling ENSO dynamics, such as the lack of phase-locking behavior, shifted precipitation trends, or missing El Ni&#241;o - La Ni&#241;a asymmetry. The biases of the GCMs are likely inherited by the DL models during pre-training, raising the question of how we can obtain unbiased DL ENSO models while pre-training on GCM output. In this study, we contend that a possible solution to correct these biases is to use well-established domain adaptation methods, which allow DL models to account for shifts in data distribution between training and validation data sets. In particular, we use a ConvLSTM network trained on CESM2 simulations where we first use a supervised objective to fine-tune our model to reanalysis data. Secondly, we employ test-time training to adapt our model for the domain shift between CESM2 and reanalysis data. This study serves as a first step toward comparing domain adaptation techniques for data-driven seasonal-to-annual DL models in a limited data regime.",

        "abstract": "Particularly inside the context of deep learning, the concept of interpretability in artificial intelligence systems is crucial for boosting the degree of trust and self-belief that human beings have in machine-learning fashions. Deep learning models have many parameters and complex architectures that make them function like mysterious “black boxes,” making it difficult for users to apprehend how they function. This opacity increases questions about those models' ethics, dependability, and viable biases. In the field of deep learning, achieving interpretability is crucial for several reasons. First off, interpretable models enhance transparency by making the model's judgments and forecasts simpler for customers to understand. This is particularly essential in complicated fields like banking and healthcare, wherein knowledge and self-assurance are vital. Moreover, interpretability facilitates the identification and correction of biases in the model or the training statistics, performing as a car for fairness and duty.",

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is currently applied to different sorts of problems that were previously obstinate. In this chapter, at first, the authors started with an introduction of the general field of RL and Markov decision process (MDP). Then, they clarified the common DRL framework and the necessary components RL settings. Moreover, they analyzed the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based optimizers such as ADAM and a non-specific multi-policy selection mechanism in a multi-objective Markov decision process. In this chapter, the authors also included the comparison for different Deep Q networks. In conclusion, they describe several challenges and trends in research within the deep reinforcement learning field. ",

        "abstract": "The current era has been filled with the data and information, crawling around the web and being utilized in the best way to produce smartness. The same concept has been used for developing smart cities by increasingly deploying IoT sensor devices to collect the data from various fields. There are numerous opportunities in these fields that are related to streaming IoT data, cloud service, computer vision, and machine learning. Simultaneously, there are lots of challenges while implementing the solutions at various locations. This chapter highlights various challenges and opportunities in electricity meter consumption and billing. In this chapter, a Python-based model has been proposed for smart electricity meter for taking the reading from commercial/residential meters and producing the electricity bills smartly. Challenges for the customers will be handled by frequently monitoring the reading from the meters and reporting issues if any directly to the concerned authority. This will definitely help specially the commercial consumers to rectify their issues. ",

        "abstract": "Arguably the human body has been one of the most sophisticated systems we encounter but until now we are still far from understanding its complexity. We have been trying to replicate human intelligence by way of artificial intelligence but with limited success. We have discovered the molecular structure in terms of genetics, performed gene editing to change an organism’s DNA and much more, but their translatability into the field of oncology has remained limited. Conventional machine learning methods achieved some degree of success in solving problems that we do not have an explicit algorithm. However, they are basically shallow learning methods, not rich enough to discover and extract intricate features that represent patterns in the real environment. Deep learning has exceeded human performance in pattern recognition as well as strategic games and are powerful for dealing with many complex problems. High-throughput sequencing and microarray techniques have generated vast amounts of data and allowed the comprehensive study of gene expression in tumor cells. The application of deep learning with molecular data enables applications in oncology with information not available from clinical diagnosis. This paper provides fundamental concepts of deep learning, an essential knowledge of cancer genetics, and a review of applications of deep learning to cancer oncology. Importantly, it provides an insightful knowledge of deep learning and an extensive discussion on its challenges. The ultimate purpose is to germinate ideas and facilitate collaborations between cancer biologists and deep learning researchers to address challenging oncological problems using advanced deep learning technologies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is a severe health issue that affects women all over the world, underscoring the need for reliable and effective screening techniques. The early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer are made possible by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems that rely on mammograms. This study introduces a unique deep-learning model that uses transfer learning to identify and categorize breast cancer automatically. Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown in several recent studies to diagnose breast cancer in mammograms with performance comparable to or even outperforming that of human experts. To extract attributes from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset, the proposed model uses pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like ResNet50 and Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG)-16. This novel deep-learning model holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of breast cancer detection and classification. A preprint has previously been published [1]",

        "abstract": "At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, naïve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advancement in computer vision research based on deep learning. Success of these tasks largely depends on the availability of a large amount of training samples. Labeling the training samples is an expensive process. In this paper, we present a simulated deep convolutional neural network for yield estimation. Knowing the exact number of fruits, flowers, and trees helps farmers to make better decisions on cultivation practices, plant disease prevention, and the size of harvest labor force. The current practice of yield estimation based on the manual counting of fruits or flowers by workers is a very time consuming and expensive process and it is not practical for big fields. Automatic yield estimation based on robotic agriculture provides a viable solution in this regard. Our network is trained entirely on synthetic data and tested on real data. To capture features on multiple scales, we used a modified version of the Inception-ResNet architecture. Our algorithm counts efficiently even if fruits are under shadow, occluded by foliage, branches, or if there is some degree of overlap amongst fruits. Experimental results show a 91% average test accuracy on real images and 93% on synthetic images.",

        "abstract": "AbstractFunctional ultrasound (fUS) is a rapidly emerging modality that enables whole-brain imaging of neural activity in awake and mobile rodents. To achieve sufficient blood flow sensitivity in the brain microvasculature, fUS relies on long ultrasound data acquisitions at high frame rates, posing high demands on the sampling and processing hardware. Here we develop an end-to-end image reconstruction approach based on deep learning that significantly reduces the amount of data necessary while retaining the imaging performance. We trained a convolutional neural network to learn the power Doppler reconstruction function from sparse sequences of ultrasound data with a compression factor up to 95%, using high-quality images from in vivo acquisitions in rats. We tested the imaging performance in a functional neuroimaging application. We demonstrate that time series of power Doppler images can be reconstructed with sufficient accuracy to detect the small changes in cerebral blood volume (~10%) characteristic of task-evoked cortical activation, even though the network was not formally trained to reconstruct such image series. The proposed platform may facilitate the development of this neuroimaging modality in any setting where dedicated hardware is not available or in clinical scanners.",

Understanding the recognition of the materials in different images that involve a deep learn-ing process made use of the recent development in the field of Artificial Neural Networks broughtthe ability to train various neural network architectures for the extraction of features for this chal-lenging task. In this work, state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques areused to classify materials and also compare the results obtained by them.The results are gath-ered over two material data sets applying the two popular approaches of Transfer Learning. Theresults showcase that fine-tuning approach achieves very good results compared to the case of ap-proach when the information derived from the layer which is just before the fully connected layeris limited. The results of the comparison indicates the fact that there is an improvement in theperformance and the accuracy of the system particularly in the data set that contains large numberof images.",

        "abstract": "AbstractData from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate a worldwide occurrence of 2 to 3 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer annually. The American Cancer Society estimates that the incidence reaches 5.4 million in the United States alone. In cases of fatal diseases, early detection received great attention from the population and the media due to the premise that the earlier a cancer is identified, the greater the chances of cure. It is to be believed that the application of automated methods will help in early diagnosis, especially with the set of images with a variety of diagnoses. Thus, this article presents a system for recognizing dermatological diseases through images with lesions, a machine intervention in contrast to conventional detection based on medical personnel. Our model is designed in three phases, committing to data collection and augmentation, model development, and finally, prediction. We used various AI algorithms such as ANN with image processing tools to form a better structure, leading to higher accuracy of 89%.Contactdheiver.santos@ictbridge.org, dheiver.santos@gmail.com",

        "abstract": "In training a deep learning system to perform audio transcription, two practical problems may arise. Firstly, most datasets are weakly labelled, having only a list of events present in each recording without any temporal information for training. Secondly, deep neural networks need a very large amount of labelled training data to achieve good quality performance, yet in practice it is difficult to collect enough samples for most classes of interest. In this paper, we propose factorising the final task of audio transcription into multiple intermediate tasks in order to improve the training performance when dealing with this kind of low-resource datasets. We evaluate three data-efficient approaches of training a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network for the intermediate tasks. Our results show that different methods of training have different advantages and disadvantages.",

This number only addresses direct economic losses to buildings, and does not cover damage and losses to critical facilities, transportation and utility lifelines or indirect economic losses.

        "authors": "Patrice Carbonneau",
        "published": "No Date",
        "citations": 0,
        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Semantic image classification as practised in Earth Observation is poorly suited to mapping fluvial landforms which are often composed of multiple landcover types such as water, riparian vegetation and exposed sediment. Deep learning methods developed in the field of computer vision for the purpose of image classification (ie the attribution of a single label to an image such as cat/dog/etc) are in fact more suited to such landform mapping tasks. Notably, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have excelled at the task of labelling images. However, CNN are notorious for requiring very large training sets that are laborious and costly to assemble. Similarity learning is a sub-field of deep learning and is better known for one-shot and few-shot learning methods. These approaches aim to reduce the need for large training sets by using CNN architectures to compare a single, or few, known examples of an instance to a new image and determining if the new image is similar to the provided examples. Similarity learning rests on the concept of image embeddings which are condensed higher-dimension vector representations of an image generated by a CNN. Ideally, and if a CNN is suitably trained, image embeddings will form clusters according to image classes, even if some of these classes were never used in the initial CNN training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we use similarity learning for the purpose of fluvial landform mapping from Sentinel-2 imagery. We use the True Color Image product with a spatial resolution of 10 meters and begin by manually extracting tiles of 128x128 pixels for 4 classes: non-river, meandering reaches, anastomosing reaches and braiding reaches. We use the DenseNet121 CNN topped with a densely connected layer of 8 nodes which will produce embeddings as 8-dimension vectors. We then train this network with only 3 classes (non-river, meandering and anastomosing) using a categorical cross-entropy loss function. Our first result is that when applied to our image tiles, the embeddings produced by the trained CNN deliver 4 clusters. Despite not being used in the network training, the braiding river reach tiles have produced embeddings that form a distinct cluster. We then use this CNN to perform few-shot learning with a Siamese triplet architecture that will classify a new tile based on only 3 examples of each class. Here we find that tiles from the non-river, meandering and anastomising class were classified with F1 scores of 72%, 87% and 84%, respectively. The braiding river tiles were classified to an F1 score of 80%. Whilst these performances are lesser than the 90%+ performances expected from conventional CNN, the prediction of a new class of objects (braiding reaches) with only 3 samples to 80% F1 is unprecedented in river remote sensing. We will conclude the paper by extending the method to mapping fluvial landforms on entire Sentinel-2 tiles and we will show how we can use advanced cluster analyses of image embeddings to identify landform classes in an image without making a priori decisions on the classes that are present in the image.&lt;/p&gt;",

The identification and characterization of Regions of Interest (ROIs) containing lesions is an important phase allowing an easier classification in two classes of HCCs. Two steps are needed for the detection of lesioned ROIs: a liver isolation in each CT slice and a lesion segmentation. Materials and methods: Materials consist in abdominal CT hepatic lesion from 18 patients subjected to liver transplant, partial hepatectomy, or US-guided needle biopsy. Several approaches are implemented to segment the region of liver and, then, detect the lesion ROI. Results: A Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Network is followed for HCC grading. The obtained good results confirm the robustness of the segmentation algorithms leading to a more accurate classification. ",

        "abstract": "In this work we conduct a thorough examination of utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques for classifying meteors based on their characteristics. The focus of the research is the analysis of light curves emitted by meteors as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere, including aspects such as luminosity, duration, and shape. Through extracting features from these light curves and comparing them to established meteors orbits, valuable information about the meteor&#8217;s origin and chemical makeup is sought to be obtained. A significant contribution of the thesis is the development of methods for classifying meteors by extracting features from the light curve shape through the usage of unsupervised classification algorithms. This approach allows for the automatic classification of meteors into various groups based on their properties, obviating the need for manual annotation. Data for the research is collected by a three-camera setup at the Armagh observatory, comprising one medium-angle camera and two wide-angle cameras. This setup enables the capturing of detailed images of meteor light curves, as well as various other observations such as coordinate and angular data. The research also involves the use of machine learning algorithms for data reduction and classification tasks. By applying these techniques to the data collected from the camera setup, the identification of parent objects based on chemical composition and meteor path is facilitated, along with the acquisition of other valuable information about the meteors. In summary, the findings of the research should demonstrate the potential of utilizing machine learning and computer vision methods in the study of meteors entering the Earth's atmosphere. The results contribute to a more profound understanding of the properties and origins of meteors and hold the potential to inform future research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBreast cancer is a severe health issue that affects women all over the world, underscoring the need for reliable and effective screening techniques. The early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer are made possible by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems that rely on mammograms. This study introduces a unique deep-learning model that uses transfer learning to identify and categorize breast cancer automatically. Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown in several recent studies to diagnose breast cancer in mammograms with performance comparable to or even outperforming that of human experts. In order to extract features from the dataset from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS), the proposed model uses pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like ResNet50 and Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG)-16. This novel deep-learning model holds significant potential for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of breast cancer detection and classification.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping an automatic tumor detector for MRI medical images is a major challenge in neuro-oncology. The availability of such a tool would be a valuable assistance for the radiologists. Numerous works have tried to segment the tumor tissues, others have attempted to localize the tumor globally. In this work we focus on this second class of methods and we compare two drastically different strategies. The first one is an assumption-free anomaly detector build over a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and the second one is a VGG classifier that embed Attention-Gated (AG) units to focus on the target structures at almost no additional computational cost. This comparison is first conducted on the publicly available BraTS glioma dataset for which published performance results can serve as reference, and extended as such (ie., without transfer learning) to two internal image datasets, namely Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and Metastasis. The results demonstrate that the VAE and AG-VGG strategies can be used, up to a certain extent, to localize brain tumors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate MRI segmentation is a crucial part of modern medical diagnostics and is essential for early disease diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Vision Transformers (ViT), Kernel-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (M-SVM) are all presented in this study as part of a novel hybrid approach to MRI segmentation that improves accuracy and efficiency.Our method employs ViT, which rapidly extracts high-level features from MRI patches, in combination with kernel-based convolutional neural networks, which are well-known for their ability to capture intricate patterns in image data. The M-SVM then refines the classification process, separating the pixels into distinct classes that are suggestive of different tissue types, and the segmentation phase begins without any problems. In addition to increasing the accuracy of MRI segmentation, initial findings suggest that this novel method might set an innovative standard for the analysis of medical images. This research has the potential to be an important development in medical imaging, which would significantly advance the current state of the art in healthcare technology by improving the accuracy with which diagnoses are made and the effectiveness of treatment plans.",

The desire to automate maximum construction processes with less human interference has led the industry and research community to inclined towards artificial intelligence. This chapter has been themed on automated construction monitoring practices by adopting material classification via machine learning (ML) techniques. The study has been conducted by following the structure review approach to gain an understanding of the applications of ML techniques for construction progress assessment. Data were collected from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases, concluding 14 relevant studies. The literature review depicted the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques as more effective than other ML techniques for material classification. The last section of this chapter includes a python-based ANN model for material classification. This ANN model has been tested for construction items (brick, wood, concrete block, and asphalt) for training and prediction. Moreover, the predictive ANN model results have been shared for the readers, along with the resources and open-source web links.",

Traffic flow prediction is of a great importance for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) which helps to optimize the traffic regulation of a transportation in the city. Nowadays, several researches have been studied so far on traffic flow prediction, accurate prediction has not yet been exploited by most of existing studies due to the impact of inability to effectively deal with spatial temporal features of the times series data. Traffic information in transportation system will also be affected by different factors. In this research we intended to study various models for Traffic flow prediction on the basis machine learning and deep learning approaches. Factors affecting the performance of traffic flow prediction intensity are studied as well. Benchmark performance evaluation metrics are also reviewed.  Generally, this manuscript covers relevant methods and approaches, review the state-of-art works with respect to different traffic flow prediction technique help researchers in exploring future directions so as to realize robust traffic flow prediction.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImage defogging is an innovative strategy for recovering images in foggy environments that has gotten a lot of attention in recent years because of its use in surveillance systems. The standard defogging algorithm, on the other hand, has difficulty merging the depth of picture detail and the colour of the picture. In this paper, a novel Accident Prevention Technique (Deep-APT) has been proposed to effectively restore fog-free images and prevent accidents using FasterRCNN network. Initially, a dashboard camera monitors the road ahead of the vehicle and collects video. This video sequence is converted to frames. The transformed images are pre-processed using an Adaptive dual threshold Tetrolet transform that preprocess foggy images to fog-free images it is used to remove noise in the input image. Based on the defogged image, use FasterRCNN technology to detect objects in front of the car. The Deep-APT method has been simulated using MATLAB. The experimental result shows the proposed Deep-APT yields an overall accuracy is 99.52%. As compared to existing techniques, the proposed FasterRCNN network shows better results in terms of precision, F1 score, accuracy, and recall. Using DAWN dataset, the MSE, SSIM and PSNR values for the proposed method are 0.12, 0.65 and 0.12. The Deep-APT network improves the overall accuracy of 15.43%, and 4.72% better than CR-YOLnet, and RDL respectively.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has gained immense popularity across various domains for assisting human decision-making, including finance, biology, medicine, engineering, games, and news. Despite the use of statistical learning methods for clinical decision support for several years, the application of deep learning in the clinical domain is mostly limited to literature and not widely used in practice, except for image-related tasks. Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), a crucial component of clinical decision support systems, still relies on rule-based or statistical-based solutions, while other domains have extensively employed deep learning-based approaches. This paper aims to highlight the challenges that deep learning faces for clinical NLP applications and to identify opportunities that remain unexplored. The objective is to provide a comprehensive view of clinical NLP to deep learning researchers and to encourage their active contribution to this field.",

The research emphasizes the model's impressive precision in correctly identifying cases without ARMD, while also revealing a notable limitation in its ability to identify positive ARMD cases. The study underscores the critical importance of achieving higher sensitivity (recall) for early intervention in ARMD cases. To address this limitation, future enhancements are necessary, including the expansion of the training dataset and the exploration of advanced improvement techniques. This research offers valuable insights into the potential for enhanced ARMD detection methods. Key findings highlight the model's strengths in precision and identify opportunities for further development to ensure early and accurate intervention in ARMD cases.

In the present study, a deep learning network, Interfruit, was built to classify various types of fruit images. A fruit dataset involving 40 categories was also constructed to train the network model and to assess its performance. According to the evaluation results, the overall accuracy of Interfruit reached 93.17% in the test set, which was superior to that of several advanced methods. According to the findings, the classification system, Interfruit, recognizes fruits with high accuracy, which has a broad application prospect.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationThe complexes formed by binding of proteins to RNAs play key roles in many biological processes, such as splicing, gene expression regulation, translation, and viral replication. Understanding protein-RNA binding may thus provide important insights to the functionality and dynamics of many cellular processes. This has sparked substantial interest in exploring protein-RNA binding experimentally, and predicting it computationally. The key computational challenge is to efficiently and accurately infer RNA-binding models that will enable prediction of novel protein-RNA interactions to additional transcripts of interest.ResultsWe developed DLPRB, a new deep neural network (DNN) approach for learning protein-RNA binding preferences and predicting novel interactions. We present two different network architectures: a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The novelty of our network hinges upon two key aspects: (i) the joint analysis of both RNA sequence and structure, which is represented as a probability vector of different RNA structural contexts; (ii) novel features in the architecture of the networks, such as the application of RNNs to RNA-binding prediction, and the combination of hundreds of variable-length filters in the CNN. Our results in inferring accurate RNA-binding models from high-throughput in vitro data exhibit substantial improvements, compared to all previous approaches for protein-RNA binding prediction (both DNN and non-DNN based). A highly significant improvement is achieved for in vitro binding prediction, and a more modest, yet statistically significant,improvement for in vivo binding prediction. When incorporating experimentally-measured RNA structure compared to predicted one, the improvement on in vivo data increases. By visualizing the binding specificities, we can gain novel biological insights underlying the mechanism of protein RNA-binding.AvailabilityThe source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ilanbb/dlprb.Contactyaronore@bgu.ac.ilSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

        "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies are rapidly becoming the extension of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), holding the potential of profiling gene expression at a single-cell resolution while maintaining cellular compositions within a tissue. Having both expression profiles and tissue organization enables researchers to better understand cellular interactions and heterogeneity, providing insight into complex biological processes that would not be possible with traditional sequencing technologies. The data generated by ST technologies are inherently noisy, high-dimensional, sparse, and multi-modal (including histological images, count matrices, etc.), thus requiring specialized computational tools for accurate and robust analysis. However, many ST studies currently utilize traditional scRNAseq tools, which are inadequate for analyzing complex ST datasets. On the other hand, many of the existing ST-specific methods are built upon traditional statistical or machine learning frameworks, which have shown to be sub-optimal in many applications due to the scale, multi-modality, and limitations of spatially-resolved data (such as spatial resolution, sensitivity and gene coverage). Given these intricacies, researchers have developed deep learning (DL)-based models to alleviate ST-specific challenges. These methods include new state-of-the-art models in alignment, spatial reconstruction, and spatial clustering among others. However, deep-learning models for ST analysis are nascent and remain largely underexplored. In this review, we provide an overview of existing state-of-the-art tools for analyzing spatially-resolved transcriptomics, while delving deeper into the DL-based approaches. We discuss the new frontiers and the open questions in this field and highlight the domains in which we anticipate transformational DL applications.",

        "abstract": "Cancer refers to a group of diseases that are defined by abnormal cell proliferation and can spread to other parts of the body. Pancreatic cancer originates in the organ behind the lower stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes as well as hormones that help regulate sugar metabolism. Pancreas cancer is usually discovered late, spreads quickly, and has a poor prognosis. Cancer-specific symptoms may not appear until later stages, and there are no reliable screening techniques to identify high-risk patients. The manual method of checking whether a patient has Pancreatic cancer or not can be time-consuming and it can be tedious because it required experience in Radiologist interpretation; to avoid poor decisions by giving wrong diagnoses to patients. One of the leading causes of cancer death is pancreatic cancer; however, if found early enough, it can be treated. To solve this issue, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been developed, trained, and tested using an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan images dataset to detect pancreatic tumors by many authors. To detect the tumor, it employs image processing techniques of a convolution neural network to detect the tumorous area in the image after it has been pre-processed. It was observed that the technique gives better accuracy in tumor detection.\r\n ",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia, also known as bronchitis, is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Pneumonia can be fatal to an infected person because the lungs cannot exchange air. The disease primarily affects infants and people over the age of 65. Every year, nearly 4 million people are killed by the disease, which affects an estimated 420 million people. It is critical to detect and diagnose this condition as soon as possible. Diagnosing the condition using the patient's x-ray is the most effective method. Experienced radiologists will use a chest x-ray of the affected patient to make this informed decision. Recently, coronavirus is a contagious viral disease caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. This virus affects the human respiratory system. The virus also causes pneumonia (COVID pneumonia), which is far more dangerous than normal pneumonia. The main purpose of this task is to study and compare several deep learning enhancement techniques applied to medical x-ray and CT scan images for the detection of COVID19 (pneumonia).\r\nA convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to design a model that can distinguish between COVID19 pneumonia and normal pneumonia. In addition, image enhancement techniques (histogram equalization (HE), contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)) have been processed against the dataset to find more efficient methods and models for detecting pneumonia. A dataset of 6432 CXRs were used - 576 COVID pneumonia CXRs, 1583 normal pneumonia CXRs, and 4273 healthy lung CXRs. Based on the results, it was observed that the equalized histogram and the equalized dataset of CLAHE run faster than the original dataset. This requires a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that can distinguish between COVID pneumonia, normal pneumonia, and healthy lungs. In addition, the improved VGG16 achieved 96% accuracy in the detection of X-ray images of COVID19 - pneumonia.",

        "abstract": "In general, signatures are used to authenticate an individual's authenticity. A solid way of certifying the legitimacy of a signature is still waiting for. The approach offered in this paper will allow people to identify signatures to determine whether a signature is forged or genuine. We have tried to automate the signature verification procedure using Convolutionary Neural Networks in our system. In computer applications such as picture registration and identification of objects, image classification and recovery, feature detectors and descriptors have a key role to play. This article discusses the performance analysis of numerous characteristic and descriptor detectors like SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRIEF, BRISK, FREAK. The number of matching points in areas overlapping between images and subjective stitching accuracy were analysed in terms of the number of features. The removal of varied symmetrical characteristics of the image enhances the possibility that different scene views can reliably satisfy the requirements. One experiment result show that the maximum number of detected key points is AGAST, FAST and BRISK detection, but the lesser number of extracted key points is STAR, AKAZE and MSER. In addition, each algorithm's speed is recorded.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing need to develop effective systems for analyzing student performance in educational institutions. This study presents a deep learning-based system for comprehensive student performance analysis that focuses on calculating students' performance and determining which ones are eligible for placements, in need of support, or at risk of dropping out. A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in the proposed system to predict how well students will do in their fourth year. The system is able to learn the temporal patterns and dependencies in the data thanks to the use of three years' worth of student marks data as the input to the LSTM model. The LSTM model's efficacy in predicting student performance has been evaluated through extensive testing and evaluation. The outcomes show a surprising exactness of 99.9% in distinguishing understudies' presentation levels. By utilizing the force of profound learning, the created framework empowers instructive establishments to actually recognize and separate between great entertainers, unfortunate entertainers, and understudies needing extra help. In addition, it makes it easier to identify students who are qualified for placements, which aids in career planning and provides opportunities. Additionally, the system facilitates timely support and intervention for students at risk of dropping out by assisting in early intervention. By utilizing the capabilities of deep learning methods, specifically LSTM models, this study contributes to the field of student performance analysis by providing useful insights and accurate predictions. The developed system has the potential to improve educational institutions' decision-making processes, enabling students to receive individualized guidance and targeted interventions, resulting in improved educational outcomes and student success.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn this paper, we present a deep learning method, DDMReg, for accurate registration between diffusion MRI (dMRI) datasets. In dMRI registration, the goal is to spatially align brain anatomical structures while ensuring that local fiber orientations remain consistent with the underlying white matter fiber tract anatomy. DDMReg is a novel method that uses joint whole-brain and tract-specific information for dMRI registration. Based on the successful VoxelMorph framework for image registration, we propose a novel registration architecture that leverages not only whole brain information but also tract-specific fiber orientation information. DDMReg is an unsupervised method for deformable registration between pairs of dMRI datasets: it does not require nonlinearly pre-registered training data or the corresponding deformation fields as ground truth. We perform comparisons with four state-of-the-art registration methods on multiple independently acquired datasets from different populations (including teenagers, young and elderly adults) and different imaging protocols and scanners. We evaluate the registration performance by assessing the ability to align anatomically corresponding brain structures and ensure fiber spatial agreement between different subjects after registration. Experimental results show that DDMReg obtains significantly improved registration performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, we demonstrate successful generalization of DDMReg to dMRI data from different populations with varying ages and acquired using different acquisition protocols and different scanners.",

        "abstract": "AbstractData from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate a worldwide occurrence of 2 to 3 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer annually. The American Cancer Society estimates that the incidence reaches 5.4 million in the United States alone. In cases of fatal diseases, early detection received great attention from the population and the media due to the premise that the earlier a cancer is identified, the greater the chances of cure. It is to be believed that the application of automated methods will help in early diagnosis, especially with the set of images with a variety of diagnoses. Thus, this article presents a system for recognizing dermatological diseases through images with lesions, a machine intervention in contrast to conventional detection based on medical personnel. Our model is designed in three phases, committing to data collection and augmentation, model development, and finally, prediction. We used various AI algorithms such as ANN with image processing tools to form a better structure, leading to higher accuracy of 89%.Contactdheiver.santos@ictbridge.org, dheiver.santos@gmail.com",

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that make use of Neural Network(NN) with many processing layers and parameters. This consumes a lot of computing power and memory during the training and testing phases. A common approach to overcoming this computational limitation of deep learning is to use cloud resources. To do this, data to be processed need to be transferred from the source to the cloud. Cloud-based big data processing presents many challenges as the amount of data continues to grow and the data processing requirements differ. Edge computing has emerged to solve these challenges. This article explores how deep learning is used in edge computing and discusses some of the common challenges that have arisen so far.</p>",

        "abstract": "In training a deep learning system to perform audio transcription, two practical problems may arise. Firstly, most datasets are weakly labelled, having only a list of events present in each recording without any temporal information for training. Secondly, deep neural networks need a very large amount of labelled training data to achieve good quality performance, yet in practice it is difficult to collect enough samples for most classes of interest. In this paper, we propose factorising the final task of audio transcription into multiple intermediate tasks in order to improve the training performance when dealing with this kind of low-resource datasets. We evaluate three data-efficient approaches of training a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network for the intermediate tasks. Our results show that different methods of training have different advantages and disadvantages.",

By first transforming these cries into waveforms, and then into sound spectrograms, the efficiencies and accuracies of different computer learning modules were tested: a support vector machine, a 2-layer neural network, and a long short-term memory model. Finally, an automatic sorter that categorizes each cry was developed. Using this method, it is possible to eliminate error and time wastage when trying to calm a baby. The results of testing the programs demonstrate a high accuracy rate for determining the source of a baby’s cries. This program will enable parents to calm their crying babies in a shorter amount of time, giving them more peace of mind, and perhaps allowing them to get more sleep.",

And deep learning remains a more popular research object. Based on the deep neural network in the field of deep learning, the convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, long and short-term memory network, and Transformer model have been extended. These models improve the performance and processing power of neural networks by introducing new structures and algorithms. This paper will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and deep learning, as well as the details of using the relevant methods of both to help diagnose COVID-19.",

Although we had the technology, it was frequently mishandled or exploited for nefarious or criminal ends rather than for legitimate uses like entertainment and education. Recently, the term \"Deep fake\" has come to refer to the realistic, high-quality videos and images that have been altered. In a literature review, numerous methods for deep fake detection have been described. It is essential to develop detection techniques that can thwart these kinds of frauds and enhance the study of video and audio forensics. With the use of techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Xception Network, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and others, we demonstrate the numerous Deep fake creation and detection approaches currently being researched. These techniques will act as the cornerstone for the creation of a new deep fake detection system that is more accurate and concise. We also performed a comparison examination of several approaches using a standard methodology. </p>",

        "citations": 1,
        "abstract": "Meta-analysis represents the promise of cumulative science--that each successive study brings us greater understanding of a given phenomenon. As such, meta-analyses are highly influential and gaining in popularity. However, there are well-known threats to the validity of meta-analytic results, such as processes like publication bias and questionable research practices which can cause researchers to massively overestimate the evidence in support of a claim. There are many statistical methods to correct for such bias, but no single method has been found to be robust in all realistic conditions. Here, I describe a method that merges statistical simulation and deep learning to achieve an unprecedented level of robust meta-analytic estimation in the face of numerous forms of bias and other historically problematic conditions. Furthermore, the resulting estimator, called DeepMA, has the unique property that it can easily evolve: As new conditions for which robustness is needed are identified, DeepMA can be re-trained to maintain high performance. Given the weaknesses that have been identified for meta-analysis, the current consensus is that it should serve as simply another data point, rather than residing at the top of the hierarchy of evidence. The novel approach I describe, however, holds the potential to eliminate these weaknesses, possibly solidifying meta-analysis as the platinum standard in scientific debate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImage-based modeling refers to the process of constructing a three-dimensional (3D) model based on a set of two dimensional (2D) images. With the development of computer vision and related technologies, image-based modeling has shown considerable potential in recent years. Traditional image-based modeling techniques, such as photogrammetry, structure from motion (SfM), and multi-view stereo (MVS) have some flaws and limitations that prevent widespread application of the technology such as a high demand of high-quality images, specific angular perspectives, and limited replication similarity. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly advancements in deep learning, provides more chances for image-based modeling. The ability of deep learning algorithms to learn from vast amounts of data, generalize to new scenarios, and adapt to the complexities of the real world has unlocked new possibilities for generating more accurate and detailed 3D models from 2D images. This paper will introduce traditional image-based modeling techniques and discuss the potential of deep learning methods in image-based modeling technique and its future development prospects.",

In the life sciences, particularly biology and its subfields, \nthe use of deep learning is slowly but steadily increasing. However,\nprototyping or development of tools for practical applications remains\nin the domain of experienced coders. Furthermore, many tools can be\nquite costly and difficult to put together without expertise in\nArtificial intelligence (AI) computing.\nPoint 2: We built a biological species classifier that\nleverages existing open-source tools and libraries. We designed the\ncorresponding tutorial for users with basic skills in python and a\nsmall, but well-curated image dataset. We included annotated code in\nform of a Jupyter Notebook that can be adapted to any image dataset,\nranging from satellite images, animals to bacteria. The prototype\ndeveloper is publicly available and can be adapted for citizen science\nas well as other applications not envisioned in this paper.\nPoint 3: We illustrate our approach with a case study of 219\nimages of 3 three seastar species. We show that with minimal parameter\ntuning of the AI pipeline we can create a classifier with superior\naccuracy. We include additional approaches to understand the\nmisclassified images and to curate the dataset to increase accuracy.\nPoint 4: The power of AI approaches is becoming increasingly\naccessible. We can now readily build and prototype species classifiers\nthat can have a great impact on research that requires species\nidentification and other types of image analysis.

The identification and characterization of Regions of Interest (ROIs) containing lesions is an important phase allowing an easier classification in two classes of HCCs. Two steps are needed for the detection of lesioned ROIs: a liver isolation in each CT slice and a lesion segmentation. Materials and methods: Materials consist in abdominal CT hepatic lesion from 18 patients subjected to liver transplant, partial hepatectomy, or US-guided needle biopsy. Several approaches are implemented to segment the region of liver and, then, detect the lesion ROI. Results: A Deep Learning approach using Convolutional Neural Network is followed for HCC grading. The obtained good results confirm the robustness of the segmentation algorithms leading to a more accurate classification. ",

Although we had the technology, it was frequently mishandled or exploited for nefarious or criminal ends rather than for legitimate uses like entertainment and education. Recently, the term \"Deep fake\" has come to refer to the realistic, high-quality videos and images that have been altered. In a literature review, numerous methods for deep fake detection have been described. It is essential to develop detection techniques that can thwart these kinds of frauds and enhance the study of video and audio forensics. With the use of techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Xception Network, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and others, we demonstrate the numerous Deep fake creation and detection approaches currently being researched. These techniques will act as the cornerstone for the creation of a new deep fake detection system that is more accurate and concise. We also performed a comparison examination of several approaches using a standard methodology. </p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRecent advancements in the realm of deep learning, particularly in the development of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated AI's ability to tackle complex mathematical problems or solving programming challenges. However, the capability to solve well-defined problems based on extensive training data differs significantly from the nuanced process of making scientific discoveries. Trained on almost all human knowledge available, today's sophisticated LLMs basically learn to predict sequences of tokens. They generate mathematical derivations and write code in a similar way as writing an essay, and do not have the ability to pioneer scientific discoveries in the manner a human scientist would do. In this study we delve into the potential of using deep learning to rediscover a fundamental mathematical concept: integrals. By defining integrals as area under the curve, we illustrate how AI can deduce the integral of a given function, exemplified by inferring $\\int_{0}^{x} t^2 dt = \\frac{x^3}{3}$ and $\\int_{0}^{x} ae^{bt} dt = \\frac{a}{b} e^{bx} - \\frac{a}{b}$. Our experiments show that deep learning models can approach the task of inferring integrals either through a sequence-to-sequence model, akin to language translation, or by uncovering the rudimentary principles of integration, such as $\\int_{0}^{x} t^n dt = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$.",

Ensuring that the crops produced are both safe and wholesome is crucial not only for people as the ultimate consumers of the crops, but also for farmers. Plant diseases are responsible for a significant percentage of crop losses. This alleviates the need for a fast and accurate model to discriminate and identify plants with diseases. The base chapter chosen aims to achieve the same through deep learning. The data set used in the work was obtained from Plant Village Dataset. The work customs deuce pre-trained models, EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121, to citation the traits of the plants. The extracted traits are then fused together through concatenation to allow the model to read the more meaningful crop trait data. This also ensures that the different sets of feature data read by the two models compensate for any feature loss during extraction. It turns out that the above method gives better results associated to other models.",

        "abstract": "Deep clustering incorporates embedding into clustering in order to find a lower-dimensional space suitable for clustering task. Conventional deep clustering methods aim to obtain a single global embedding subspace (aka latent space) for all the data clusters. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a deep multi-representation learning (DML) framework for data clustering whereby each difficult to cluster data group is associated with its own distinct optimized latent space, and all the easy to cluster data groups are associated to a general common latent space. Autoencoders are employed for generating the cluster-specific and general latent spaces. To specialize each autoencoder in its associated data cluster(s), we propose a novel and effective loss function which consists of weighted reconstruction and clustering losses of the data points, where higher weights are assigned to the samples more probable to belong to the corresponding cluster(s). Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DML framework and loss function outperform state-of-the-art clustering approaches. In addition, the results show that the DML method significantly outperforms the SOTA on imbalanced datasets as a result of assigning an individual latent space to the difficult clusters. <br>",

        "abstract": "In this era of technology, for effective treatment of patients, clinical experts are getting great support from automated e-healthcare systems. Nowadays, one of the leading reasons of death is cancer. Some common cancers are breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, skin cancer, brain cancer, and so on. To save human lives from cancer, an effective and timely treatment is required. Many different types of image modalities like CT scan, ultrasound, x-ray, MRI can be used to determine the disease, but traditionally, this was purely dependent on the knowledge and experience of doctors. So, the death rate was quite high and increasing day by day. Machine learning and deep learning are providing robust solutions in this field. There are many deep learning techniques like RNN, CNN, DBN, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks which are providing robust solutions in cancer diagnosis and prognosis so that many human lives can be saved. The objective of this chapter is to give an insight into deep learning techniques in the field of a cancer diagnosis. ",

        "abstract": "With recent advancements in computer network technologies, there has been a growth in the number of security issues in networks. Intrusions like denial of service, exploitation from inside a network, etc. are the most common threat to a network's credibility. The need of the hour is to detect attacks in real time, reduce the impact of the threat, and secure the network. Recent developments in deep learning approaches can be of great assistance in dealing with network interference problems. Deep learning approaches can automatically differentiate between usual and irregular data with high precision and can alert network managers to problems. Deep neural network (DNN) architectures are used with differing numbers of hidden units to solve the limitations of traditional ML models. They also seek to increase predictive accuracy, reduce the rate of false positives, and allow for dynamic changes to the model as new research data is encountered. A thorough comparison of the proposed solution with current models is conducted using different evaluation metrics. ",

In this paper, we propose an emotion detection using deep learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses end to end CNN. To increase computational efficiency of the deep network, we make use of trained weight parameters of the MobileNet to initialize the weight parameters of our system. To make our system independent of the input image size, we place global average pooling layer On top of the last convolution layer of it. Proposed system is validated for emotion detection using two benchmark datasets viz. Cohn–Kanade+ (CK+) and Japanese female facial expression (JAFFE). The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods for emotion detection.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning play a vital role in making smart decisions, especially with huge amounts of data. Identifying the emotional intelligence levels of individuals helps them to avoid superfluous problems in the workplace or in society. Emotions reflect the psychological state of a person or represent a quick (a few minutes or seconds) reactions to a stimulus. Emotions can be categorized on the basis of a person's feelings in a situation: positive, negative, and neutral. Emotional intelligence seeks attention from computer engineers and psychologists to work together to address EI. However, identifying human emotions through deep learning methods is still a challenging task in computer vision. This chapter investigates deep learning models for the recognition and assessment of emotional states with diverse emotional data such as speech and video streaming. Finally, the conclusion summarises the usefulness of DL methods in assessing human emotions. It helps future researchers carry out their work in the field of deep learning-based emotional artificial intelligence.",

        "abstract": "Thyroid nodule is a common disease on a global scale. It is characterized by an abnormal growth of the thyroid tissue. Thyroid nodules are divided into two types: benign and malignant. To ensure effective clinical care, an accurate identification of thyroid nodules is required. One of the most used imaging techniques for assessing and evaluating thyroid nodules is ultrasound. It performs well when it comes to distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. But ultrasound diagnosis is not simple and is highly dependent on radiologist experience. Radiologists sometimes may not notice minor elements of an ultrasound image leading to an incorrect diagnosis. After performing a comparative study of several deep learning-based models implemented with different classification algorithms on an open-source data set, it has been found that ResNet101v2 gave the best accuracy (~96%), F1 score (0.957), sensitivity (0.917), etc. A simple and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) has also been implemented.",

        "abstract": "Self-learning materials (SLM) generally lack the mechanisms for ensuring deep learning but help address the learning needs of large number of learners. Hence, it was retained as the key instructional component for a distance in-service teacher education programme offered by the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), India. However, for the programme’s personal contact programme, a learning design was developed with the aim of addressing the SLM’s pedagogic limitations. This study aimed to determine how learners were using the SLM for learning while the design was being implemented at multiple units of analysis. It used the case-study method, and the findings suggested that the learning design encouraged deep learning processes that included the use of workplace learning as a context for interrogating the SLM and evaluating their relevance. Findings of qualitative studies are not generally generalisable. Nevertheless, this study will help in making informed decisions favouring ‘learning designs’ instead of instructional designs for IGNOU’s future teacher education programmes.",

        "abstract": "A landslide database is of utmost importance for hazard management as well as early warning systems. Historically landslides were manually identified by ground surveys or remote sensing data, but with development in satellite technology open-source satellite imagery has emerged as a preferred data source for landslide identification due to its cost effectiveness. On the other hand, an increase in computing power made computer vision methods especially deep learning popular for satellite image segmentation. Deep learning models require a large amount of data to reach operational performances, however there is very little labelled landslide data present. Labelling satellite imagery is costly and time consuming. Active learning remedies this by optimally selecting the data to label thereby maximizing the performance of the model given the limited data. In this study we present an active learning-based framework to train a segmentation model to identify landslides. The pre- and post-landslide images from sentinel 2 are merged with terrain features to create input data bands. The model is tested on a test database using metrics like IOU. The methodology has been developed with an application in India but can be applied globally.&#160;",

        "abstract": "AbstractUnderstanding the mechanisms of protein-DNA binding is critical in comprehending gene regulation. Three-dimensional DNA shape plays a key role in these mechanisms. In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, Deep DNAshape, that fundamentally changes the currentk-mer based high-throughput prediction of DNA shape features by accurately accounting for the influence of extended flanking regions, without the need for extensive molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. By using the Deep DNAshape method, refined DNA shape features can be predicted for any length and number of DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner, providing a deeper understanding of the effects of flanking regions on DNA shape in a target region of a sequence. Deep DNAshape method provides access to the influence of distant flanking regions on a region of interest. Our findings reveal that DNA shape readout mechanisms of a core target are quantitatively affected by flanking regions, including extended flanking regions, providing valuable insights into the detailed structural readout mechanisms of protein-DNA binding. Furthermore, when incorporated in machine learning models, the features generated by Deep DNAshape improve the model prediction accuracy. Collectively, Deep DNAshape can serve as a versatile and powerful tool for diverse DNA structure-related studies.",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development and extension of mobile learning technology, English vocabulary learning has become more extensive, personalized and communicative with the support of the mobile learning environment; at the same time, the creation of this environment has gradually become one of the important ways to learn English vocabulary. However, there are two sides to everything, and mobile learning is no exception. In the learning process, we find that English vocabulary learning becomes more fragmented in the mobile learning environment, and the relevant information is not effectively accessed by learners, lacking some deep learning thinking skills. Deep learning in education is a way of learning that aims to construct more meaningful learning, to understand, generalize, master and apply on the basis of memory, to critically accept and learn new knowledge in conjunction with pre-existing knowledge structures, to establish interconnections between knowledge, and through analysis, to make decisions and solve problems through learning. Based on the research on English vocabulary learning in mobile learning environment, this paper makes corresponding elaborations and suggestions on the problems and effective strategies for deep English vocabulary learning in mobile environment in order to improve learners' efficiency in English vocabulary learning, enhance the depth of learning and improve the thinking ability of learning.",

        "abstract": "Advancement in technology has paved the way for the growth of big data. We are able to exploit this data to a great extent as the costs of collecting, storing, and analyzing a large volume of data have plummeted considerably. There is an exponential increase in the amount of health-related data being generated by smart devices. Requisite for proper mining of the data for knowledge discovery and therapeutic product development is very essential. The expanding field of big data analytics is playing a vital role in healthcare practices and research. A large number of people are being affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and as a result, it becomes very challenging for the family members to handle these individuals. The objective of this chapter is to highlight how deep learning can be used for the early diagnosis of AD and present the outcomes of research studies of both neurologists and computer scientists. The chapter gives introduction to big data, deep learning, AD, biomarkers, and brain images and concludes by suggesting blood biomarker as an ideal solution for early detection of AD. ",

The quality of these tools has led these tamperings to steer clear from the naked eye. One such tampering method is called the Copy-Move tampering where a region of the image is copied and pasted elsewhere in the image. We propose a method to deal with this. First, the image is broken to blocks using discrete cosine transform. Next, the dimensionality is reduced using the gaussian RBF kernel PCA. Finally, a new iterative interest point detector is proposed and the image is then sent as input to a CNN that predicts whether the image has been forged or not. The experimental results showed that the algorithm gave an excellent percentage of accuracy, outperforming state of the art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose: - Many approaches have been developed to recognize different writing scripts, most of which focus on Latin scripts. However, in the Ethiopic script unavailability of readymade datasets and the attempts of a few studies show that the script requires further investigation by applying different recognition techniques. In addition, image quality degradation and numerous characters in the alphabet are other major problems with Ethiopic-script documents. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based character recognition model for Ethiopic character recognition is proposed. The contribution of this work is the development of a character recognition model using a convolutional neural network.Method: - The model is designed using seven convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Automatic features are extracted from each cropped 28 by 28 images using convolutional and max-pooling layers to prepare for recognition. Results: - The proposed model is trained and tested with customized datasets and achievement of accuracy 97%, which is a promising recognition result of the script.Conclusion: - In future works, the dataset should include all the letters, punctuation marks, and symbols found in Ethiopic scripts for both printed and handwritten text and increase the dataset size for different deep learning algorithms to get better results.",

        "abstract": "A landslide database is of utmost importance for hazard management as well as early warning systems. Historically landslides were manually identified by ground surveys or remote sensing data, but with development in satellite technology open-source satellite imagery has emerged as a preferred data source for landslide identification due to its cost effectiveness. On the other hand, an increase in computing power made computer vision methods especially deep learning popular for satellite image segmentation. Deep learning models require a large amount of data to reach operational performances, however there is very little labelled landslide data present. Labelling satellite imagery is costly and time consuming. Active learning remedies this by optimally selecting the data to label thereby maximizing the performance of the model given the limited data. In this study we present an active learning-based framework to train a segmentation model to identify landslides. The pre- and post-landslide images from sentinel 2 are merged with terrain features to create input data bands. The model is tested on a test database using metrics like IOU. The methodology has been developed with an application in India but can be applied globally.&#160;",

        "abstract": "With the continuous development and extension of mobile learning technology, English vocabulary learning has become more extensive, personalized and communicative with the support of the mobile learning environment; at the same time, the creation of this environment has gradually become one of the important ways to learn English vocabulary. However, there are two sides to everything, and mobile learning is no exception. In the learning process, we find that English vocabulary learning becomes more fragmented in the mobile learning environment, and the relevant information is not effectively accessed by learners, lacking some deep learning thinking skills. Deep learning in education is a way of learning that aims to construct more meaningful learning, to understand, generalize, master and apply on the basis of memory, to critically accept and learn new knowledge in conjunction with pre-existing knowledge structures, to establish interconnections between knowledge, and through analysis, to make decisions and solve problems through learning. Based on the research on English vocabulary learning in mobile learning environment, this paper makes corresponding elaborations and suggestions on the problems and effective strategies for deep English vocabulary learning in mobile environment in order to improve learners' efficiency in English vocabulary learning, enhance the depth of learning and improve the thinking ability of learning.",

With the assistance of Keras library, machine learning (ML)-based DL and various complicated or unresolved issues such as face recognition and voice recognition might be resolved easily. This chapter focuses on the basic concept of Keras-based framework DL library to handle the different real-life problems. The authors discuss the codes of previous libraries and same code run on Keras library and assess the performance on Google Colab Cloud Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The goal of this chapter is to provide you with the newer concept, algorithm, and technology to solve the real-life problems with the help of Keras framework. Moreover, they discuss how to write the code of standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures using Keras libraries. Finally, the codes of validation and training data set to start the training procedure are explored. ",

Conventional ADS protect information transferred through the network or cyber attackers. The stable prevention of anomalies by machine and deep-learning algorithms are applied for cyber-security. Big data solutions handle voluminous data in a short span of time. Big data management is the organization and manipulation of huge volumes of structured data, semi-structured data and unstructured data, but it does not handle a data imbalance problem during the training process. Big data-based machine and deep-learning algorithms for anomaly detection involve the classification of decision boundary between normal traffic flow and anomaly traffic flow.

In this chapter, the authors explore a state-of-the-art generative deep learning method to produce synthetic images and a new better way for evaluating the same. The approach focuses on synthesizing high-resolution images with multiple objects present in an image, given the textual description of the images. The existing literature uses object pathway GAN (OP-GAN) to automatically generate images from text. The work described in this chapter attempts to improvise the discriminator network from the original implementation using OP-GAN. This eventually helps the generator network's learning rate adjustment based on the discriminator output. Finally, the trained model is evaluated using semantic object accuracy (SOA), the same metric that is used to evaluate the baseline implementation, which is better than the metrics used previously in the literature.",

A set of statistical, linguistic, and machine learning techniques are used to represent the information content from various textual sources such as data analysis, research, or investigation. Text is the common way of communication in social media. The understanding of text includes a variety of tasks including text classification, slang, and other languages. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques require extensive pre-processing techniques to handle the text. When a word “Amazon” occurs in the social media text, there should be a meaningful approach to find out whether it is referring to forest or Kindle. Most of the time, the NLP techniques fail in handling the slang and spellings correctly. Messages in Twitter are so short such that it is difficult to build semantic connections between them. Some messages such as “Gud nite” actually do not contain any real words but are still used for communication.",

Deep learning has emerged as a prominent machine learning technique that learns multiple layers or data characteristics and delivers state-of-the-art output. Throughout recent years, deep learning has been widely used in the study of sentiments, along with the growth of deep learning in many other fields of use. This chapter will offer a description of deep learning and its application in the analysis of sentiments. This chapter will focus on the semantic orientation-based approaches for sentiment analysis.

Edge computing is a technique for coping with the increasing demand for streaming data. This is especially important in the case of applications that involve computationally intensive tasks such as driverless cars, autonomous drones, and smart cities. Edge computing is the provision of computing, big data analytics, and storage in such a way that the data comes to the processing power and not vice versa. It relies on a decentralized approach where computational resources are provided at the edge of networks. Edge computing is an emerging field that's getting attention from many vendors and researchers. The data generated by IoT devices is usually too large and complex for cloud-based storage and processing. That's why edge computing can handle data at the source of generation in real time, which speeds up the process of decision making.",

        "abstract": "Distributed deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn and make predictions at scale. This is achieved by having many different computer systems that are connected via the internet. This allows for more parallel processing and faster results. In addition, when it comes to IoT, this type of technology can be used in conjunction with sensors and other devices to create more accurate predictions about the environment around us. Distributed deep learning can be used in many ways with the IoT because it can be applied to various aspects of IoT data processing, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), or anomaly detection. The neural net is the most computationally intensive component of the system, and it requires a significant amount of energy. To make this system more cost-effective, there are two ways to lower the number of memory accesses: by reducing the size of images (so precision decreases), or by increasing network bandwidth so that there are fewer loop iterations required for each memory access.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDeep learning has made great strides in computer vision, but requires substantial labeled data. Manual video annotation is extremely laborious, as annotators must watch entire videos to provide accurate labels. Active learning reduces this effort by selectively querying the most informative examples for labeling. We introduce a unique active learning framework designed specifically for enhancing the efficiency of video classification. It minimizes annotator effort by identifying representative and informative frames, rather than full videos. Our batch selection approach pinpoints useful videos using uncertainty and diversity criteria. Representative sampling then extracts exemplar frames from each video. Annotators only need to label these frames, avoiding watching full videos. Experiments demonstrate our method successfully reduces human annotation cost for video classification. By querying informative, representative frames, it acquires crucial labels without needing exhaustive manual review of all data. We introduce an active learning technique specifically for alleviating the video annotation burden. By requesting labels for a small set of exemplar frames, it achieves high accuracy while minimizing human effort. This makes large-scale video classification more feasible.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms interact with the environment and have achieved considerable success in several decision-making problems. However, DRL requires a significant number of data before it can achieve adequate performance. Moreover, it might have limited applicability when DRL agents are able to learn in a real-world environment. Therefore, some algorithms combine DRL agents with supervised learning and leverage previous additional knowledge. Some have integrated a deep Q-learning network with a behavioral cloning model that can exploit supervised learning as prior learning. The algorithm proposed in this study is also based on these methods and is intended to update the loss function of the existing technique into a Bayesian approach. The supervised loss function used in existing algorithms and the loss function based on the Bayesian method proposed in this study differ in terms of the utilization of prior knowledge. Using prior knowledge and not using prior knowledge, such as the cross entropy being symmetric. As a result of the various OpenAI Gym environments, such as Cart-Pole and MountainCar, the learning convergence performance was improved. In particular, the proposed method can be applied to achieve fairly stable learning during the early stage when learning in a sparse environment is uncertain.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models have had an influence on machine learning-based in bioinformatics applications since they allow for the learning of complicated non-linear interactions between functionalities. Deep learning models also enable information utilized from large unlabeled data that is unrelated to the problem under investigation. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important in a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, immune function, and cellular organization. PPIs analysis is thus vital, as it may spotlight the detection of targeted proteins and their role in the disease and thus help in designing treatments for it. PPIs play critical roles in life processes, and abnormal interactions are linked to a variety of disorders. Identification of interaction sites is critical for understanding disease mechanisms and designing new drugs. Because of the overall cost of experimental methods, effective and efficient computational methods for PPI prediction are extremely valuable. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have produced remarkable results, but their efficacy is highly reliant on protein interpretation and feature extraction. This chapter will explain various deep learning models that can be used in Bioinformatics as well as the challenges they face.",

The lack of proper guidance can result in doing a move incorrectly, causing injury. In this work – we explore the use of a hybrid Deep Learning/Machine Learning approach to classify dance moves as structurally correct or incorrect. Given a video clip of the dancer doing a move, such as the grand plie, the algorithm should detect the correctness of the movement. To capture the overall movement, we proposed various methods to process data, starting with deep learning techniques to convert video frames into landmarks. Next, we investigate several approaches to combining landmarks from multiple frames and training machine learning algorithms on the dataset. The distinction between correct and incorrect grand plies achieved accuracies of over 98%.",

However, if the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model is tested on our own data, the accuracy drops to 26%, which demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm, which performs at 63% on the MotionSense data used to train the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n<i>HumanActivityRecorder</i> is a versatile, retrainable, open-source, and accurate toolbox that is continually tested on new data.

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) is a major focus of discussion in the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector in the United States generates around one trillion Gigabytes of clinical data annually. With limited resources, manually analyzing these massive amounts of data is a tremendously time-consuming. Finding useful patterns and acquiring knowledge from high-dimensional, poorly annotated, heterogeneous and complex clinical data continues to be a significant challenge in the health care sector. Latest advancements in DL have been shown as an efficacious approach to building end-to-end learning models for disease prognosis and diagnosis. In the past, discovering information from data has been accomplished through the use of conventional Machine Learning (ML) techniques. These techniques first require optimal features to be extracted from clinical data before building a disease predictive model on top of them. Problems with these techniques are that they do not scale properly with the increase in data due to a lack of domain knowledge. Firstly, this chapter explores popular DL algorithms for various types of clinical data. These algorithms can potentially prevent infectious disease, reducing operating costs, and efforts. Finally, the challenges while designing and implementing a holistic DL model have been discussed for disease prediction.",

It is highly important for schools and online learning platforms to investigate the feedback to get valuable insights about online teaching process so that both platforms and teachers are able to learn which aspect they can improve to achieve better teaching performance. But handling reviews expressed by students would be a pretty laborious work if they were handled manually as well as it is unrealistic to handle large-scale feedback from e-learning platform. In order to address this problem, both machine learning algorithms and deep learning models are used in recent research to automatically process students' review getting the opinion, sentiment and attitudes expressed by the students. Such studies may play a crucial role in improving various interactive online learning platforms by incorporating automatic analysis of feedback. Therefore, we conduct an overview study of sentiment analysis in educational field presented in recent research, to help people grasp an overall understanding of the sentiment analysis research. Besides, according to the literature review, we identify three future directions that researchers can focus on in automatically feedback processing: high-level entity extraction, multi-lingual sentiment analysis, and handling of figurative language.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCharacterizing the network traffic and identifying running applications play an instrumental role in several network administration tasks such as protecting against malicious behavior, firewalling, and balancing bandwidth usage. This classification, due to its complexity, has brought about several difficulties for researchers. Moreover, recent advances in the Internet, such as encryption-based security protocols, Tor networks, and virtual private networks. have made the classification even more complicated. Although many studies have been conducted to tackle these issues independently, few of them have partially been successful, addressing only one issue. We propose an approach called DeNeTLang, a general traffic classifier that addresses all the above-mentioned challenges. We utilize the automata learning technique to derive the behavioral packet-based model of each application in terms of a k-testable language. As some packets always appear together, we apply machine learning techniques to automatically identify those packets with similar timing and statistical features to increase the granularity of alphabets of the learned languages. This leads to smaller models yet still precise to characterize applications. To classify by a deep neural network, we convert the learned languages to feature vectors. The results of applying DeNeTLang on real traffic indicate that our approach outperforms the stateof-the-art methods both in application identification and traffic characterization tasks. Also, the proposed approach is resilient to noise stem from simultaneous execution of multiple applications.",

In these systems, anomaly detection is one of the issues. Anomaly detection based on user behavior is very essential to secure the machines from the unauthorized activities by anomaly user. Techniques used for an anomaly detection is to learn the daily realistic activities of the user, and later it proactively detects the anomalous situation and unusual activities. In the IOT-related systems, the detection of such anomalous situations can be fine-tuned with minor and major erroneous conditions to the machine learning algorithms that learn the activities of a user. In this chapter, neural networks, with multiple hidden layers to detect the different situation by creating an environment with random anomalous activities to the machine, are proposed. Using deep learning for anomaly detection would help in enhancing the accuracy and speed. ",

In addition, all necessary verification measures and inspections must be performed in order to ensure that the equipment corresponds to the documentation. [1]  Overall, comprehensive quality assurance measures are required in order to ensure that explosion-protected products are safe. However, these are typically costly in terms of time, finances and staff. Visual inspections, in particular, are currently performed by members of staff to a large extent. Unfortunately, their ability to identify errors varies from person to person and depending on their alertness.  The use of deep learning models offers huge potential for reducing the error rate in visual inspections. Smart object recognition enables product errors to be identified with consistent recognition accuracy. When it comes to traceability, too, the use of this technology offers many new opportunities. It enables data (image including estimate of object recognition algorithm) to be recorded during each visual inspection and assigned to the corresponding project.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The Madden&amp;#8211;Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the dominant source of sub-seasonal variability in the tropics. It consists of an Eastward moving region of enhanced convection coupled to changes in zonal winds. It is not possible to predict the precise evolution of the MJO, so subseasonal forecasts are generally probabilistic. Ideally the spread of the forecast probability distribution would vary from day to day depending on the instantaneous predictability of the MJO. Operational subseasonal forecasting models do not have this property. We present a deep convolutional neural network that produces skilful state-dependent probabilistic MJO forecasts. This statistical model accounts for intrinsic chaotic uncertainty by predicting the standard deviation about the mean, and model uncertainty using a Monte-Carlo dropout approach. Interpretation of the mean forecasts from the neural network highlights known MJO mechanisms, providing confidence in the model, while interpretation of the predicted uncertainty indicates new physical mechanisms governing MJO predictability.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in the tourism industry as they assist travelers in making informed decisions about their trips. Traditional recommendation systems use either collaborative filtering or content-based approaches to provide recommendations, which have certain limitations in terms of accuracy and personalization. In this poster, we present a hybrid recommendation system that combines both approaches using deep learning algorithms. Our system uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze and classify images of tourist destinations, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to analyze user-generated content such as reviews and ratings. The system then combines the results of both approaches using a hybrid model that considers both item and user similarities. The model is designed to learn from user feedback and adapt to new trends and changes in the tourism industry. We evaluate our system using real-world data and compare it to traditional recommendation systems. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system provides more accurate and personalized recommendations compared to traditional approaches. We show that our system improves user satisfaction and engagement in the tourism industry. Overall, our hybrid recommendation system provides an innovative approach to solving the limitations of traditional approaches in the tourism industry. The system has the potential to improve user experience and engagement, leading to increased revenue for tourism businesses.",

Cardiac MR Images play an important role in diagnosing and treating cardiac ailments in patients. Automatic segmentation of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Cardiac MRI) is an essential application in clinical practice. In this paper, Cardiac MRI segmentation is performed using a convolutional neural network. ACDC Challenge 2017 dataset is used the training and testing purpose. It consists of data of 100 subjects, including the End Systole and End Diastole phase. The model's performance is measured using the Dice coefficient, achieving an accuracy of 0.90.

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundA high-quality sequence alignment (SA) is the most important input feature for accurate protein structure prediction. For a protein sequence, there are many methods to generate a SA. However, when given a choice of more than one SA for a protein sequence, there are no methods to predict which SA may lead to more accurate models without actually building the models. In this work, we describe a method to predict the quality of a protein’s SA.MethodsWe created our own dataset by generating a variety of SAs for a set of 1,351 representative proteins and investigated various deep learning architectures to predict the local distance difference test (lDDT) scores of distance maps predicted with SAs as the input. These lDDT scores serve as indicators of the quality of the SAs.ResultsUsing two independent test datasets consisting of CASP13 and CASP14 targets, we show that our method is effective for scoring and ranking SAs when a pool of SAs is available for a protein sequence. With an example, we further discuss that SA selection using our method can lead to improved structure prediction.",

        "abstract": "Activation Functions are crucial parts of the Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks. From the Biological point of view, a neuron is just a node with many inputs and one output. A neural network consists of many interconnected neurons. It is a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; device that receives data at the input and provides a response. The function of neurons is to process and transmit information; the neuron is the basic unit in the nervous system. Carly Vandergriendt (2018) stated the human brain at birth consists of an estimated 100 billion Neurons. The ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence is called Machine Learning. Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks was designed to work like a human brain with the aid of arbitrary choice of Non-linear Activation Functions. Currently, there is no rule of thumb on the choice of Activation Functions, &ldquo;Try out different things and see what combinations lead to the best performance&rdquo;, however, sincerely; the choice of Activation Functions should not be Trial and error. Jamilu (2019) proposed that Activation Functions shall be emanated from AI-ML-Purified Data Set and its choice shall satisfy Jameel&rsquo;s ANNAF Stochastic and or Deterministic Criterion. The objectives of this paper are to propose instances where Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks are SUPERINTELLIGENT. Using Jameel&rsquo;s ANNAF Stochastic and or Deterministic Criterion, the paper proposed four classes where Deep Learning Artificial Neural Networks are Superintelligent namely; Stochastic Superintelligent, Deterministic Superintelligent, and Stochastic-Deterministic 1st and 2nd Levels Superintelligence. Also, a Normal Probabilistic-Deterministic case was proposed.",

        "abstract": "AbstractConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools that can be trained on image classification tasks and share many structural and functional similarities with biological visual systems and mechanisms of learning. In addition to serving as a model of biological systems, CNNs possess the convenient feature of transfer learning where a network trained on one task may be repurposed for training on another, potentially unrelated, task. In this retrospective study of public domain MRI data, we investigate the ability of neural networks to be trained on brain cancer imaging data while introducing a unique camouflage animal detection transfer learning step as a means of enhancing the network’s tumor detection ability. Training on glioma, meningioma, and healthy brain MRI data, both T1- and T2-weighted, we demonstrate the potential success of this training strategy for improving neural network classification accuracy both quantitatively with accuracy metrics and qualitatively with feature space analysis of the internal states of trained networks. In addition to animal transfer learning, similar improvements were noted as a result of transfer learning between MRI sequences, specifically from T1 to T2 data. Image sensitivity functions further this investigation by allowing us to visualize the most salient image regions from a network’s perspective while learning. Such methods demonstrate that the networks not only ‘look’ at the tumor itself when deciding, but also at the impact on the surrounding tissue in terms of compressions and midline shifts. These results suggest an approach to brain tumor MRIs that is comparatively similar to that of trained radiologists while also exhibiting a high sensitivity to subtle structural changes resulting from the presence of a tumor.Summary StatementConvolutional neural networks can be trained with transfer learning to accurately detect and classify brain tumor MRIs while simultaneously demonstrating an approach to imaging data resembling that of trained radiologists.Key Results-Transfer learning from camouflage animal recognition neural networks, and between T1-T2 MRI sequence, improved brain tumor detection and classification accuracy in retrospective study.-Trained neural networks correctly identified oligoastrocytomas as an intermediate of astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas, as visualized by feature space mapping.-Image sensitivity maps of networks suggested a high sensitivity to midline shifts, tissue compressions, and symmetrical comparisons of brain regions for accurate tumor classification.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and its enabling technologies in industries, product flow management, healthcare, transportation and other smart environments. The provision of IoT devices with IP (Internet Protocol) address allows for communication between these cyber-physical systems without any intervention. Lack of security on these end devices has led to many attacks like denial-of-service, Botnets, identity theft and data theft attacks. Mirai, Torii, Emotet, Dridex, Trickbot, Glupteba and QBots are all example of IoT vulnerabilities. Artificial intelligence enables to build strong secure cyber-physical systems. Machine learning and Deep learning techniques combats cyber-attacks by detection and prevention of these Botnets. In this paper, we explore on Botnet attacks that is prevalent in IoT devices because of lack of standards in security when manufacturing or illiteracy of security awareness by the users. Machine learning and Deep learning are prospective solutions to detect and prevent cyber intrusions on IoT devices using anomaly detection. In this paper, firstly we present a framework for Botnet detection to detect an attack on real time traffic. Secondly, we compare and contrast different machine learning and deep learning algorithms for detection of Botnets on the standard features using the Aposemat IoT-23 dataset. Among the deep learning models Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) efficiently detects Botnets with 99.87% accuracy. Thirdly, the raw packet captured (pcap) files form Aposemat IoT-23 dataset are analyzed for attacks using Wireshark tool. Then deep learning model GRU is used to detect the malware attacks with accuracy of 99.89 and better time complexity. Finally, we compare the models based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and time complexity to deduce the best model on both feature based and featureless IoT traffic.",

This application uses a neural network to predict precipitation based on historical weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Models are trained on large datasets of weather information to learn the complex relationships between weather variables and precipitation. The application provides accurate and timely rainfall forecasts to help farmers plan their crops, water managers allocate resources, and responders prepare for potential floods and droughts. Overall, this application has the potential to reduce the impact of extreme weather events and improve our ability to make more informed decisions related to water resource management.",

Their success is mainly due to the availability of both low cost\nintegrated devices, equipped with compact antenna arrays, and computationally\nefficient signal processing techniques. An increasingly important role in the\nfield of radar signal processing is played by machine learning and deep\nlearning techniques. Their use has been first taken into consideration in human\ngesture and motion recognition, and in various healthcare applications. More recently,\ntheir exploitation in object detection and localization has been also\ninvestigated. The research work accomplished in these areas has raised various\ntechnical problems that need to be carefully addressed before adopting the\nabove mentioned techniques in real world radar systems. In this manuscript, a\ncomprehensive overview of the machine learning and deep learning techniques\ncurrently being considered for their use in radar systems is provided.\nMoreover, some relevant open problems and current trends in this research area\nare analysed. Finally, various numerical results, based on both synthetically\ngenerated and experimental datasets, and referring to two different\napplications are illustrated.

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving\nusing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving\ndatasets. Unlike existing techniques, our proposed technique takes the learning loss into\naccount under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. We apply DRL to object\ndetection and safe navigation while enhancing a self-driving vehicle’s ability to discern meaningful information from surrounding data. For efficient environmental perception and object\ndetection, various Q-learning based methods have been proposed in the literature. Unlike\nother works, this thesis proposes a collaborative deterministic as well as stochastic policy\ngradient based on DRL. Our technique is a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE),\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC) that adequately\ntrains a self-driving vehicle. In this work, we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe\nautonomous driving without colliding with an obstacle or steering off the track. We propose\na collaborative framework that utilizes best features of VAE, DDPG, and SAC and models\nautonomous driving as partly stochastic and partly deterministic policy gradient problem in\ncontinuous action space, and continuous state space. To ensure that the vehicle traverses the\nroad over a considerable period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a\nhigher negative penalty is associated with an unfavourable action and a comparatively lower\npositive reward is awarded for favourable actions. We also examine the variations in policy\nloss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for ‘VAE+DDPG’ and ‘VAE+SAC’\nover the learning process.",

With the continued generation of quantitative chemical reaction data and development of methods that leverage such data, we expect many more methods for reactivity prediction to become available in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Seismic inversion methods performed by a deep neural network trained in a supervised learning manner have shown successful inversion performance in synthetic data examples that target small areas. These deep-learning-based seismic inversions use time-domain wavefields as input data and subsurface velocity models as output data. Since the time-domain wavefields include both traveltimes and amplitudes of seismograms, the size of the input data is considerably large. Therefore, studies that apply deep-learning-based seismic inversions trained on large amounts of field-scale data have not yet been conducted. In this study, to apply the deep-learning-based seismic inversion technique to field-scale data, the velocity models are predicted using only traveltimes of seismic waves as the input data instead of the full time-domain wavefields. If the traveltime information is used as input data, the resolution of the inversion result is diminished, but the data size is significantly decreased, which can reduce GPU memory usage and speed up network training. We call this approach deep-learning traveltime tomography. The results obtained from this method can also be used as initial velocity models for full-waveform inversion. For network training, a large number of field-scale synthetic velocity models and corresponding first-arrival traveltimes with towed-streamer acquisition are created, and then the network is trained with the synthetic dataset. As a result of performing deep-learning traveltime tomography on an example of synthetic velocity models simulating the seafloor strata, inversion results similar to the labels were obtained. Therefore, it was confirmed that the deep-learning traveltime tomography method can immediately predict a field-scale velocity model, unlike the existing deep-learning-based seismic inversion.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, humans can communicate easily with others by recognizing speech and text characters, particularly facial expressions. In human communication, it is critical to comprehend their emotion or implicit expression. Indeed, facial expression recognition is vital for analyzing the emotions of conversation partners, which can contribute to a series of matters, including mental health consulting. This technique enables psychiatrists to select appropriate questions based on their patients’ current emotional state. The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learningbased model for detecting and recognizing emotions on human faces. We divided the experiment into two parts: Faster R-CNN and mini-Xception architecture. We concentrated on four distinct emotional states: angry, sad, happy, and neutral. Both models implemented using the Faster R-CNN and the mini-Xception architectures were compared during the evaluation process. The findings indicate that the mini-Xception architecture model produced a better result than the Faster R-CNN. This study will be expanded in the future to include the detection of complex emotions such as sadness.",

The number of data were increased by adding noisy data to the data set used. The classification was made on the preprocessed images using SVM, ANN, LDA + KNN, and CNN methods. It has been determined that the highest identification accuracy is achieved when CNN is used, and CNN method provides higher performance compared to other methods. With the proposed identification system, after multiple runs, an average accuracy of 99.64% is achieved with the CNN machine learning method.",

In this chapter, the authors explore a state-of-the-art generative deep learning method to produce synthetic images and a new better way for evaluating the same. The approach focuses on synthesizing high-resolution images with multiple objects present in an image, given the textual description of the images. The existing literature uses object pathway GAN (OP-GAN) to automatically generate images from text. The work described in this chapter attempts to improvise the discriminator network from the original implementation using OP-GAN. This eventually helps the generator network's learning rate adjustment based on the discriminator output. Finally, the trained model is evaluated using semantic object accuracy (SOA), the same metric that is used to evaluate the baseline implementation, which is better than the metrics used previously in the literature.",

A set of statistical, linguistic, and machine learning techniques are used to represent the information content from various textual sources such as data analysis, research, or investigation. Text is the common way of communication in social media. The understanding of text includes a variety of tasks including text classification, slang, and other languages. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques require extensive pre-processing techniques to handle the text. When a word “Amazon” occurs in the social media text, there should be a meaningful approach to find out whether it is referring to forest or Kindle. Most of the time, the NLP techniques fail in handling the slang and spellings correctly. Messages in Twitter are so short such that it is difficult to build semantic connections between them. Some messages such as “Gud nite” actually do not contain any real words but are still used for communication.",

Although deep learning has been applied to this problem, its accuracy is not as good as intra-protein contact prediction.ResultsWe propose a new deep learning method GLINTER (Graph Learning of INTER-protein contacts) for interfacial contact prediction of dimers, leveraging a rotational invariant representation of protein tertiary structures and a pretrained language model of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Tested on the 13th and 14th CASP-CAPRI datasets, the average top L/10 precision achieved by GLINTER is 54.35% on the homodimers and 51.56% on all the dimers, much higher than 30.43% obtained by the latest deep learning method DeepHomo on the homodimers and 14.69% obtained by BIPSPI on all the dimers. Our experiments show that GLINTER-predicted contacts help improve selection of docking decoys.Contactjinboxu@gmail.com",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) has pervaded most aspects of our life through the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is expected that a typical family home could contain several hundreds of smart devices by 2022. Current network architecture has been moving to fog/edge architecture to have the capacity for IoT. However, in order to deal with the enormous amount of traffic generated by those devices and reduce queuing delay, novel self-learning network management algorithms are required on fog/edge nodes. For efficient network management, Active Queue Management (AQM) has been proposed which is the intelligent queuing discipline. In this paper, we propose a new AQM based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to handle the latency as well as the trade-off between queuing delay and throughput. We choose Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a baseline of our scheme, and compare our approach with various AQM schemes by deploying them on the interface of fog/edge node in IoT infrastructure. We simulate the AQM schemes on the different bandwidth and round trip time (RTT) settings, and in the empirical results, our approach outperforms other AQM schemes in terms of delay and jitter maintaining above-average throughput and verifies that DRL applied AQM is an efficient network manager for congestion.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving\nusing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving\ndatasets. Unlike existing techniques, our proposed technique takes the learning loss into\naccount under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. We apply DRL to object\ndetection and safe navigation while enhancing a self-driving vehicle’s ability to discern meaningful information from surrounding data. For efficient environmental perception and object\ndetection, various Q-learning based methods have been proposed in the literature. Unlike\nother works, this thesis proposes a collaborative deterministic as well as stochastic policy\ngradient based on DRL. Our technique is a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE),\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC) that adequately\ntrains a self-driving vehicle. In this work, we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe\nautonomous driving without colliding with an obstacle or steering off the track. We propose\na collaborative framework that utilizes best features of VAE, DDPG, and SAC and models\nautonomous driving as partly stochastic and partly deterministic policy gradient problem in\ncontinuous action space, and continuous state space. To ensure that the vehicle traverses the\nroad over a considerable period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a\nhigher negative penalty is associated with an unfavourable action and a comparatively lower\npositive reward is awarded for favourable actions. We also examine the variations in policy\nloss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for ‘VAE+DDPG’ and ‘VAE+SAC’\nover the learning process.",

Specifically, the topic has gained more attention after the emergence of deep learning models as a successful tool for automatically classifying videos. In recognition to the importance of video classification task and to summarize the success of deep learning models for this task, this paper presents a very comprehensive and concise review on the topic. There are a number of existing reviews and survey papers related to video classification in the scientific literature. However, the existing review papers are either outdated, and therefore, do not include the recent state-of-art works or they have some limitations. In order to provide an updated and concise review, this paper highlights the key findings based on the existing deep learning models. The key findings are also discussed in a way to provide future research directions. This review mainly focuses on the type of network architecture used, the evaluation criteria to measure the success, and the data sets used. To make the review self- contained, the emergence of deep learning methods towards automatic video classification and the state-of-art deep learning methods are well explained and summarized. Moreover, a clear insight of the newly developed deep learning architectures and the traditional approaches is provided, and the critical challenges based on the benchmarks are highlighted for evaluating the technical progress of these methods. The paper also summarizes the benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation matrices for video classification. Based on the compact, complete, and concise review, the paper proposes new research directions to solve the challenging video classification problem.</p></div></div></div>",

Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising framework for representing the model uncertainty by providing well-calibrated confidence levels for individual predictions. However, the quantification of model uncertainty in conformal prediction remains an active research area, yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art CP methodologies and their theoretical foundations. We propose a probabilistic approach in quantifying the model uncertainty derived from the produced prediction sets in conformal prediction and provide certified boundaries for the computed uncertainty. By doing so, we allow model uncertainty measured by CP to be compared by other uncertainty quantification methods such as Bayesian (e.g., MC-Dropout and DeepEnsemble) and Evidential approaches.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks; however, DNNs have faced criticism for their lack of interpretability. Given the pervasiveness of DNNs in a multitude of applications, it is of paramount importance to fully understand the internal representations and behaviour of DNNs since safe and comprehensible utilization of DNN models is required before incorporating them into decision making processes for real-world applications. In this dissertation, we present several contributions towards understanding, interpreting, and learning representations in DNNs with an emphasis on studying absolute position information, interpreting latent representations to estimate certain semantic concepts, and learning robust representation. First, we study how much absolute position information is encoded in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as the source of this absolute position information. Our experiments reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs and zero padding enables CNNs to encode position information. Next, we analyze the relationship between boundary effects and padding in CNNs with respect to absolute position information. We also demonstrate how a CNN contains positional information in the latent representations if there exists a global pooling layer in the forward pass. We demonstrate that absolute position information is encoded based on the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely not. Second, we perform an empirical study on the ability of DNNs to encode shape information on a neuron-to-neuron and per-pixel level and show evidence that, while DNNs rely on texture information to recognize an object, a substantial amount of shape information is also encoded in DNNs. We further propose a new objective function for increasing a DNN’s ability to encode shape information by maximizing the mutual information between a network’s representations of two stylized images which share the same shape. Finally, we study the feature binding problem and present the first work which applies image blending to learn a robust representation for dense image labeling. Overall, we strongly believe the findings and demonstrated applications in this dissertation will benefit research areas concerned with understanding the different properties of DNNs.</p>",

Deep learning models also enable information utilized from large unlabeled data that is unrelated to the problem under investigation. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important in a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, immune function, and cellular organization. PPIs analysis is thus vital, as it may spotlight the detection of targeted proteins and their role in the disease and thus help in designing treatments for it. PPIs play critical roles in life processes, and abnormal interactions are linked to a variety of disorders. Identification of interaction sites is critical for understanding disease mechanisms and designing new drugs. Because of the overall cost of experimental methods, effective and efficient computational methods for PPI prediction are extremely valuable. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have produced remarkable results, but their efficacy is highly reliant on protein interpretation and feature extraction.

Given a video clip of the dancer doing a move, such as the grand plie, the algorithm should detect the correctness of the movement. To capture the overall movement, we proposed various methods to process data, starting with deep learning techniques to convert video frames into landmarks.

        "abstract": "Due to the number of image editing tools available online, image tampering has been easy to execute. The quality of these tools has led these tamperings to steer clear from the naked eye. One such tampering method is called the Copy-Move tampering where a region of the image is copied and pasted elsewhere in the image. We propose a method to deal with this. First, the image is broken to blocks using discrete cosine transform. Next, the dimensionality is reduced using the gaussian RBF kernel PCA. Finally, a new iterative interest point detector is proposed and the image is then sent as input to a CNN that predicts whether the image has been forged or not. The experimental results showed that the algorithm gave an excellent percentage of accuracy, outperforming state of the art methods.",

        "abstract": "Musical form analysis is a rigorous task that frequently challenges the expertise of human analysts and signal processing algorithms alike. While numerous systems have been proposed to perform the tasks of musical segmentation, genre classification, and single-label segment classification in popular music, none have specifically focused on the analytical process used by classical musicians. Classical music form analysis facilitates a combination of these tasks, including form classification, structural segmentation, and multilabel large- and small-segment classification – tasks that lack feasible algorithms, machine learning models, and extensive research. Form analysis has many applications in the world of music, and a viable analytical system would greatly benefit performing musicians and academic researchers, both in musicology and signal processing. As well, current datasets used for related research tasks lack standardized analytical conventions, including form classification, and suffer from erroneous annotations and extensibility due to the data sources used for the music. In this thesis, we propose a new system to perform the task of automatic musical form analysis using deep learning models, as well as a new standardized dataset.",

However, in the Ethiopic script unavailability of readymade datasets and the attempts of a few studies show that the script requires further investigation by applying different recognition techniques. In addition, image quality degradation and numerous characters in the alphabet are other major problems with Ethiopic-script documents. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based character recognition model for Ethiopic character recognition is proposed. The contribution of this work is the development of a character recognition model using a convolutional neural network.Method: - The model is designed using seven convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Automatic features are extracted from each cropped 28 by 28 images using convolutional and max-pooling layers to prepare for recognition. Results: - The proposed model is trained and tested with customized datasets and achievement of accuracy 97%, which is a promising recognition result of the script.Conclusion: - In future works, the dataset should include all the letters, punctuation marks, and symbols found in Ethiopic scripts for both printed and handwritten text and increase the dataset size for different deep learning algorithms to get better results.",

        "abstract": "Single-relay selection is a simple but efﬁcient scheme for cooperative diversity among multiple user devices. However, the wrong selection of the best relay due to aged channel state information (CSI) remarkably degrades its performance, overwhelming this cooperative gain. Multi-relay selection is robust against channel aging but multiple timing offset (MTO) and multiple carrier frequency offset (MCFO) among spatially-distributed relays hinder its implementation in practical systems. In this paper, therefore, we propose a deep learning-based cooperative diversity method coined predictive relay selection (PRS) that chooses a single relay with the largest predicted CSI, which can alleviate the effect of channel aging while avoiding MTO and MCFO. Performance is evaluated analytically and numerically, revealing that PRS clearly outperforms the existing schemes with a negligible complexity burden.",

In the domain of healthcare, there is a rapid development of intelligent systems for analyzing complicated relationships among data and transforming them into real information for use in the prediction process. Consequently, artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the healthcare industry. Thus comes the role of systems depending on machine learning as well as deep learning in the creation of steps that diagnose and predict diseases, whether from clinical data or based on images, that provide tremendous clinical support by simulating human perception and can even diagnose diseases that are difficult to detect by human intelligence.\nMethods\n The studies discussed in this paper have been presented in journals published by IEEE, Springer, and Elsevier. Machine learning, deep learning, healthcare, surgery, cardiology, radiology, hepatology, and nephrology are some of the terms used to search for these studies. The studies chosen for this survey are concerned with the use of machine learning as well as deep learning algorithms in healthcare prediction.\nResults\n A total of 40 working papers were selected and the methodology for each paper was clarified.\nConclusion\n This paper presents a comprehensive survey as well as the current challenges in healthcare prediction. studies have shown that artificial intelligence plays a significant role in diseases diagnosing.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to investigate quantitative differences in performance in terms of comparing the automated classification of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using two categories of artificial intelligence algorithms: deep learning based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conventional machine learning. We retrospectively enrolled 659 participants (DVT patients, 282; normal controls, 377) who were evaluated using contrast-enhanced lower extremity computed tomography (CT) venography. Conventional machine learning consists of logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosts (XGB). Deep learning based on CNN included the VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50, and Resnet152 models. According to the mean generated AUC values, we found that the CNN-based VGG16 model showed a 0.007 higher performance (0.982 ± 0.014) as compared with the XGB model (0.975 ± 0.010), which showed the highest performance among the conventional machine learning models. In the conventional machine learning-based classifications, we found that the radiomic features presenting a statistically significant effect were median values and skewness. We found that the VGG16 model within the deep learning algorithm distinguished deep vein thrombosis on CT images most accurately, with slightly higher AUC values as compared with the other AI algorithms used in this study. Our results guide research directions and medical practice.",

Involving deep learning methods in cyber forensics can speed up the investigation procedure. Deep learning incorporates areas like image classification, morphing, and behaviour analysis. Forensics happens where data is. People share their activities, pictures, videos, and locations visited on the readily available platform, social media. An abundance of information available on social networking platforms renders them a favourite of cybercriminals. Compromising a profile, a hacker can gain access, modify, and use its data for various activities. Unscrupulous activities on such platforms include stalking, bullying, defamation, circulation of illegal or pornographic material, etc. Social network forensics is more than the application of computer investigation and analysis techniques, such as collecting information from online sources. CNNs and autoencoders can learn and obtain features from an image. ",

Specifically, the topic has gained more attention after the emergence of deep learning models as a successful tool for automatically classifying videos. In recognition to the importance of video classification task and to summarize the success of deep learning models for this task, this paper presents a very comprehensive and concise review on the topic. There are a number of existing reviews and survey papers related to video classification in the scientific literature. However, the existing review papers are either outdated, and therefore, do not include the recent state-of-art works or they have some limitations. In order to provide an updated and concise review, this paper highlights the key findings based on the existing deep learning models. The key findings are also discussed in a way to provide future research directions. This review mainly focuses on the type of network architecture used, the evaluation criteria to measure the success, and the data sets used. To make the review self- contained, the emergence of deep learning methods towards automatic video classification and the state-of-art deep learning methods are well explained and summarized. Moreover, a clear insight of the newly developed deep learning architectures and the traditional approaches is provided, and the critical challenges based on the benchmarks are highlighted for evaluating the technical progress of these methods. The paper also summarizes the benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation matrices for video classification. Based on the compact, complete, and concise review, the paper proposes new research directions to solve the challenging video classification problem.</p></div></div></div>",

Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising framework for representing the model uncertainty by providing well-calibrated confidence levels for individual predictions. However, the quantification of model uncertainty in conformal prediction remains an active research area, yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art CP methodologies and their theoretical foundations. We propose a probabilistic approach in quantifying the model uncertainty derived from the produced prediction sets in conformal prediction and provide certified boundaries for the computed uncertainty. By doing so, we allow model uncertainty measured by CP to be compared by other uncertainty quantification methods such as Bayesian (e.g., MC-Dropout and DeepEnsemble) and Evidential approaches.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks; however, DNNs have faced criticism for their lack of interpretability. Given the pervasiveness of DNNs in a multitude of applications, it is of paramount importance to fully understand the internal representations and behaviour of DNNs since safe and comprehensible utilization of DNN models is required before incorporating them into decision making processes for real-world applications. In this dissertation, we present several contributions towards understanding, interpreting, and learning representations in DNNs with an emphasis on studying absolute position information, interpreting latent representations to estimate certain semantic concepts, and learning robust representation. First, we study how much absolute position information is encoded in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as the source of this absolute position information. Our experiments reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs and zero padding enables CNNs to encode position information. Next, we analyze the relationship between boundary effects and padding in CNNs with respect to absolute position information. We also demonstrate how a CNN contains positional information in the latent representations if there exists a global pooling layer in the forward pass. We demonstrate that absolute position information is encoded based on the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely not. Second, we perform an empirical study on the ability of DNNs to encode shape information on a neuron-to-neuron and per-pixel level and show evidence that, while DNNs rely on texture information to recognize an object, a substantial amount of shape information is also encoded in DNNs. We further propose a new objective function for increasing a DNN’s ability to encode shape information by maximizing the mutual information between a network’s representations of two stylized images which share the same shape. Finally, we study the feature binding problem and present the first work which applies image blending to learn a robust representation for dense image labeling. Overall, we strongly believe the findings and demonstrated applications in this dissertation will benefit research areas concerned with understanding the different properties of DNNs.</p>",

        "abstract": "In essence, smart grids are electrical networks that transmit and distribute electricity in a reliable, effective manner using information and communication technology (ICT). Trust and security are of the utmost importance. False data injection (FDI) attacks are one of the most serious new security problems, and they can drastically raise the price of the energy distribution process. However, rather than smart grid infrastructures, the majority of current research focuses on FDI defenses for conventional electricity networks. By utilizing spatial-temporal correlations between grid components, we create an effective and real-time technique to identify FDI attacks in smart grids called a deep learning framework. We show that the suggested method offers an accurate and dependable solution using realistic simulations based on the smart grid compared to the benchmarked techniques.",

        "abstract": "Studying human postural structure is one of the challenging issues among scholars and physicians. The spine is known as the central axis of the body, and due to various genetic and environmental reasons, it could suffer from deformities leading to physical dysfunction and correspondingly affecting people's quality of life. Radiography is the most common method for detecting these deformities; however, it frequently exposes the patient to X-rays and ionization and consequently increases cancer risk in patients particularly children and pregnant women.The purpose of this research is to provide an entirely safe and non-invasive method to examine the spiral structure and its deformities. Hence, it is attempted to find the exact location of anatomical landmarks on the human back surface, which provides useful and functional information about the status of the human postural structure to the physician. In this study, using Microsoft Kinect sensor, the depth images from the human back surface of 105 people were recorded and, our proposed approach – a deep convolution neural network- was used as a model to estimate the locations of anatomical landmarks. In network architecture, two learning processes, including landmark position and affinity between the two associated landmarks, are successively performed in two separate branches. This is a bottom-up approach; thus, the runtime complexity is considerably reduced, and then the resulting anatomical points are evaluated concerning manual landmarks marked by the operator as the benchmark. Our results showed 86.9% of PDJ and 80% of PCK that demonstrate more effectiveness compared to other methods.",

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important in a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, immune function, and cellular organization. PPIs analysis is thus vital, as it may spotlight the detection of targeted proteins and their role in the disease and thus help in designing treatments for it. PPIs play critical roles in life processes, and abnormal interactions are linked to a variety of disorders. Identification of interaction sites is critical for understanding disease mechanisms and designing new drugs. Because of the overall cost of experimental methods, effective and efficient computational methods for PPI prediction are extremely valuable. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have produced remarkable results, but their efficacy is highly reliant on protein interpretation and feature extraction. This chapter will explain various deep learning models that can be used in Bioinformatics as well as the challenges they face.",

However, if the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model is tested on our own data, the accuracy drops to 26%, which demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm, which performs at 63% on the MotionSense data used to train the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n<i>HumanActivityRecorder</i> is a versatile, retrainable, open-source, and accurate toolbox that is continually tested on new data. This enables researchers to adapt to the behavior being measured and achieve repeatability in scientific studies.\n",

        "abstract": "For online dancers, learning a dance move properly without the feedback of a live instructor can be challenging because it is difficult to determine whether a move is done correctly. The lack of proper guidance can result in doing a move incorrectly, causing injury. In this work – we explore the use of a hybrid Deep Learning/Machine Learning approach to classify dance moves as structurally correct or incorrect. Given a video clip of the dancer doing a move, such as the grand plie, the algorithm should detect the correctness of the movement. To capture the overall movement, we proposed various methods to process data, starting with deep learning techniques to convert video frames into landmarks. Next, we investigate several approaches to combining landmarks from multiple frames and training machine learning algorithms on the dataset. The distinction between correct and incorrect grand plies achieved accuracies of over 98%.",

As a result, the frequency of cyber-attacks against IoT deployments is expected to rise. As a result, each system must be absolutely secure; otherwise, consumers may opt not to utilize the technology. DDoS assaults that recently attacked various IoT networks resulted in massive losses. There is only one way to detect stolen data from software and malware on the IoT network that is discussed in this chapter. To categorize stolen programming with source code literary theft, the tensor flow deep neural system is offered. To communicate raucous information while simultaneously emphasizing the value of each token in terms of source code forgery, tokenization, and measurement, the malware samples were gathered using the Malign dataset. The results show that the methodology proposed for analyzing IoT cyber security threats has a higher classification efficiency than current methodologies. ",

        "abstract": "Fake news is the word making more talk these days be it election, COVID 19 pandemic, or any social unrest. Many social websites have started to fact check the news or articles posted on their websites. The reason being these fake news creates confusion, chaos, misleading the community and society. In this cyber era, citizen journalism is happening more where citizens do the collection, reporting, dissemination, and analyse news or information. This means anyone can publish news on the social websites and lead to unreliable information from the readers' points of view as well. In order to make every nation or country safe place to live by holding a fair and square election, to stop spreading hatred on race, religion, caste, creed, also to have reliable information about COVID 19, and finally from any social unrest, we need to keep a tab on fake news. This chapter presents a way to detect fake news using deep learning technique and natural language processing. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a brain-related disease in which the condition of the patient gets worse with time. AD is not a curable disease by any medication, it is impossible to halt the death of brain cells, but with the help of medication, the effects of AD can be delayed. As not all MCI patients will suffer from AD it is required to accurately diagnose whether a Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI) patient will convert to AD (namely MCI converter MCI-C) or not (namely MCI non-converter MCI-NC), during early diagnosis. There are two modalities positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance image (MRI) used by a physician for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Machine learning and deep learning perform exceptionally well in the field of computer vision where there is a requirement to extract information from high-dimensional data. Researchers use deep learning models in the field of medicine for diagnosis, prognosis, and even to predict the future health of the patient under medication. This research study is a systematic review of publications using machine learning and deep learning methods for early classification of normal cognitive (NC) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study is an effort to provide the details of the two most commonly used modalities PET and MRI for the identification of AD, and to evaluate the performance of both modalities while working with different classifiers.",

The control systems field is one of the subjects that get many impacts of machine learning emergence. System identification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is one of the control systems problems that could be solved by using deep learning methods. In this paper, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are applied toidentify the system of UAV. Three different models of Deep RNNs have been tried, and the results implied that the RNNs-1 was giving more excellent performance both on the testing MSE and RMSE with the values equal to 0.0006 and 0.0242, successively.",

        "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) has pervaded most aspects of our life through the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is expected that a typical family home could contain several hundreds of smart devices by 2022. Current network architecture has been moving to fog/edge architecture to have the capacity for IoT. However, in order to deal with the enormous amount of traffic generated by those devices and reduce queuing delay, novel self-learning network management algorithms are required on fog/edge nodes. For efficient network management, Active Queue Management (AQM) has been proposed which is the intelligent queuing discipline. In this paper, we propose a new AQM based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to handle the latency as well as the trade-off between queuing delay and throughput. We choose Deep Q-Network (DQN) as a baseline of our scheme, and compare our approach with various AQM schemes by deploying them on the interface of fog/edge node in IoT infrastructure. We simulate the AQM schemes on the different bandwidth and round trip time (RTT) settings, and in the empirical results, our approach outperforms other AQM schemes in terms of delay and jitter maintaining above-average throughput and verifies that DRL applied AQM is an efficient network manager for congestion.",

        "abstract": "The fast advancement of computer vision allows for human-computer interaction and has a broad range of applications. Since the first instance of COVID-19 was discovered, the worldwide battle against the pandemic has started. People's everyday actions, in addition to different research and conclusions by medical and healthcare professionals, have become critical in fighting the pandemic. In China, the government has adopted active and effective isolation and closure measures, as well as active public collaboration, such as making it unnecessary to remain inside and wear masks. China, the nation where the pandemic initially broke out, has now established itself as the world's model for epidemic prevention. Of course, people wearing masks deliberately isn't enough. Wearing masks in public areas still requires supervision. Real-world applications utilizing deep learning use deep learning as a critical component. Object detection is extremely important. currently, deep learning detection models and algorithms are using object recognition as their objective, which has achieved tremendous success in finding the object from an image. As this is the era of the COVID-19 virus, people frequently wear masks to cover themselves to minimize the transmission of the coronavirus. Because some portions of the face are concealed, this makes face identification is a very challenging job. In certain cases, traditional facial recognition technology is still inadequate, so it is very urgent to improve the recognition efficiency of the existing face recognition technology on masked faces, as masks are part of life from now for the next two to three years. This study proposes that, in this process, manual inspection be replaced with a deep learning method, and that YOLOV5, the most powerful objection detection algorithm currently available, be used to better apply it in the real world. For this study, First, we use the YOLO V5 to detect face masks. Using Face Net’s trained model, we looked at the images to determine whether the subjects were wearing masks or not. Two separate medical face mask datasets have been brought together in one dataset for research purposes. Mean IoU has been utilized to determine the best number of anchor boxes, hence improving the object detection process. The results showed that the Adam optimizer got an average of 81% accuracy. Finally, a related conclusion is offered in the research as a comparison study. The new detector outperformed related work in terms of accuracy and precision.",

Specifically, the topic has gained more attention after the emergence of deep learning models as a successful tool for automatically classifying videos. In recognition to the importance of video classification task and to summarize the success of deep learning models for this task, this paper presents a very comprehensive and concise review on the topic. There are a number of existing reviews and survey papers related to video classification in the scientific literature. However, the existing review papers are either outdated, and therefore, do not include the recent state-of-art works or they have some limitations. In order to provide an updated and concise review, this paper highlights the key findings based on the existing deep learning models. The key findings are also discussed in a way to provide future research directions. This review mainly focuses on the type of network architecture used, the evaluation criteria to measure the success, and the data sets used. To make the review self- contained, the emergence of deep learning methods towards automatic video classification and the state-of-art deep learning methods are well explained and summarized. Moreover, a clear insight of the newly developed deep learning architectures and the traditional approaches is provided, and the critical challenges based on the benchmarks are highlighted for evaluating the technical progress of these methods. The paper also summarizes the benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation matrices for video classification. Based on the compact, complete, and concise review, the paper proposes new research directions to solve the challenging video classification problem.</p></div></div></div>",

Although deep learning has been applied to this problem, its accuracy is not as good as intra-protein contact prediction.ResultsWe propose a new deep learning method GLINTER (Graph Learning of INTER-protein contacts) for interfacial contact prediction of dimers, leveraging a rotational invariant representation of protein tertiary structures and a pretrained language model of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Tested on the 13th and 14th CASP-CAPRI datasets, the average top L/10 precision achieved by GLINTER is 54.35% on the homodimers and 51.56% on all the dimers, much higher than 30.43% obtained by the latest deep learning method DeepHomo on the homodimers and 14.69% obtained by BIPSPI on all the dimers. Our experiments show that GLINTER-predicted contacts help improve selection of docking decoys.Contactjinboxu@gmail.com",

Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a promising framework for representing the model uncertainty by providing well-calibrated confidence levels for individual predictions. However, the quantification of model uncertainty in conformal prediction remains an active research area, yet to be fully addressed. In this paper, we explore state-of-the-art CP methodologies and their theoretical foundations. We propose a probabilistic approach in quantifying the model uncertainty derived from the produced prediction sets in conformal prediction and provide certified boundaries for the computed uncertainty. By doing so, we allow model uncertainty measured by CP to be compared by other uncertainty quantification methods such as Bayesian (e.g., MC-Dropout and DeepEnsemble) and Evidential approaches.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks; however, DNNs have faced criticism for their lack of interpretability. Given the pervasiveness of DNNs in a multitude of applications, it is of paramount importance to fully understand the internal representations and behaviour of DNNs since safe and comprehensible utilization of DNN models is required before incorporating them into decision making processes for real-world applications. In this dissertation, we present several contributions towards understanding, interpreting, and learning representations in DNNs with an emphasis on studying absolute position information, interpreting latent representations to estimate certain semantic concepts, and learning robust representation. First, we study how much absolute position information is encoded in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as the source of this absolute position information. Our experiments reveal that a surprising degree of absolute position information is encoded in commonly used CNNs and zero padding enables CNNs to encode position information. Next, we analyze the relationship between boundary effects and padding in CNNs with respect to absolute position information. We also demonstrate how a CNN contains positional information in the latent representations if there exists a global pooling layer in the forward pass. We demonstrate that absolute position information is encoded based on the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely not. Second, we perform an empirical study on the ability of DNNs to encode shape information on a neuron-to-neuron and per-pixel level and show evidence that, while DNNs rely on texture information to recognize an object, a substantial amount of shape information is also encoded in DNNs. We further propose a new objective function for increasing a DNN’s ability to encode shape information by maximizing the mutual information between a network’s representations of two stylized images which share the same shape. Finally, we study the feature binding problem and present the first work which applies image blending to learn a robust representation for dense image labeling. Overall, we strongly believe the findings and demonstrated applications in this dissertation will benefit research areas concerned with understanding the different properties of DNNs.</p>",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, humans can communicate easily with others by recognizing speech and text characters, particularly facial expressions. In human communication, it is critical to comprehend their emotion or implicit expression. Indeed, facial expression recognition is vital for analyzing the emotions of conversation partners, which can contribute to a series of matters, including mental health consulting. This technique enables psychiatrists to select appropriate questions based on their patients’ current emotional state. The purpose of this study was to develop a deep learningbased model for detecting and recognizing emotions on human faces. We divided the experiment into two parts: Faster R-CNN and mini-Xception architecture. We concentrated on four distinct emotional states: angry, sad, happy, and neutral. Both models implemented using the Faster R-CNN and the mini-Xception architectures were compared during the evaluation process. The findings indicate that the mini-Xception architecture model produced a better result than the Faster R-CNN. This study will be expanded in the future to include the detection of complex emotions such as sadness.",

In this thesis, a biometric identification system is proposed using dorsal hand vein patterns. The relevant system has been tested on the sample dataset in the literature. The number of data were increased by adding noisy data to the data set used. The classification was made on the preprocessed images using SVM, ANN, LDA + KNN, and CNN methods. It has been determined that the highest identification accuracy is achieved when CNN is used, and CNN method provides higher performance compared to other methods. With the proposed identification system, after multiple runs, an average accuracy of 99.64% is achieved with the CNN machine learning method.",

        "abstract": "Automatic detection of abnormal anatomies or malformations of different structures of the human body is a challenging task that could provide support for clinicians in their daily practice. Compared to normative anatomies, there is a low presence of anatomical abnormalities in patients, and the great variation within malformations make it challenging to design deep learning frameworks for automatic detection. We propose a framework for anatomical abnormality detection, which benefits from using a deep reinforcement learning model for landmark detection trained in normative data. We detect the abnormalities using the variability between the predicted landmarks configurations in a subspace based on a point distribution model of landmarks using Procrustes shape alignment and principal component analysis projection from normative data. We demonstrate the performance of this implementation on clinical CT scans of the inner ear, and show how synthetically created abnormal cochlea anatomy can be detected using the prediction of five landmarks around the cochlea. Our approach shows a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Area Under The Curve (AUC) of 0.97, and 96% accuracy for the detection of abnormal anatomy on synthetic data.",

The complex structure of the brain makes it a challenging responsibility for the researcher to design a model to precisely segment the brain region from the skull and to find any abnormality in the tissue.

We improve the established WENO algorithm by training a compact neural network to dynamically adjust the smoothness indicators within the WENO scheme. This modification boosts the accuracy of the numerical results, particularly in proximity to abrupt shocks. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for additional post-processing steps, distinguishing it from previous deep learning-based methods. We substantiate the superiority of our new approach through the examination of multiple examples from the literature concerning the two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics. Through a thorough investigation of these test problems, encompassing various shocks and rarefaction waves, our novel technique consistently outperforms the traditional fifth-order WENO scheme. This superiority is especially evident in cases where numerical solutions exhibit excessive diffusion or overshoot around shocks.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a recommendation system based on a hybrid learning approach for a personal deep sleep service, called the Customized Deep Sleep Recommender System (CDSRS). Sleep is one of the most important factors for human life in modern society. Optimal sleep contributes to increasing work efficiency and controlling overall well-being. Therefore, a sleep recommendation service is considered a necessary service for modern individuals. Accurate sleep analysis and data are required to provide such a personalized sleep service. However, given the variations in sleep patterns between individuals, there is currently no international standard for sleep. Additionally, service platforms face a cold start problem when dealing with new users. To address these challenges, this study utilizes K-means clustering analysis to define sleep patterns and employs a hybrid learning algorithm to evaluate recommendations by combining user-based and collaborative filtering methods. It also incorporates feedback top-N classification processing for user profile learning and recommendations. The behavior of the study model is as follows. Using personal information received through mobile devices and data, such as snoring, sleep time, movement, and noise collected through AI motion beds, we recommend sleep and receive user evaluations of recommended sleep. This assessment reconstructs the profile and, finally, makes recommendations using top-N classification. The experimental results were evaluated using two absolute error measurement methods: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The research results regarding the hybrid learning methods show 13.2% fewer errors than collaborative filtering (CF) and 10.2% fewer errors than content-based filtering (CBF) on an MSE basis. According to the MAPE, the methods are 14.7% more accurate than the CF model and 9.2% better than the CBF model. These results demonstrate that CDSRS systems can provide more accurate recommendations and customized sleep services to users than CF, CBF, and combination models. As a result, CDSRS, a hybrid learning method, can better reflect a user’s evaluation than traditional methods and can increase the accuracy of recommendations as the number of users increases.",

Terkadang, pengguna tidak selalu mengadaptasikan spesifikasi laptop dengan penggunaannya yang sebenarnya. Sebagai contoh, mereka mungkin membeli laptop dengan spesifikasi tinggi, padahal sebenarnya laptop tersebut akan digunakan untuk pekerjaan yang lebih berat seperti desain grafis, dibandingkan dengan pekerjaan yang hanya membutuhkan pengetikan biasa. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah menghasilkan nilai yang menjadi acuan sebagai kriteria spesifikasi dari sebuah laptop sesuai dengan komponen perangkat keras. Penelitian menggunakan fuzzy model mamdani dengan tahapan pembentukan himpunan, aplikasi fungsi implikasi, komposisi aturan dan defuzzifikasi. Hasil dari penelitian adalah nilai keluaran dengan akurasi 70% dari sistem yang dibuat dengan nilai keluaran yaitu kategori spesifikasi laptop berdasarkan input komponen perangkat keras yang dapat membantu pengguna untuk mengetahui laptop yang dimiliki atau akan dimiliki memiliki kemampuan yang rendah, sedang atau tinggi.",

As a result, it is crucial to have high cancer-predictive accuracy to update patient survival criteria and treatment options. Research on machine learning and deep learning, whether using traditional neural networks or using convolutional neural networks, has spread widely and has proven to be a useful technology. It can be very helpful in early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. According to the six machine learning algorithms used in this study and based on the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic dataset, they are as follows: Naive Bays (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we reached an accuracy of 99.1% with SVM that surpassed all competitors and achieved the highest accuracy. As for deep learning, we have reached an accuracy of up to 99.9%, and this is a reliable result for analysis purposes. In the presented work, the Anaconda environment (Jupyter platform) was used, which uses the Python programming language in all work.",

        "abstract": "One way to improve annotation efficiency is active learning. The goal of active learning is to select images from many unlabeled images, where labeling will improve the accuracy of the machine learning model the most. To select the most informative unlabeled images, conventional methods use deep neural networks with a large number of computation nodes and long computation time, but we propose a non-deep neural network method that does not require any additional training for unlabeled image selection. The proposed method trains a task model on labeled images, and then the model predicts unlabeled images. Based on this prediction, an uncertainty indicator is generated for each unlabeled image. Images with a high uncertainty index are considered to have a high information content, and are selected for annotation. Our proposed method is based on a very simple and powerful idea: select samples near the decision boundary of the model. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than conventional active learning methods on multiple tasks and up to 14 times faster execution time from 1.2 × 106 s to 8.3 × 104 s. The proposed method outperforms the current SoTA method by 1% accuracy on CIFAR-10.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) is an emerging field of research that tries to generalize deep learning architectures to work with non-Euclidean data. Nowadays, combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with GNN for graph-structured problems, especially in multi-agent environments, is a powerful technique in modern deep learning. From the computational point of view, multi-agent environments are inherently complex, because future rewards depend on the joint actions of multiple agents. This chapter tries to examine different types of applying GNN and DRL techniques in the most common representations of multi-agent problems and their challenges. In general, the fusion of GNN and DRL can be addressed from two different points of view. First, GNN is used to influence the DRL performance and improve its formulation. Here, GNN is applied in relational DRL structures such as multi-agent and multi-task DRL. Second, DRL is used to improve the application of GNN. From this viewpoint, DRL can be used for a variety of purposes including neural architecture search and improving the explanatory power of GNN predictions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nChinese negative information recognition is the key technology of natural language processing. Its core is to recognize the negative relationship in the text according to the negative information theory. The recognition and classification of negative information is an important research hotspot of natural language processing. It is of great significance to the establishment of big data around Chinese semantic recognition, such as information retrieval and text mining. It is also a key step to promote Chinese language recognition. Firstly, this paper studies the expression forms of Chinese negative information in the scene of life, and points out that negative information recognition mainly includes negative trigger word recognition, negative coverage recognition and negative focus recognition; Then, it summarizes the current basic knowledge of deep learning and Chinese negative information recognition, analyzes the working principle of CRF and recurrent neural network RNN model, and analyzes the basic theories of Chinese information recognition, such as Chinese corpus data and text preprocessing technology; Finally, the combination of bidirectional long-term and short-term memory network (bltstmn) and traditional CRF model is used to study Chinese negative information recognition. Theoretical research shows that the combination of bltstmn-crf has better applicability to Chinese negative information recognition, and has better improvement in recognition accuracy and fast recognition. In this paper, the recognition of Chinese negative information based on bltstmn-crf is a form of applying deep learning to natural language processing, which can provide a thinking reference for other deep learning networks in natural language processing. In the follow-up, we will further study the application of deep learning to natural language processing.",

So we are proposing our model that uses Deep Learning to detect this disorder, using Fundus Images. The model contains fully connected hidden layers with cost function and activation functions to properly train the model and optimize it and to significantly reduce the computational cost compared to other models. Total 1130 affected and 1130 non affected images are feeded to model in order to train model properly so that model doesn’t get overfitted.",

Specifically, the topic has gained more attention after the emergence of deep learning models as a successful tool for automatically classifying videos. In recognition to the importance of video classification task and to summarize the success of deep learning models for this task, this paper presents a very comprehensive and concise review on the topic. There are a number of existing reviews and survey papers related to video classification in the scientific literature. However, the existing review papers are either outdated, and therefore, do not include the recent state-of-art works or they have some limitations. In order to provide an updated and concise review, this paper highlights the key findings based on the existing deep learning models. The key findings are also discussed in a way to provide future research directions. This review mainly focuses on the type of network architecture used, the evaluation criteria to measure the success, and the data sets used. To make the review self- contained, the emergence of deep learning methods towards automatic video classification and the state-of-art deep learning methods are well explained and summarized. Moreover, a clear insight of the newly developed deep learning architectures and the traditional approaches is provided, and the critical challenges based on the benchmarks are highlighted for evaluating the technical progress of these methods. The paper also summarizes the benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation matrices for video classification. Based on the compact, complete, and concise review, the paper proposes new research directions to solve the challenging video classification problem.</p></div></div></div>",

One way to detect the breast cancer is using histopathology images. In recent years deep learning methods are among the methods that have shown high accuracy in detection cancerous tumors in images. In this work different deep learning methods such as Xception, MobileVNet, VGG16 and VGG19 have been used and the results are compared. Two popular datasets in breast cancer have been used.

Besides being able to produce photorealistic images, generative architectures such as GANs and diffusion models have turned out to be very useful for solving inverse problems, providing powerful priors that can be used even with lack of ground truth data, or lack of training data at all.This talk will focus on recent advances in deep models for restoration, touching on aspects such as perception, complexity and priors. I will cover models for supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised and one-shot restoration, in the single- and multi-image case, as well as the generation of multiple \"\"good\"\" solutions that are consistent with the observed data. I will show examples of models learning non-local relationships in the data, along with applications to a variety of data types including optical/radar satellite images and point clouds. I will discuss the implications of these methods on accuracy, perceptual quality and complexity, and I will discuss multimodality as a way to further improve image restoration accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The continuously growing population throughout globe demands an ample food supply, which is one of foremost challenge of smart agriculture. Timely and precise identification of weeds, insects, and diseases in plants are necessary for increased crop yield to satisfy demand for sufficient food supply. With fewer experts in this field, there is a need to develop an automated system for predicting yield, detection of weeds, insects, and diseases in plants. In addition to plants, livestock such as cattle, pigs, and chickens also contribute as major food. Hence, livestock demands precision methods for reducing the mortality rate of livestock by identifying diseases in livestock. Deep learning is one of the upcoming technologies that when combined with image processing promises smart agriculture to be a reality. Various applications of DL for smart agriculture are covered.",

        "abstract": "In essence, smart grids are electrical networks that transmit and distribute electricity in a reliable, effective manner using information and communication technology (ICT). Trust and security are of the utmost importance. False data injection (FDI) attacks are one of the most serious new security problems, and they can drastically raise the price of the energy distribution process. However, rather than smart grid infrastructures, the majority of current research focuses on FDI defenses for conventional electricity networks. By utilizing spatial-temporal correlations between grid components, we create an effective and real-time technique to identify FDI attacks in smart grids called a deep learning framework. We show that the suggested method offers an accurate and dependable solution using realistic simulations based on the smart grid compared to the benchmarked techniques.",

        "abstract": "Studying human postural structure is one of the challenging issues among scholars and physicians. The spine is known as the central axis of the body, and due to various genetic and environmental reasons, it could suffer from deformities leading to physical dysfunction and correspondingly affecting people's quality of life. Radiography is the most common method for detecting these deformities; however, it frequently exposes the patient to X-rays and ionization and consequently increases cancer risk in patients particularly children and pregnant women.The purpose of this research is to provide an entirely safe and non-invasive method to examine the spiral structure and its deformities. Hence, it is attempted to find the exact location of anatomical landmarks on the human back surface, which provides useful and functional information about the status of the human postural structure to the physician. In this study, using Microsoft Kinect sensor, the depth images from the human back surface of 105 people were recorded and, our proposed approach – a deep convolution neural network- was used as a model to estimate the locations of anatomical landmarks. In network architecture, two learning processes, including landmark position and affinity between the two associated landmarks, are successively performed in two separate branches. This is a bottom-up approach; thus, the runtime complexity is considerably reduced, and then the resulting anatomical points are evaluated concerning manual landmarks marked by the operator as the benchmark. Our results showed 86.9% of PDJ and 80% of PCK that demonstrate more effectiveness compared to other methods.",

Typically, one employs a penalty approach to enforce essential boundary conditions, however, the naive approach to this problem becomes unstable for large penalizations. A novel method to compensate this problem is proposed, using a small penalization strength to pre-train the model before the main training on the target penalization strength is conducted. We present numerical evidence that the proposed method is beneficial.",

        "abstract": "For a number of reasons, distributed computing is crucial to machine learning and deep learning models. In the beginning, it makes it possible to train big models that won't fit in a single machine's memory. Second, by distributing the burden over several machines, it expedites the training process. Thirdly, it enables the management of vast amounts of data that may be dispersed across multiple devices or kept remotely. The system can continue processing data even if one machine fails because of distributed computing, which further improves fault tolerance. This chapter summarizes major frameworks Tensorflow, Pytorch, Apache spark Hadoop, and Horovod that are enabling developers to design and implement distributed computing models using large datasets. Some of the challenges faced by the distributed computing models are communication overhead, fault tolerance, load balancing, scalability and security, and the solutions are proposed to overcome the abovementioned challenges.",

        "abstract": "As the number of connected devices grows, the internet of things (IoT) poses new security challenges for network activity monitoring. Due to a lack of security understanding on the side of device producers and end users, the majority of internet of things devices are vulnerable. As a result, virus writers have found them to be great targets for converting them into bots and using them to perform large-scale attacks against a variety of targets. The authors provide deep learning models based on deep reinforcement learning for cyber security in IoT networks in this chapter. The IoT is a potential network that connects both living and nonliving things all around the world. As the popularity of IoT grows, cyber security remains a shortcoming, rendering it exposed to a variety of cyber-attacks. It should be emphasized, however, that while there are numerous DL algorithms presently, the scientific literature does not yet include a comprehensive catalogue of them. This chapter provides a complete list of DL algorithms as well as their many application areas. ",

Computer vision allows machines to visualize and sense the visual world from digital images or videos. Computer vision can be used for face detection, recognition, and emotion detection. There is a growing demand for emotion analysis in the computer vision market. Expressions play an important role in the recognition of emotions for medical sentiment analysis that can be detected by a deep learning model with the help of trained classes. This chapter focuses on emotion recognition and discusses the different algorithms/architecture developed for emotion recognition using deep learning with the data set. Current research and applications based on emotion recognition are also discussed. This chapter can guide beginners in the field of emotion recognition and provide a general understanding of the latest state of art models, as well as guide the researchers looking for directions for future work.",

        "abstract": "Effective landslide hazard prevention requires accurate landslide prediction models, and the data-driven approaches based on deep learning models are gradually becoming a hot research topic. When training deep learning models, it is always preferable to have a large dataset, while most available landslide monitoring data are limited. For data missing or data sparseness problems, conventional interpolation methods based on mathematical knowledge lack mechanism interpretability. This paper proposes that numerical simulations can be used to expand the deep learning dataset we need. Taking the Jiuxianping landslide in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) as the geological background, a finite element numerical model was established, and the landslide displacement time series data were solved considering the boundary conditions of reservoir water level change and precipitation. Next, based on three metrics: Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance, the time series similarity between the displacement data obtained from simulation and data obtained from actual monitoring were verified. Finally, the combined deep learning model was built to predict the displacement of the Jiuxianping landslide. The model was trained on both the simulated and monitored datasets and tested by the last 12 monitored data points. Prediction results with the testing set showed that the models trained using the expanded training set from numerical simulations exhibited lower prediction errors, and the errors had a more concentrated distribution. The results suggest that this landslide displacement prediction method combining numerical simulation and deep learning can solve the problem of inadequate datasets due to low monitoring frequency, as well as provide an interpretation of the physical mechanism for data vacancy filling.",

On one side, we are enjoying the privilege of digitalization. On the other side, security of our information in the internet is the most concerning element. A variety of security mechanisms, namely cryptography, algorithms which provide access to protected information, and authentication including biometric and steganography, provide security to our information in the Internet. In spite of the above mechanisms, recently artificial intelligence (AI) also contributes towards strengthening information security by providing machine learning and deep learning-based security mechanisms. The artificial intelligence (AI) contribution to cyber security is important as it serves as a provoked reaction and a response to hackers' malicious actions. The purpose of this chapter is to survey recent papers which are contributing to information security by using machine learning and deep learning techniques. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nChinese negative information recognition is the key technology of natural language processing. Its core is to recognize the negative relationship in the text according to the negative information theory. The recognition and classification of negative information is an important research hotspot of natural language processing. It is of great significance to the establishment of big data around Chinese semantic recognition, such as information retrieval and text mining. It is also a key step to promote Chinese language recognition. Firstly, this paper studies the expression forms of Chinese negative information in the scene of life, and points out that negative information recognition mainly includes negative trigger word recognition, negative coverage recognition and negative focus recognition; Then, it summarizes the current basic knowledge of deep learning and Chinese negative information recognition, analyzes the working principle of CRF and recurrent neural network RNN model, and analyzes the basic theories of Chinese information recognition, such as Chinese corpus data and text preprocessing technology; Finally, the combination of bidirectional long-term and short-term memory network (bltstmn) and traditional CRF model is used to study Chinese negative information recognition. Theoretical research shows that the combination of bltstmn-crf has better applicability to Chinese negative information recognition, and has better improvement in recognition accuracy and fast recognition. In this paper, the recognition of Chinese negative information based on bltstmn-crf is a form of applying deep learning to natural language processing, which can provide a thinking reference for other deep learning networks in natural language processing. In the follow-up, we will further study the application of deep learning to natural language processing.",

Specifically, the topic has gained more attention after the emergence of deep learning models as a successful tool for automatically classifying videos. In recognition to the importance of video classification task and to summarize the success of deep learning models for this task, this paper presents a very comprehensive and concise review on the topic. There are a number of existing reviews and survey papers related to video classification in the scientific literature. However, the existing review papers are either outdated, and therefore, do not include the recent state-of-art works or they have some limitations. In order to provide an updated and concise review, this paper highlights the key findings based on the existing deep learning models. The key findings are also discussed in a way to provide future research directions. This review mainly focuses on the type of network architecture used, the evaluation criteria to measure the success, and the data sets used. To make the review self- contained, the emergence of deep learning methods towards automatic video classification and the state-of-art deep learning methods are well explained and summarized. Moreover, a clear insight of the newly developed deep learning architectures and the traditional approaches is provided, and the critical challenges based on the benchmarks are highlighted for evaluating the technical progress of these methods. The paper also summarizes the benchmark datasets and the performance evaluation matrices for video classification. Based on the compact, complete, and concise review, the paper proposes new research directions to solve the challenging video classification problem.</p></div></div></div>",

One way to detect the breast cancer is using histopathology images. In recent years deep learning methods are among the methods that have shown high accuracy in detection cancerous tumors in images. In this work different deep learning methods such as Xception, MobileVNet, VGG16 and VGG19 have been used and the results are compared. Two popular datasets in breast cancer have been used. Transfer learning is used for pre-training the structures. In addition, different preprocessing methods is introduced and used to increase the number of images in the dataset.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has significantly advanced several areas of imaging, from image analysis tasks such as classification and segmentation to image restoration tasks. Besides being able to produce photorealistic images, generative architectures such as GANs and diffusion models have turned out to be very useful for solving inverse problems, providing powerful priors that can be used even with lack of ground truth data, or lack of training data at all.This talk will focus on recent advances in deep models for restoration, touching on aspects such as perception, complexity and priors. I will cover models for supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised and one-shot restoration, in the single- and multi-image case, as well as the generation of multiple \"\"good\"\" solutions that are consistent with the observed data. I will show examples of models learning non-local relationships in the data, along with applications to a variety of data types including optical/radar satellite images and point clouds. I will discuss the implications of these methods on accuracy, perceptual quality and complexity, and I will discuss multimodality as a way to further improve image restoration accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCloud failure is one of the critical issues since it can cost millions to the cloud service providers in addition to the loss of productivity being suffered by the industrial users using different cloud-based applications and services. As the cloud system grows larger, the process of failure prediction is still a challenge for both practitioners and academic researchers. In this study, we tackle the challenge of predicting job and task failure using the benchmarking Google Cluster Traces Dataset. We first propose a conceptual model to prepare, construct and evaluate five traditional machine learning algorithms and three variants of the latest deep learning algorithms for predicting job and task failures. We then perform a series of experiments on two datasets; (1) Dataset A for the job failure prediction models and (2) Dataset B for the task failure prediction models. In the case of job failure prediction experiments, we observe that Extreme Gradient Boosting is the best performance with 94.35% accuracy with the F-Score score of 0.9310, 91.92% sensitivity, and 96.07% specificity. For Extreme Gradient Boosting, the disk space request and CPU request are the most important features in determining the outcome of the job prediction. In the case of task failure prediction, we observe that Decision Tree and Random Forest have achieved the highest 89.75% accuracy and 0.9145 for F-Score with 98% sensitivity and 78% specificity. The priority of the task is the most important feature for determining the task prediction outcome for both, the Decision Tree and Random Forest.",

The rapid development and wide use of high-tech have provided strong technical support for the industrial reform of industrial types. The new economic development model has changed the industrial structure in the previous development model, and China's economic development pattern has also made great progress relying on intelligent technology. The long-term and stable development of various industries is linked to the quality of talents in each school. The development of the new era has prompted colleges and universities to improve the level and efficiency of talent training. New advanced technologies have also provided greater space for colleges and universities to innovate teaching concepts and teaching methods. This paper takes the deep learning algorithm as the technical background of the mobile software learning platform, uses the theoretical knowledge of the algorithm to explain the implementation process and the significance of the implementation of the concept of industry education integration in colleges and universities, and carries out simulation analysis on the designed APP, providing help for the further popularization of the concept of industry education integration.",

The frequency of poorly differentiated ADC is relatively low (usually less than 5% among colorectal carcinomas). Histopathological diagnosis based on endoscopic biopsy specimens is currently the most cost effective method to perform as part of colonoscopic screening in average risk patients, and it is an area that could benefit from AI-based tools to aid pathologists in their clinical workflows. In this study, we trained deep learning models to classify poorly differentiated colorectal ADC from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a simply transfer learning method. We evaluated the models on a combination of test sets obtained from five distinct sources, achieving receiver operator curve (ROC) area under the curves (AUCs) in the range of 0.94-0.98.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a recommendation system based on a hybrid learning approach for a personal deep sleep service, called the Customized Deep Sleep Recommender System (CDSRS). Sleep is one of the most important factors for human life in modern society. Optimal sleep contributes to increasing work efficiency and controlling overall well-being. Therefore, a sleep recommendation service is considered a necessary service for modern individuals. Accurate sleep analysis and data are required to provide such a personalized sleep service. However, given the variations in sleep patterns between individuals, there is currently no international standard for sleep. Additionally, service platforms face a cold start problem when dealing with new users. To address these challenges, this study utilizes K-means clustering analysis to define sleep patterns and employs a hybrid learning algorithm to evaluate recommendations by combining user-based and collaborative filtering methods. It also incorporates feedback top-N classification processing for user profile learning and recommendations. The behavior of the study model is as follows. Using personal information received through mobile devices and data, such as snoring, sleep time, movement, and noise collected through AI motion beds, we recommend sleep and receive user evaluations of recommended sleep. This assessment reconstructs the profile and, finally, makes recommendations using top-N classification. The experimental results were evaluated using two absolute error measurement methods: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The research results regarding the hybrid learning methods show 13.2% fewer errors than collaborative filtering (CF) and 10.2% fewer errors than content-based filtering (CBF) on an MSE basis. According to the MAPE, the methods are 14.7% more accurate than the CF model and 9.2% better than the CBF model. These results demonstrate that CDSRS systems can provide more accurate recommendations and customized sleep services to users than CF, CBF, and combination models. As a result, CDSRS, a hybrid learning method, can better reflect a user’s evaluation than traditional methods and can increase the accuracy of recommendations as the number of users increases.",

In our experiments, we extracted features from audio signals, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR), then we classified emotions using many classification algorithms such as machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)) and deep learning algorithms such as (Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)). Our Experiments showed that the MFCC feature extraction method and CNN model obtained the best accuracy result with 95 %, proving the effectiveness of this classification system in recognizing Arabic spoken emotions.",

        "abstract": "Dune mapping is a traditional task for aeolian geomorphologists and has made use of satellite imagery since the 1970s (Breed & Grow, 1979). Labour-intensive manual mapping approaches are increasingly substituted by (semi-)automated ones that apply progressive Machine Learning algorithms (Zheng et al., 2022). Advanced techniques such as neural networks enable the creation of powerful computational models to automatically map dune fields (Shumack et al., 2020; Rubanenko et al., 2021). Globally available satellite imagery datasets and the progression of computational infrastructure and power facilitate the operation of increasingly elaborate models and their application to spatially extensive regions. A lack of training and validation datasets for such dune mapping models and the subjective and time-consuming nature of their creation, however, remains a challenge.We present a framework that uses Deep Learning and different types of satellite imagery to map dune crests. It comprises automated modules to (1) retrieve and pre-process training and prediction data, (2) train a neural network (U-Net; Ronneberger et al., 2015), and (3) identify dune crests in unlabelled target areas applying the trained model. The framework has shown good performance mapping linear dunefields in the Kalahari Desert using a small training and validation dataset (130 labelled 960mx960m tiles).Addressing the lack of global training data, we use our model to explore the possibilities of transfer learning and the universality of regional training datasets. In our main case study, we assess whether a model trained on satellite data of linear dunes in the Kalahari can be applied to map linear dunes in regions containing morphologically similar dunes in the Australian deserts.&#160;Breed, C.

        "abstract": "AbstractMonitoring the depth of unconsciousness during anesthesia is useful in both clinical settings and neuroscience investigations to understand brain mechanisms. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on EEG data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in the EEG signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia EEG setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other BCI applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-MetaNet, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-MetaNet is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We used a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping. Experiments on the office-based anesthesia EEG dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Anes-MetaNet by comparison of existing methods.",

        "abstract": "For a number of reasons, distributed computing is crucial to machine learning and deep learning models. In the beginning, it makes it possible to train big models that won't fit in a single machine's memory. Second, by distributing the burden over several machines, it expedites the training process. Thirdly, it enables the management of vast amounts of data that may be dispersed across multiple devices or kept remotely. The system can continue processing data even if one machine fails because of distributed computing, which further improves fault tolerance. This chapter summarizes major frameworks Tensorflow, Pytorch, Apache spark Hadoop, and Horovod that are enabling developers to design and implement distributed computing models using large datasets. Some of the challenges faced by the distributed computing models are communication overhead, fault tolerance, load balancing, scalability and security, and the solutions are proposed to overcome the abovementioned challenges.",

Due to a lack of security understanding on the side of device producers and end users, the majority of internet of things devices are vulnerable. As a result, virus writers have found them to be great targets for converting them into bots and using them to perform large-scale attacks against a variety of targets. The authors provide deep learning models based on deep reinforcement learning for cyber security in IoT networks in this chapter. The IoT is a potential network that connects both living and nonliving things all around the world. As the popularity of IoT grows, cyber security remains a shortcoming, rendering it exposed to a variety of cyber-attacks. It should be emphasized, however, that while there are numerous DL algorithms presently, the scientific literature does not yet include a comprehensive catalogue of them. This chapter provides a complete list of DL algorithms as well as their many application areas. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractLinking phenotypes to specific gene expression profiles is an extremely important problem in biology, which has been approached mainly by correlation methods or, more fundamentally, by studying the effects of gene perturbations. However, genome-wide perturbations involve extensive experimental efforts, which may be prohibitive for certain organisms. On the other hand, the characterization of the various phenotypes frequently requires an expert’s subjective interpretation, such as a histopathologist’s description of tissue slide images in terms of complex visual features (e.g. ‘acinar structures’). In this paper, we use Deep Learning to eliminate the inherent subjective nature of these visual histological features and link them to genomic data, thus establishing a more precisely quantifiable correlation between transcriptomes and phenotypes. Using a dataset of whole slide images with matching gene expression data from 39 normal tissue types, we first developed a Deep Learning tissue classifier with an accuracy of 94%. Then we searched for genes whose expression correlates with features inferred by the classifier and demonstrate that Deep Learning can automatically derive visual (phenotypical) features that are well correlated with the transcriptome and therefore biologically interpretable. As we are particularly concerned with interpretability and explainability of the inferred histological models, we also develop visualizations of the inferred features and compare them with gene expression patterns determined by immunohistochemistry. This can be viewed as a first step toward bridging the gap between the level of genes and the cellular organization of tissues.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationAccurate prediction of protein structures is crucial for understanding protein function, stability, and interactions, with far-reaching implications in drug discovery and protein engineering. As the fields of structural bioinformatics and artificial intelligence continue to converge, a standardized model for protein structure prediction is still yet to be seen as even large models like AlphaFold continue to change architectures. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review highlighting the latest advancements and challenges in deep learning-based structure prediction, as well as a benchmark system for structure prediction and visualization of amino acid protein sequences.ResultsWe present ProteiNN, a Transformer-based model for end-to-end single-sequence protein structure prediction, motivated by the need for accurate and efficient methods to decipher protein structures and their roles in biological processes and a system to perform prediction on user-input protein sequences. The model leverages the transformer architecture’s powerful representation learning capabilities to predict protein secondary and tertiary structures directly from integer-encoded amino acid sequences. Our results demonstrate that ProteiNN is effective in predicting secondary structures, though further improvements are necessary to enhance the model’s performance in predicting higher-level structures. This work thus showcases the potential of transformer-based architectures in structure prediction and lays the foundation for future research in structural bioinformatics and related fields.Availability and implementationThe source code of ProteiNN is available athttps://github.com/danielathome19/ProteiNN-Structure-Predictor.",

Various studies have been proposed for classifying frog species, but most recordings are assumed to have only a single species. In this study, a method to classify multiple frog species in an audio clip is presented. To be specific, continuous frog recordings are first cropped into audio clips (10 seconds). Then, various time-frequency representations are generated for each 10-s recording. Next, instead of using traditional hand-crafted features, a deep learning algorithm is used to find the most important feature. Finally, a binary relevance based multi-label classification approach is proposed to classify simultaneously vocalizing frog species with our proposed features. Experimental results show that our proposed features extracted using deep learning can achieve better classification performance when compared to hand-crafted features for frog call classification.",

        "abstract": "The efficient placement of wind turbines relies on strategic assessment of local wind speed. Recentstudies highlight the crucial role of spatial resolution in accurately forecasting wind speed andestimating the associated wind energy potential [1].\nHowever, climate models typically fail to provide the spatial data resolution necessary for preciseenergy resource assessment. To address this challenge, various downscaling methods have beenproposed to infer high-resolution data from coarser resolution data. Notably, image super-resolutionmethods, a class of image processing techniques originally developed in computer vision to enhancethe resolution of natural images, have emerged as a promising approach for statistical downscaling. By interpreting gridded data as images, these techniques are amenable to increasing the spatial resolution of climate [3] and weather data [2].\nWe provide a comprehensive benchmark to compare the performance of various state-of-the-art imagesuperresolution models on weather data, such as ERA5 reanalysis data. The benchmark ranges frominterpolation baselines to all prominent deep learning based models, including a CNN-based model,an attention-based model and a spatio-temporal model.\n&#160;\n[1] Jung, C. and Schindler, D.

        "abstract": "Ionospheric sporadic E layers (Es) are intense plasma irregularities between 80 and 130&#8201;km&#160;in altitude and are generally unpredictable. Reconstructing the morphology of sporadic E layers is not only essential for understanding the nature of ionospheric irregularities and many other atmospheric coupling systems, but is also useful for solving a broad range of demands for reliable radio communication of many sectors reliant on ionosphere-dependent decision-making. Despite the efforts of many empirical and theoretical models, a predictive algorithm with both high accuracy and high efficiency is still lacking. Here we introduce a new approach for Sporadic E Layer Forecast using Artificial Neural Networks (SELF-ANN). The prediction engine is trained by fusing observational data from multiple sources, including a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset, Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO) measurements, and integrated data from OMNIWeb. The results show that the model can effectively reconstruct the morphology of the ionospheric E layer with intraseasonal variability by learning complex patterns. The model obtains good performance and generalization capability by applying multiple evaluation criteria. The random forest algorithm used for preliminary processing shows that local time, altitude, longitude, and latitude are significantly essential for forecasting the E-layer region. Extensive evaluations based on ground-based observations demonstrate the superior utility of the model in dealing with unknown information. The presented framework will help us better understand the nature of the ionospheric irregularities, which is a fundamental challenge in upper-atmospheric and ionospheric physics. Moreover, the proposed SELF-ANN can make a significant contribution to the development of the prediction of ionospheric irregularities in the E layer, particularly when the formation mechanisms and evolution processes of the Es layer are not well understood.",

These raw time series data are then plotted into candlestick charts to make an image dataset for studying the stock market. Next, the method extracts high-dimensional features from candlestick charts through an autoencoder. After that, K-means is used to cluster these high-dimensional features. Finally, we choose one stock from each category according to the Sharpe ratio and a low-risk, high-return portfolio is obtained. Extensive experiments are conducted on stocks in the Chinese stock market for evaluation.

        "abstract": "Repair and maintenance of underwater structures as well as marine science rely heavily on the results of underwater object detection, which is a crucial part of the image processing workflow. Although many computer vision-based approaches have been presented, no one has yet developed a system that reliably and accurately detects and categorizes objects and animals found in the deep sea. This is largely due to obstacles that scatter and absorb light in an underwater setting. With the introduction of deep learning, scientists have been able to address a wide range of issues, including safeguarding the marine ecosystem, saving lives in an emergency, preventing underwater disasters, and detecting, spooring, and identifying underwater targets. However, the benefits and drawbacks of these deep learning systems remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the dataset that has been utilized in underwater object detection and to present a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms employed for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "The increased credit card defaulters have forced the companies to think carefully before the approval of credit applications. Credit card companies usually use their judgment to determine whether a credit card should be issued to the customer satisfying certain criteria. Some machine learning algorithms have also been used to support the decision. The main objective of this paper is to build a deep learning model based on the UCI (University of California, Irvine) data sets, which can support the credit card approval decision. Secondly, the performance of the built model is compared with the other two traditional machine learning algorithms: logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that the overall performance of our deep learning model is slightly better than that of the other two models.",

        "abstract": "Moving object detection and tracking is the process of identifying and locating the class objects such as people, vehicle, toy, and human faces in the video sequences more precisely without background disturbances. It is the first and foremost step in any kind of video analytics applications, and it is greatly influencing the high-level abstractions such as classification and tracking. Traditional methods are easily affected by the background disturbances and achieve poor results. With the advent of deep learning, it is possible to improve the results with high level features. The deep learning model helps to get more useful insights about the events in the real world. This chapter introduces the deep convolutional neural network and reviews the deep learning models used for moving object detection. This chapter also discusses the parameters involved and metrics used to assess the performance of moving object detection in deep learning model. Finally, the chapter is concluded with possible recommendations for the benefit of research community. ",

A dynamic shift from a manual mass production model to an integrated automated industry towards automation includes several stages. Along with the boost in the economy, manufacturers also face several challenges, including several aspects. Machine Learning can prove to be an essential tool and optimize the production process, respond quickly to the changes and market demand respectively, predict certain aspects of the particular industry to improve performance, maintain machine health and other aspects. Machine Learning technology can prove its effectiveness when applied to a specific issue in the sector— such as filtering out the primary use cases of Machine Learning manufacturing specifically, 'Predictive quality and yield' and 'Predictive maintenance.' Supervised Machine Learning and Unsupervised Machine Learning may provide the accuracy to predict the outputs and the underlying patterns.",

Among different natural language processing domains, dubbing is one of the challenging tasks. Deep learning-based methodologies for dubbing will translate unknown language audio into meaningful words. This chapter provides a detailed study on the recent deep learning models in literature for dubbing. Deep learning models for dubbing can be categorized based on the feature representation as audio, visual, and multimodal features. More models are prevailing for English language, and a few techniques are available for Indian languages. In this chapter, the authors provide an end-to-end solution to predict the lip movements and translate them into natural language. This study also covers the recent enhancements in deep learning for natural language processing. Also, the future directions for the automated dubbing process domain are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common chronic disorder with a high incidence rate that disproportionately affects elderly people. Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly popular in recent years, resulting in notable developments and innovations in medical imaging. Consequently, deep learning has emerged as the preferred approach for analyzing medical visuals, particularly in the realm of Alzheimer's disease detection. In this chapter, the authors performed a comparative analysis of various DL models such as convolutional neural networks, DenseNet, ResNet, EfficientNet, etc., which have shown some groundbreaking results for AD disease detection. Also, they focused on investigating data collection and feature extraction techniques pertinent to AD. In addition, they further discussed briefly the deep learning models for AD detection. This not only increases hope for the advancement of AD research and therapy but also highlights how deep learning can revolutionize the field of medical image analysis and illness identification.",

It reviews methodological considerations relevant to gauging the success of the DoGMA’s defense as an analysis of deep learning’s success. It motivates a choice to focus on rationality rather than intelligence, given concerns about the history of psychometric research from which many intelligence-based approaches descend. It considers biases that could distort the evaluation such as anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. It particularly focuses on the way that nativist assumptions may be supported by a problematic bias, dubbed “anthropofabulation,” which combines anthropocentrism with confabulation about the superiority of average human performance.",

        "abstract": "The communication through the wireless environment is open, which completely differs from the wired. This open environment communication can be accessed by users including illegitimate and thus increases the vulnerability for malicious attacks. For that reason, motivation comes to study about the different possible security challenges, threats, and to devise powerful, efficient, and improved required solution to improve the various security vulnerabilities. This chapter presents the challenges regarding security and the security requirement in the wireless type communication. The research performs the analysis of deep learning for detecting malicious websites. These websites are responsible to disrupt normal system working and can control the complete system and its resources by installing malware on to the respective machine. To elucidate the constructive and effective way towards the detection of malicious URL, the study uses convolutional neural networks. ",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the acquisition of different deep learning (DL) algorithms is becoming an advantage in the healthcare sector. Algorithms like CNN (Convolution Neural Network) are used to detect diseases and classify the images of various disease abnormalities. It has been proven that CNN shows high performance in the classification of diseases, so deep learning can remove doubts that occur in the healthcare sector. DL is also used in the reconstruction of various medical diagnoses images like Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. CNN is used to map input image data to reference image data, and this process is known as the registration of images using deep learning. DL is used to extract secrets in the healthcare sector. CNN has many hidden layers in the network so that prediction and analysis can be made accurately. Deep learning has many applications in the healthcare system, like the detection of cancer, gene selection, tumor detection, recognition of human activities, the outbreak of infectious diseases, etc. DL has become famous in the field of healthcare due to its open data source. In the case of the small dataset, CNN becomes an advantage as it does not provide an excellent way to statistical importance. Deep Learning is a technique that includes the basis of ANN (Artificial neural networks), appears as a robust tool for machine learning, and encourages recasting artificial intelligence. Deep learning architecture has more than two hidden layers, as in ANN; it is only one or two. Therefore, this chapter represents a survey of the role of deep learning in the healthcare industry with its challenges and future scope.<br>",

        "abstract": "Repair and maintenance of underwater structures as well as marine science rely heavily on the results of underwater object detection, which is a crucial part of the image processing workflow. Although many computer vision-based approaches have been presented, no one has yet developed a system that reliably and accurately detects and categorizes objects and animals found in the deep sea. This is largely due to obstacles that scatter and absorb light in an underwater setting. With the introduction of deep learning, scientists have been able to address a wide range of issues, including safeguarding the marine ecosystem, saving lives in an emergency, preventing underwater disasters, and detecting, spooring, and identifying underwater targets. However, the benefits and drawbacks of these deep learning systems remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the dataset that has been utilized in underwater object detection and to present a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms employed for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 (coronavirus) is an ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in mid-December 2019 in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China and by now has spread throughout the planet with more than 75.5 million confirmed cases and more than 1.67 million deaths. With limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in medical facilities, it is important to develop and implement an automatic detection system as an alternative diagnosis option for COVID-19 detection that can used on a commercial scale. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can help in determining COVID-19 virus with Chest X-ray Images. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural network for image analysis and classification. In this research, we have proposed a deep convolutional neural network trained on five open access datasets with binary output: Normal and Covid. The performance of the model is compared with four pre-trained convolutional neural network- based models (COVID-Net, ResNet18, ResNet and MobileNet-V2) and it has been seen that the proposed model provides better accuracy on the validation set as compared to the other four pre-trained models. This research work provides promising results which can be further improvise and implement on a commercial scale.",

        "abstract": "Dilation of biliary tree can be an indicator of several diseases such as stones, tumors, benign strictures, and some cases cancer. This dilation can be due to many reasons such as gallstones, inflammation of the bile ducts, trauma, injury, severe liver damage. Automatic measurement of the biliary tree in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is helpful to assist hepatobiliary surgeons for minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, we proposed a model to segment biliary tree MRI images using a Fully Convolutional Neural (FCN) network. Based on the extracted area, seven features that include Entropy, standard deviation, RMS, kurtosis, skewness, Energy and maximum are computed. A database of images from King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) is used in this work, containing 800 MRI images; 400 cases with normal biliary tree; and 400 images with dilated biliary tree labeled by surgeons. Once the features are extracted, four classifiers (Multi-Layer perceptron neural network, support vector machine, k-NN and decision tree) are applied to predict the status of patient in terms of biliary tree (normal or dilated). All classifiers show high accuracy in terms of Area Under Curve except support vector machine. The contributions of this work include introducing a fully convolutional network for biliary tree segmentation, additionally scientifically correlate the extracted features with the status of biliary tree (normal or dilated) that have not been previously investigated in the literature from MRI images for biliary tree status determinations.",

        "abstract": "Deep artificial neural network applications to robotic systems have seen a surge of study due to advancements in deep learning over the past 10 years. The ability of robots to explain the descriptions of their decisions and beliefs leads to a collaboration with the human race. The intensity of the challenges increases as robotics moves from lab to the real-world scenario. Existing robotic control algorithms find it extremely difficult to master the wide variety seen in real-world contexts. The robots have now been developed and advanced to such an extent that they can be useful in our day-to-day lives. All this has been possible because of improvisation of the algorithmic techniques and enhanced computation powers. The majority of traditional machine learning techniques call for parameterized models and functions that must be manually created, making them unsuitable for many robotic jobs. The pattern recognition paradigm may be switched from the combined learning of statistical representations, labelled classifiers, to the joint learning of manmade features and analytical classifiers.",

Through the internet, the IoT makes it possible for machines and gadgets to share signals. Using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to manage and regulate the communications between various equipment based on intelligent decisions is made possible by the internet of things (IoT) technology. Data collection devices can be fundamentally altered to “lock in” to the best sensing data with regard to a user-defined cost function or design constraint by utilizing inverse design and machine learning techniques. By allowing low-cost and small sensor implementations developed through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes, a new generation of intelligence sensing systems reduces the data load while significantly enhancing sensing capabilities. Machine learning-enabled computational sensors can encourage the development of widely distributed applications that leverage the internet of things to build robust sensing networks that have an influence across a variety of industries.",

In the last few years, an explosive growth has been seen in the dimension and structure of data. There are several difficulties faced by conventional ML algorithms while dealing with such highly voluminous and unstructured big data. The modern ML tools are designed and used to deal with all sorts of complexities of data. Deep learning (DL) is one of the modern ML tools which are commonly used to find the hidden structure and cohesion among these large data sets by giving proper training in parallel platforms with intelligent optimization techniques to further analyze and interpret the data for future prediction and classification. This article focuses on the use of DL tools and software which are used in past couple of years in various areas and especially in the area of healthcare applications. ",

        "abstract": "Studying human postural structure is one of the challenging issues among scholars and physicians. The spine is known as the central axis of the body, and due to various genetic and environmental reasons, it could suffer from deformities leading to physical dysfunction and correspondingly affecting people's quality of life. Radiography is the most common method for detecting these deformities; however, it frequently exposes the patient to X-rays and ionization and consequently increases cancer risk in patients particularly children and pregnant women.The purpose of this research is to provide an entirely safe and non-invasive method to examine the spiral structure and its deformities. Hence, it is attempted to find the exact location of anatomical landmarks on the human back surface, which provides useful and functional information about the status of the human postural structure to the physician. In this study, using Microsoft Kinect sensor, the depth images from the human back surface of 105 people were recorded and, our proposed approach – a deep convolution neural network- was used as a model to estimate the locations of anatomical landmarks. In network architecture, two learning processes, including landmark position and affinity between the two associated landmarks, are successively performed in two separate branches. This is a bottom-up approach; thus, the runtime complexity is considerably reduced, and then the resulting anatomical points are evaluated concerning manual landmarks marked by the operator as the benchmark. Our results showed 86.9% of PDJ and 80% of PCK that demonstrate more effectiveness compared to other methods.",

Analyzing sentiments from these data automatically is considered an important challenge. Several machine learning algorithms are implemented to check the opinions from large data sets. A lot of research has been undergone in understanding machine learning approaches to analyze sentiments. Machine learning mainly depends on the data required for model building, and hence, suitable feature exactions techniques also need to be carried. In this chapter, several deep learning approaches, its challenges, and future issues will be addressed. Deep learning techniques are considered important in predicting the sentiments of users. This chapter aims to analyze the deep-learning techniques for predicting sentiments and understanding the importance of several approaches for mining opinions and determining sentiment polarity. ",

As compared to traditional static or induction motor loads, these inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit different behavior. Then, conventional dynamic load modeling with ZIP and induction motors (ZIP + IM) is no longer adequate to address the current load characteristic transitions. Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) has developed the composite load model with distributed generation (CMPLDWG) to accurately represent static load, induction motors, and IBRs. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to estimate the CMPLDWG model’s posterior distributions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using an IEEE 39-bus test system. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately and efficiently estimate the parameters’ posterior distributions.</div>",

In this paper, we present\na graph-based, deep and flexible data representation method using\nfeature propagation as an internal filtering step.

In each layer, the nonlinear data representation and the\nunknown linear model are jointly estimated with a closed form solution.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on semi-supervised classification tasks\nusing six public image datasets.

Various studies have been proposed for classifying frog species, but most recordings are assumed to have only a single species. In this study, a method to classify multiple frog species in an audio clip is presented. To be specific, continuous frog recordings are first cropped into audio clips (10 seconds). Then, various time-frequency representations are generated for each 10-s recording. Next, instead of using traditional hand-crafted features, a deep learning algorithm is used to find the most important feature. Finally, a binary relevance based multi-label classification approach is proposed to classify simultaneously vocalizing frog species with our proposed features. Experimental results show that our proposed features extracted using deep learning can achieve better classification performance when compared to hand-crafted features for frog call classification.",

        "abstract": "Quantifying the error of predictions in earth system models is just as important as the quality of the predictions themselves. While machine learning methods become better by the day in emulating weather and climate forecasting systems, they are rarely used operationally. Two reasons for this are poor handling of extreme events and a lack of uncertainty quantification. The poor handling of extreme events can mainly be attributed to loss functions emphasizing accurate prediction of mean outcomes. Since extreme events are not frequent in climate and weather applications, capturing them accurately is not a natural consequence of minimizing such a loss. Uncertainty quantification for numerical weather prediction usually proceeds through creating an ensemble of predictions. The machine learning domain has adapted this to some extent, creating machine learning ensembles, with multiple architectures trained on the same data or the same architecture trained on altered datasets. Nevertheless, few approaches currently exist for tuning a deep learning ensemble.&#160;We introduce a new approach using a generative neural network, similar to those employed in adversarial learning, but we replace the discriminator with a new loss function. This gives us the control over the statistical properties the generator should learn and increases the stability of the training process immensely. By generating a prediction ensemble during training, we can tune ensemble properties such as variance or skewness in addition to the mean. Early results of this approach will be demonstrated using simple 1D experiments, showing the advantage over classically trained neural networks. Especially the task of predicting extremes and the added value of ensemble predictions will be highlighted. Additionally, predictions of a Lorenz-96 system are demonstrated to show the skill in forecasting chaotic systems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationComparing the human genome to the genomes of closely related mammalian species has been a powerful tool for discovering functional elements in the human genome. Millions of conserved elements have been discovered. However, understanding the functional roles of these elements still remain a challenge, especially in noncoding regions. In particular, it is still unclear why these elements are evolutionarily conserved and what kind of functional elements are encoded within these sequences.ResultsWe present a deep learning framework, called DeepCons, to uncover potential functional elements within conserved sequences. DeepCons is a convolutional neural net (CNN) that receives a short segment of DNA sequence as input and outputs the probability of the sequence of being evolutionary conserved. DeepCons utilizes hundreds of convolution kernels to detect features within DNA sequences, and automatically learns these kernels after training the CNN model using 887,577 conserved elements and a similar number of nonconserved elements in the human genome. On a balanced test dataset, DeepCons can achieve an accuracy of 75% in determining whether a sequence element is conserved or not, and the area under the ROC curve of 0.83, based on information from the human genome alone. We further investigate the properties of the learned kernels. Some kernels are directly related to well-known regulatory motifs corresponding to transcription factors. Many kernels show positional biases relative to transcriptional start sites or transcription end sites. But most of discovered kernels do not correspond to any known functional element, suggesting that they might represent unknown categories of functional elements. We also utilize DeepCons to annotate how changes at each individual nucleotide might impact the conservation properties of the surrounding sequences.AvailabilityThe source code of DeepCons and all the learned convolution kernels in motif format is publicly available online athttps://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepCons.Contactxhx@ics.uci.edu",

But to analyze it, the technologies used of machine learning are not so convincing and thus it is high time to switch to a sub-domain of machine learning called deep learning, which has gained popularity because of its accuracy in processing and analyzing high-dimensional data. The convergence of deep learning with geospatial data analytics shall prove to be a boon to those who actually has a need to predict specific outputs over geospatial data. In this paper, we have presented some geospatial data generated using the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) technology and proposed ways to implement deep learning over these data. GIS technology is a mapping technology which signifies high-dimensional geospatial data and our aim is to propose a model where GIS converges with highly efficient deep neural networks such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network). We have provided geospatial as well as statistical results in this paper to visualize practically the GIS technology. This paper further provides future scope of the proposed model which shall present the challenges that needs to be tackled in future and its applicability in many relevant domains.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis abstract discusses the application of time series analysis in predicting the stock market trends in Indian financial market. While short-term market forecasting can be challenging due to the complexity and emotional factors involved, long-term trends can be effectively studied using data science techniques such as statistical and analytical tools. In the past, predicting stock market changes has been difficult due to the intricate nature of financial markets and the influence of investor emotions. However, the use of data science methods like machine learning and deep learning has gained popularity, particularly because long-term stock market patterns often exhibit a more predictable trajectory. In a recent study it has found that time series analysis is a successful data science approach for uncovering patterns and trends in the stock market. By utilizing Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models is one of the promising methods for forecasting future market movements based on historical data. Additionally, exploring the connections between different stocks can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. Investigating these linkages may reveal essential details about market trends and potential investment prospects. It is expected that further research and development in this field will advance stock market analysis and forecasting, with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and supervised machine learning advancements in data science playing a significant role in this progress. Despite the difficulties that come with stock market forecasting, the development of data science approaches has allowed for major breakthroughs in this area. Scholars have made significant progress thanks in large part to the use of statistical and analytical techniques. The analysis and forecasting of the stock market are positioned to further expand as research and development activities continue, offering useful information to experts and investors alike. These developments in stock market analysis and prediction are anticipated to be greatly aided by the ongoing investigation of cutting-edge data science approaches like machine learning and deep learning. The potential benefits of this continuous development include providing stakeholders with crucial information that will enable them to make wise decisions in the financial markets.",

        "abstract": "Bury et al. (2021) present a powerful approach to anticipating tipping points based on deep learning that not only substantially outperforms traditional early warning indicators, but also classifies the type of bifurcation that may lie ahead. However, deep learning methods are notorious for sometimes exhibiting unintended behavior, and we show that this is also the case here. In particular, we find that the method did not extract features generic enough to classify stationary AR(1) processes that have not been detrended (or have been detrended using a Gaussian filter) as approaching no bifurcation. This suggests that using the same type of detrending as done during the training phase of the deep learning method is required for the method to work in practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article will show you a method for converting 2d images into 3d bounding boxes. The idea is to split the task into two steps. Firstly, we use neural network to output 3D object features displayed in 2D images. Then, we combine the boundary information of 2D objects in the images to generate geometric constraints on 3D objects, so as to get a complete 3D boundary box. In the first step, we defined an innovative loss function called combined_orientation_loss. This loss function took into account both the cosine distance and Euclidean distance, so that the length of the direction vector could also be reflected in the loss, which could enhance the sensitivity of the model to the prediction accuracy. In the second step, we return to the dimensions of 3D objects, which are relatively stable and therefore suitable for predicting a wide range of object types. Combining these two steps and the translation constraints of the object in the 2D image, we can accurately and stably restore its 3D border shape. We evaluated our approach on the KITTI target detection benchmark, including the official measure of 3D direction estimates and the accuracy of the resulting 3D bounding box. In the case of low calculation requirements achieved good results.",

Various activation functions (Leaky ReLU, DReLU, SELU) were used in order to investigate performance. Also, the performanceof a lightweight attention module (squeeze-and-excitation) was evaluated.

        "abstract": "Computation of the critical point of complex fluid mixtures is an\nimportant part of thermodynamic phase behaviour computations. While\nalgorithms for these calculations are well established, they are often\nslow when the number of constituting components is large. In this work,\nwe propose a new procedure to significantly accelerate critical point\ncalculations by leveraging deep neural network (DNN) models. A DNN model\nfor critical point predictions of a given mixture is first trained based\non the critical points of such a mixture with various compositions. Such\na DNN model is then used to initialize both of the commonly used\nalgorithms for mixture critical point calculations: root finding and\nglobal minimization. We demonstrate that when using the DNN-based\npredictions to initialize the root-finding-based and optimization-based\nalgorithms, we can achieve 50-90% and 80-90% reductions in the number\nof required iterations, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of future\nmovement of stock prices has been a subject matter of many research work. On\none hand, we have proponents of the Efficient Market Hypothesis who claim that\nstock prices cannot be predicted, on the other hand, there are propositions\nillustrating that, if appropriately modeled, stock prices can be predicted with\na high level of accuracy. There is also a gamut of literature on technical\nanalysis of stock prices where the objective is to identify patterns in stock\nprice movements and profit from it. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach\nfor stock price prediction using five deep learning-based regression models. We\nselect the NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India,\nover a period of December 29, 2014 to July 31, 2020.  Based on the NIFTY data during December 29, 2014\nto December 28, 2018, we build two regression models using <i>convolutional\nneural networks</i> (CNNs), and three regression models using <i>long-and-short-term\nmemory</i> (LSTM) networks for predicting the <i>open</i> values of the NIFTY\n50 index records for the period December 31, 2018 to July 31, 2020. We adopted\na multi-step prediction technique with <i>walk-forward validation</i>.  The parameters of the five deep learning\nmodels are optimized using the grid-search technique so that the validation\nlosses of the models stabilize with an increasing number of epochs in the model\ntraining, and the training and validation accuracies converge. Extensive\nresults are presented on various metrics for all the proposed regression models.\nThe results indicate that while both CNN and LSTM-based regression models are\nvery accurate in forecasting the NIFTY 50 <i>open</i> values, the CNN model\nthat previous one week’s data as the input is the fastest in its execution. On\nthe other hand, the encoder-decoder convolutional LSTM model uses the previous\ntwo weeks’ data as the input is found to be the most accurate in its\nforecasting results.",

        "abstract": "The problem of selecting the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) that maximizes the system throughput, known as link adaptation, has been investigated extensively, especially for IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standards. Recently, deep learning has widely been adopted as an efficient solution to this problem. However, in model failure cases, predicting a higher-rate MCS can result in a failed transmission. In this case, retransmission is required, which largely degrades the system throughput. To address this issue, we formulate the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) problem as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. The proposed formulation allows more control over what the model predicts in failure cases. In this context, we propose a simple, yet powerful, loss function to reduce the number of retransmissions due to higher-rate MCS classification errors. Since wireless channels change significantly due to the surrounding environment, a huge dataset is generated to cover all possible propagation conditions. However, to reduce training complexity, we train the CNN model using part of the dataset. The effect of different subdataset selection criteria on the classification accuracy is studied. It is shown that some criteria for dataset selection consistently behave better than others. To confirm the performance, we applied the proposed model for adapting the IEEE 802.11ax standard in outdoor propagation scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed loss function reduces up to 50% of retransmissions compared to traditional loss functions. Finally, we propose an optimal subdataset selection criterion.",

The classification of fNIRS data in\nrelation to conscious activity holds significance for advancing our\nunderstanding of the brain and facilitating the development of\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many researchers have turned to deep\nlearning to tackle the classification challenges inherent in fNIRS data\ndue to its strong generalization and robustness.

Machine learning techniques are increasingly used to identify naturally occurring AMPs, but there is a dearth of purely computational methods to design novel effective AMPs, which would speed AMP development. We collected a large database, Giant Repository of AMP Activities (GRAMPA), containing AMP sequences and associated MICs. We designed a convolutional neural network to perform combined classification and regression on peptide sequences to quantitatively predict AMP activity against Escherichia coli. Our predictions outperformed the state of the art at AMP classification and were also effective at regression, for which there were no publicly available comparisons. We then used our model to design novel AMPs and experimentally demonstrated activity of these AMPs against the pathogens E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.

First, 1200 dynamic features representing the percentage of euclidean distances between facial fiducial points in the first frame and facial fiducial points in the last frame are extracted from image sequences.

Since a conventional evaluation contains human interpretation, luck and uncertainties, a variety of ranges of the reserves are often inferred from different interpreters given even identical dataset and conditions. As a consequence, there are differences between actual reserves and evaluated reserves. In this paper, using certain cases of how much actual reserves are deviated from interpreted reserves, deep learning is applied to mitigate such differences for unknown data which do not have actual reserves information. We find that our approach stably predicts the actual model by decreasing the misfit between the human and actual in comparison with the validation data on our workflow. The approach could be used to de-risk reserves estimation without changing traditional way of interpretations.",

Active learning is poised to be a solution for drug discovery in low-data regimes. In active learning, a model is updated iteratively by taking multiple smaller screening steps, instead of suggesting many molecules at once with a single model for traditional ‘one-shot’ screening. This iterative approach aims to improve models during the screening process and can adjust course along the way. Despite pioneering applications, it is currently unclear how active learning holds up to traditional approaches and what the best strategies are for prospective drug discovery applications. In this study, we combine six active learning strategies with two distinct deep learning methods and analyse their performance on three large-scale libraries. For each strategy, we investigate its capacity to discover bioactive hits and explore the chemical space. We found that active learning can achieve up to a six-fold improvement in hit retrieval compared to traditional methods in a low-data scenario. The strategy to acquire new molecules at each cycle resulted to be the primary driver of performance, and it determined the ‘molecular journey’ throughout screening cycles. Finally, we show that active learning can quickly compensate for a lack of molecular diversity in the starting set. These results advocate for the adoption of active deep learning to accelerate drug discovery in low-data regimes.",

It is currently unclear how active learning holds up to traditional approaches and what the best strategies are for prospective drug discovery applications. In this study, we lay the first foundations for the prospective use of active deep learning in low-data scenarios where only dozens of training molecules are available to screen hundreds of thousands of molecules. Our systematic study combines six active learning strategies, two deep learning architectures, and three large-scale molecular libraries. We highlight that active learning can achieve up to a six-fold improvement in hit discovery compared to traditional methods. How molecules are chosen for the next iteration proved to be the primary driver of performance – it is more important than the chosen network architecture in determining the ‘molecular journey’ in the chemical space. Remarkably, active learning showed to quickly compensate for a lack of molecular diversity in the starting set, allowing to efficiently chart unexplored structural motifs.

        "abstract": "The distribution of energy dose from Lu177 radiotherapy can be estimated by convolving an image of a time-integrated activity distribution with a dose voxel kernel (DVK) consisting of different types of tissues. This fast and inacurate approximation is inappropriate for personalized dosimetry as it neglects tissue heterogenity. The latter can be calculated using different imaging techniques such as CT and SPECT combined with a time consuming monte-carlo simulation. The aim of this study is, for the first time, an estimation of DVKs from CT-derived density kernels (DK) via deep learning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed CNN achieved, on the test set, a mean intersection over union (IOU) of =0.86 after 308 epochs and a corresponding mean squared error (MSE) =1.24⋅10−4. This generalization ability shows that the trained CNN can indeed learn the difficult transfer function from DK to DVK. Future work will evaluate DVKs estimated by CNNs with full monte-carlo simulations of a whole body CT to predict patient specific voxel dose maps.",

The outdoor scene like urban street scene is composing of image with depth having greater variety than iconic object image. The semantic segmentation is an important task for autonomous driving and mobile robotics applications because it introduces enormous information need for safe navigation and complex reasoning. This paper introduces a model for classification all pixel’s image and predicates the right object that contains this pixel. This model adapts famous network image classification VGG16 with fully convolution network (FCN-8) and transfer learned representation by fine tuning for doing segmentation. Skip Architecture is added between layers to combine coarse, semantic, and local appearance information to generate accurate segmentation. This model is robust and efficiency because it efficient consumes low memory and faster inference time for testing and training on Camvid dataset. The output module is designed by using a special computer equipped by GPU memory NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 6G, and programmed by using python 3.7 programming language. The proposed system reached an accuracy 0.8804 and MIOU 73% on Camvid dataset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paper addresses the problem of part-of-speech (POS) tagging for Malayalam tweets. The conversational style of posts/tweets/text in social media data poses a challenge in using general POS tagset for tagging the text. For the current work, a tagset was designed that contains 17 coarse tags and 9915 tweets were tagged manually for experiment and evaluation. The tagged data were evaluated using sequential deep learning methods like recurrent neural network (RNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). The training of the model was performed on the tagged tweets, at word level and character level. The experiments were evaluated using measures like precision, recall, f1-measure, and accuracy. During the experiment, it was found that the GRU-based deep learning sequential model at word level gave the highest f1-measure of 0.9254; at character-level, the BLSTM-based deep learning sequential model gave the highest f1-measure of 0.8739. To choose the suitable number of hidden states, we varied it as 4, 16, 32, and 64, and performed training for each. It was observed that the increase in hidden states improved the tagger model. This is an initial work to perform Malayalam Twitter data POS tagging using deep learning sequential models.",

        "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), memory and cognitive abilities deteriorate, affecting the capacity to do basic activities. In and around brain cells, aberrant amyloid and tau protein accumulation is believed to cause it. Amyloid deposits create plaques surrounding brain cells, whereas tau deposits form tangles inside brain cells. The plagues and tangles harm healthy brain cells, causing shrinkage. This damage seems to be occurring in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory formation. There are presently no methods that provide the most accurate outcomes. The current techniques do not identify AD early. The proposed DL-EDAD method achieves excellent clustering using CNN with E-GKFCM (enhanced gaussian kernel fuzzy c-means clustering). The E-GKFCM utilizes an elbow method to determine the number of clusters in a dataset. Unlike other medical pictures, brain scans are extremely sensitive.",

        "abstract": "Control systems require maintenance in the form of tuning their parameters in order to maximize their performance in the face of process changes in minerals processing circuits. This work focuses on using deep reinforcement learning to train an agent to perform this maintenance continuously. A generic simulation of a first-order process with a time delay, controlled by a proportional-integral controller, was used as the training environment. Domain randomization in this environment was used to aid in generalizing the agent to unseen conditions on a physical circuit. Proximal policy optimization was used to train the agent, and hyper-parameter optimization was performed to select the optimal agent neural network size and training algorithm parameters. Two agents were tested, examining the impact of the observation space used by the agent and concluding that the best observation consists of the parameters of an auto-regressive with exogenous input model fitted to the measurements of the controlled variable. The best trained agent was deployed at an industrial comminution circuit where it was tested on two flow rate control loops. This agent improved the performance of one of these control loops but decreased the performance of the other control loop. While deep reinforcement learning does show promise in controller tuning, several challenges and directions for further study have been identified.",

        "abstract": "Each gene has its own evolutionary history which can substantially differ from the evolutionary histories of other genes. For example, some individual genes or operons can be affected by specific horizontal gene transfer or hybridization events. Thus, the evolutionary history of each gene should be represented by its own phylogenetic tree which may display different evolutionary patterns from the species tree, or Tree of Life, that represents the main patterns of vertical descent. Here, we present a new efficient method for inferring single or multiple consensus trees and supertrees for a given set of phylogenetic trees (i.e. additive trees or X-trees). The output of the traditional tree consensus methods is a unique consensus tree or supertree. Here, we show how Machine Learning (ML) models, based on some interesting properties of the Robinson and Foulds topological distance, can be used to partition a given set of trees into one (when the data are homogeneous) or multiple (when the data are heterogeneous) cluster(s) of trees. We adapt the popular Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and F1 scores to the tree clustering. A special attention is paid to the relevant, but very challenging, problem of inferring alternative supertrees that are built from phylogenies defined on different, but mutually overlapping, sets of species. The use of an approximate objective function in clustering makes the new method faster than the existing tree clustering techniques and thus suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets.",

In particular their spatial organisation appears to cause a strong impact of their radiative properties and dynamical evolution. The precise mechanisms driving different forms of convective organisation which arise both in nature and in simulations are however currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EUREC4A field campaign presents an unprecented oppertunity to study the ambient conditions (e.g. windshear, horizontal convergence, subsidence) while simultaneously measuring the cloud properties. Using an unsupervised neural network able to autonomously discover discover different patterns of convective organisation this work quantifies the ambient and cloud-properties present in differently organised regimes and in transitions between these regimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is trained on GOES-R imagery of the tropical Atlantic. Spatial maps of convective organisation and temporal evolution of these will be presented together with large-scale influences on their development, helping unpick the dynamics of convective clouds in this region.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "The advent of deep learning has completely reshaped our world. Now, our daily life is fulfilled with many well-known applications that adopt deep learning techniques, such as self-driving cars and face recognition. Furthermore, robotics developed more forms of technology which share the same principle with face recognition, such as hand pose recognition and fingerprint recognition. Image recognition technology requires a huge database and various learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, that requires lots of computational power, such as CPUs and GPUs. Thus, clients could not be satisfied with the computational resource of the local machine. The cloud resource platform emerged at a historic moment. Docker containers play a significant role of microservices-based applications in the next generation. However, it could not guarantee the quality of service. From clients&rsquo; perspective, they have to balance the budget and quality of experiences (e.g. response time). The budget leans on individual business owners and the required Quality of Experience (QoE) depends on usage scenarios of different applications, for instance, an autonomous vehicle requires real-time response, but, unlocking your smartphone can tolerate delays. Plenty of on-going projects developed user-oriented optimization resource allocation to improve the quality of the service. Considering the users&rsquo; specifications, including accelerating the training process and specifying the quality of experience, this thesis proposes two differentiate containers scheduling for deep learning applications: TRADL and DQoES .",

When a user transitions from a base station’s coverage area to another cell being serviced by another station, a handoff process takes place, where resources are released in the first base station, and allocated in the second for the purpose of servicing the user. Predicting the future location of a cell phone user allows the handoff process to be optimized. This optimization allows for a better utilization of the available resources, regarding bot the transmitted power and the frequency allocation, resulting in less amount of wasted power in unwanted directions and the possibility of reusing frequencies in a single base station. To achieve this goal, Deep Learning techniques are proposed, which have proven to be efficient tools for predicting and detecting patterns. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the state of the art in Deep Learning techniques for making spatio-temporal predictions, which could be used to optimize the handoff process in cellular systems. </b></p>",

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to estimate the CMPLDWG model’s posterior distributions.

Deep learning is a growing trend in the edge of technology and its applications are now seen in many aspects of our life such as object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Currently, almost all major sciences and technologies are benefiting from the advantages of deep learning such as high accuracy, speed and flexibility. Therefore, any efforts for improving performance of related techniques is valuable. Deep learning accelerators are considered as hardware architecture, which are designed and optimized for increasing the speed, efficiency and accuracy of computers that are running deep learning algorithms. In this paper, after reviewing some backgrounds about deep learning, a well-known accelerator architecture named MAERI is investigated. By using an open source tool called MAESTRO, the performance of a deep learning task is measured and compared on two different data flow strategies: NLR and NVDLA. Measured performance indicators of novel optimized architecture, NVDLA shows higher L1 and L2 computation reuse and lower total runtime (cycles) in comparison to the other one.",

        "abstract": "<p>An accurate and robust perception system is key to understanding the driving environment of autonomous driving and robots. Autonomous driving needs 3D information about objects, including the object’s location and pose, to understand the driving environment clearly. A camera sensor is widely used in autonomous driving because of its richness in color, texture, and low price. The major problem with the camera is the lack of 3D information, which is necessary to understand the 3D driving environment. Additionally, the object’s scale change and cclusion make 3D object detection more challenging. Many deep learning-based methods, such as depth estimation, have been developed to solve the lack of 3D information. This survey presents the image 3D object detection 3D bounding box encoding techniques, feature extraction techniques, and evaluation metrics of 3D object detection. The image-based methods are categorized based on the technique used to estimate an image’s depth information, and insights are added to each method. Then, state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular and stereo camera-based methods are summarized. We also compare the performance of the selected 3D object detection models and present challenges and future directions in 3D object detection.</p>",

Over the course of just a few years, deep learning revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics or medicine. Yet such a surge of tools and knowledge is still in its infancy in ecology despite the ever-growing size and the complexity of ecological datasets. Here we performed a literature review of deep learning implementations in ecology to identify its benefits in most ecological disciplines, even in applied ecology, up to decision makers and conservationists alike. We also provide guidelines on useful resources and recommendations for ecologists to start adding deep learning to their toolkit. At a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a necessity in ecology.",

If companies identify customers’ churn behavior, they can prevent customer loss, ensure customer loyalty, and in turn gain better financial returns. The telecommunication sector is a customer-oriented sector that requires customer retention to survive in the market and, in this sector customer loss is observed at a high level. In recent years, artificial intelligence-based customer churn analysis has been widely used to predict customers’ churn behavior. In this study, a customer churn analysis was conducted with publicly shared Telco telecom data. Predictive models were built with machine learning (LR, KNN, SVM, DT, RF, ANN), ensemble learning (XGBoost, Voting), and deep learning (LSTM) methods. Besides, a 3-layered LSTM model was proposed. Accuracy, F1, precision, and recall rates were used to evaluate the models. As a result, the novel 3-layered LSTM model achieved 91% accuracy, 87% precision, 84% recall, and 89% F1 values. The proposed model is competitive with the literature.",

The virus was first identified in mid-December 2019 in the Hubei province of Wuhan, China and by now has spread throughout the planet with more than 75.5 million confirmed cases and more than 1.67 million deaths. With limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in medical facilities, it is important to develop and implement an automatic detection system as an alternative diagnosis option for COVID-19 detection that can used on a commercial scale. Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can help in determining COVID-19 virus with Chest X-ray Images. Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional neural network for image analysis and classification. In this research, we have proposed a deep convolutional neural network trained on five open access datasets with binary output: Normal and Covid. The performance of the model is compared with four pre-trained convolutional neural network- based models (COVID-Net, ResNet18, ResNet and MobileNet-V2) and it has been seen that the proposed model provides better accuracy on the validation set as compared to the other four pre-trained models. This research work provides promising results which can be further improvise and implement on a commercial scale.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationComparing the human genome to the genomes of closely related mammalian species has been a powerful tool for discovering functional elements in the human genome. Millions of conserved elements have been discovered. However, understanding the functional roles of these elements still remain a challenge, especially in noncoding regions. In particular, it is still unclear why these elements are evolutionarily conserved and what kind of functional elements are encoded within these sequences.ResultsWe present a deep learning framework, called DeepCons, to uncover potential functional elements within conserved sequences. DeepCons is a convolutional neural net (CNN) that receives a short segment of DNA sequence as input and outputs the probability of the sequence of being evolutionary conserved. DeepCons utilizes hundreds of convolution kernels to detect features within DNA sequences, and automatically learns these kernels after training the CNN model using 887,577 conserved elements and a similar number of nonconserved elements in the human genome. On a balanced test dataset, DeepCons can achieve an accuracy of 75% in determining whether a sequence element is conserved or not, and the area under the ROC curve of 0.83, based on information from the human genome alone. We further investigate the properties of the learned kernels. Some kernels are directly related to well-known regulatory motifs corresponding to transcription factors. Many kernels show positional biases relative to transcriptional start sites or transcription end sites. But most of discovered kernels do not correspond to any known functional element, suggesting that they might represent unknown categories of functional elements. We also utilize DeepCons to annotate how changes at each individual nucleotide might impact the conservation properties of the surrounding sequences.AvailabilityThe source code of DeepCons and all the learned convolution kernels in motif format is publicly available online athttps://github.com/uci-cbcl/DeepCons.Contactxhx@ics.uci.edu",

Various studies have been proposed for classifying frog species, but most recordings are assumed to have only a single species. In this study, a method to classify multiple frog species in an audio clip is presented. To be specific, continuous frog recordings are first cropped into audio clips (10 seconds). Then, various time-frequency representations are generated for each 10-s recording. Next, instead of using traditional hand-crafted features, a deep learning algorithm is used to find the most important feature. Finally, a binary relevance based multi-label classification approach is proposed to classify simultaneously vocalizing frog species with our proposed features. Experimental results show that our proposed features extracted using deep learning can achieve better classification performance when compared to hand-crafted features for frog call classification.",

        "abstract": "Quantifying the error of predictions in earth system models is just as important as the quality of the predictions themselves. While machine learning methods become better by the day in emulating weather and climate forecasting systems, they are rarely used operationally. Two reasons for this are poor handling of extreme events and a lack of uncertainty quantification. The poor handling of extreme events can mainly be attributed to loss functions emphasizing accurate prediction of mean outcomes. Since extreme events are not frequent in climate and weather applications, capturing them accurately is not a natural consequence of minimizing such a loss. Uncertainty quantification for numerical weather prediction usually proceeds through creating an ensemble of predictions. The machine learning domain has adapted this to some extent, creating machine learning ensembles, with multiple architectures trained on the same data or the same architecture trained on altered datasets. Nevertheless, few approaches currently exist for tuning a deep learning ensemble.&#160;We introduce a new approach using a generative neural network, similar to those employed in adversarial learning, but we replace the discriminator with a new loss function. This gives us the control over the statistical properties the generator should learn and increases the stability of the training process immensely. By generating a prediction ensemble during training, we can tune ensemble properties such as variance or skewness in addition to the mean. Early results of this approach will be demonstrated using simple 1D experiments, showing the advantage over classically trained neural networks. Especially the task of predicting extremes and the added value of ensemble predictions will be highlighted. Additionally, predictions of a Lorenz-96 system are demonstrated to show the skill in forecasting chaotic systems.",

        "abstract": "To visualize high-dimensional geospatial data has achieved much importance in last decades. But to analyze it, the technologies used of machine learning are not so convincing and thus it is high time to switch to a sub-domain of machine learning called deep learning, which has gained popularity because of its accuracy in processing and analyzing high-dimensional data. The convergence of deep learning with geospatial data analytics shall prove to be a boon to those who actually has a need to predict specific outputs over geospatial data. In this paper, we have presented some geospatial data generated using the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) technology and proposed ways to implement deep learning over these data. GIS technology is a mapping technology which signifies high-dimensional geospatial data and our aim is to propose a model where GIS converges with highly efficient deep neural networks such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network). We have provided geospatial as well as statistical results in this paper to visualize practically the GIS technology. This paper further provides future scope of the proposed model which shall present the challenges that needs to be tackled in future and its applicability in many relevant domains.",

        "abstract": "Bury et al. (2021) present a powerful approach to anticipating tipping points based on deep learning that not only substantially outperforms traditional early warning indicators, but also classifies the type of bifurcation that may lie ahead. However, deep learning methods are notorious for sometimes exhibiting unintended behavior, and we show that this is also the case here. In particular, we find that the method did not extract features generic enough to classify stationary AR(1) processes that have not been detrended (or have been detrended using a Gaussian filter) as approaching no bifurcation. This suggests that using the same type of detrending as done during the training phase of the deep learning method is required for the method to work in practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article will show you a method for converting 2d images into 3d bounding boxes. The idea is to split the task into two steps. Firstly, we use neural network to output 3D object features displayed in 2D images. Then, we combine the boundary information of 2D objects in the images to generate geometric constraints on 3D objects, so as to get a complete 3D boundary box. In the first step, we defined an innovative loss function called combined_orientation_loss. This loss function took into account both the cosine distance and Euclidean distance, so that the length of the direction vector could also be reflected in the loss, which could enhance the sensitivity of the model to the prediction accuracy. In the second step, we return to the dimensions of 3D objects, which are relatively stable and therefore suitable for predicting a wide range of object types. Combining these two steps and the translation constraints of the object in the 2D image, we can accurately and stably restore its 3D border shape. We evaluated our approach on the KITTI target detection benchmark, including the official measure of 3D direction estimates and the accuracy of the resulting 3D bounding box. In the case of low calculation requirements achieved good results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis abstract discusses the application of time series analysis in predicting the stock market trends in Indian financial market. While short-term market forecasting can be challenging due to the complexity and emotional factors involved, long-term trends can be effectively studied using data science techniques such as statistical and analytical tools. In the past, predicting stock market changes has been difficult due to the intricate nature of financial markets and the influence of investor emotions. However, the use of data science methods like machine learning and deep learning has gained popularity, particularly because long-term stock market patterns often exhibit a more predictable trajectory. In a recent study it has found that time series analysis is a successful data science approach for uncovering patterns and trends in the stock market. By utilizing Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models is one of the promising methods for forecasting future market movements based on historical data. Additionally, exploring the connections between different stocks can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. Investigating these linkages may reveal essential details about market trends and potential investment prospects. It is expected that further research and development in this field will advance stock market analysis and forecasting, with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and supervised machine learning advancements in data science playing a significant role in this progress. Despite the difficulties that come with stock market forecasting, the development of data science approaches has allowed for major breakthroughs in this area. Scholars have made significant progress thanks in large part to the use of statistical and analytical techniques. The analysis and forecasting of the stock market are positioned to further expand as research and development activities continue, offering useful information to experts and investors alike. These developments in stock market analysis and prediction are anticipated to be greatly aided by the ongoing investigation of cutting-edge data science approaches like machine learning and deep learning. The potential benefits of this continuous development include providing stakeholders with crucial information that will enable them to make wise decisions in the financial markets.",

For training our models we used publicly available Kaggle data set. For testing we used portion of Kaggle data withheld from training and Messidor-2 reference standard. Neither withheld Kaggle images, nor Messidor-2 were used for training. For Messidor-2 we achieved sensitivity 99%, specificity 71%, and AUC 0.97. These results close to recent state-of-the-art models trained on much larger data sets and surpass average results of diabetic retinopathy screening when performed by trained optometrists.

This document introduces image registration using a simple numeric example. It provides a definition of image registration along with a space-oriented symbolic representation. This review covers various aspects of image transformations, including affine, deformable, invertible, and bidirectional transformations, as well as medical image registration algorithms such as Voxelmorph, Demons, SyN, Iterative Closest Point, and SynthMorph. It also explores atlas-based registration and multistage image registration techniques, including coarse-fine and pyramid approaches. Furthermore, this survey paper discusses medical image registration taxonomies, datasets, evaluation measures, such as correlation-based metrics, segmentation-based metrics, processing time, and model size. It also explores applications in image-guided surgery, motion tracking, and tumor diagnosis. Finally, the document addresses future research directions, including the further development of transformers.\n",

        "abstract": "Dilation of biliary tree can be an indicator of several diseases such as stones, tumors, benign strictures, and some cases cancer. This dilation can be due to many reasons such as gallstones, inflammation of the bile ducts, trauma, injury, severe liver damage. Automatic measurement of the biliary tree in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is helpful to assist hepatobiliary surgeons for minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, we proposed a model to segment biliary tree MRI images using a Fully Convolutional Neural (FCN) network. Based on the extracted area, seven features that include Entropy, standard deviation, RMS, kurtosis, skewness, Energy and maximum are computed. A database of images from King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) is used in this work, containing 800 MRI images; 400 cases with normal biliary tree; and 400 images with dilated biliary tree labeled by surgeons. Once the features are extracted, four classifiers (Multi-Layer perceptron neural network, support vector machine, k-NN and decision tree) are applied to predict the status of patient in terms of biliary tree (normal or dilated). All classifiers show high accuracy in terms of Area Under Curve except support vector machine. The contributions of this work include introducing a fully convolutional network for biliary tree segmentation, additionally scientifically correlate the extracted features with the status of biliary tree (normal or dilated) that have not been previously investigated in the literature from MRI images for biliary tree status determinations.",

        "abstract": "The heart of Industry 4.0 is established by a new technology called the internet of things (IoT). Through the internet, the IoT makes it possible for machines and gadgets to share signals. Using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to manage and regulate the communications between various equipment based on intelligent decisions is made possible by the internet of things (IoT) technology. Data collection devices can be fundamentally altered to “lock in” to the best sensing data with regard to a user-defined cost function or design constraint by utilizing inverse design and machine learning techniques. By allowing low-cost and small sensor implementations developed through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes, a new generation of intelligence sensing systems reduces the data load while significantly enhancing sensing capabilities. Machine learning-enabled computational sensors can encourage the development of widely distributed applications that leverage the internet of things to build robust sensing networks that have an influence across a variety of industries.",

        "abstract": "Deep artificial neural network applications to robotic systems have seen a surge of study due to advancements in deep learning over the past 10 years. The ability of robots to explain the descriptions of their decisions and beliefs leads to a collaboration with the human race. The intensity of the challenges increases as robotics moves from lab to the real-world scenario. Existing robotic control algorithms find it extremely difficult to master the wide variety seen in real-world contexts. The robots have now been developed and advanced to such an extent that they can be useful in our day-to-day lives. All this has been possible because of improvisation of the algorithmic techniques and enhanced computation powers. The majority of traditional machine learning techniques call for parameterized models and functions that must be manually created, making them unsuitable for many robotic jobs. The pattern recognition paradigm may be switched from the combined learning of statistical representations, labelled classifiers, to the joint learning of manmade features and analytical classifiers.",

In the last few years, an explosive growth has been seen in the dimension and structure of data. There are several difficulties faced by conventional ML algorithms while dealing with such highly voluminous and unstructured big data. The modern ML tools are designed and used to deal with all sorts of complexities of data. Deep learning (DL) is one of the modern ML tools which are commonly used to find the hidden structure and cohesion among these large data sets by giving proper training in parallel platforms with intelligent optimization techniques to further analyze and interpret the data for future prediction and classification. This article focuses on the use of DL tools and software which are used in past couple of years in various areas and especially in the area of healthcare applications. ",

The current study assessed the performance of several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for detecting and mapping floods using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Three distinct approaches were used with machine learning and deep learning models: pixel classification, object-based image analysis and object instance segmentation. The ML models are Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine applied for pixel classification and object-based image analysis. The DL models are U-NET, DeepLabV3 and Mask RCNN used for pixel classification and object instance segmentation. The models were implemented using SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform), ESRI ArcGIS Pro, Esri ArcGIS API for Python and Python programming language. To test the model's scalability, five different cases studies were selected. These areas are located in Romania (Prut River sector, Timi&amp;#537; River sector and R&amp;#226;ul Negru sector), the United States of America (Missouri River sector) and Australia (Broughton Creek sector). Five Sentinel-1 images were used for each flood, having four collected previous to the flood event and one collected after the flood event. Each Sentinel-1 image was calibrated and ortho-corrected, and filtered using SNAP. The intensity images were stacked and scaled in the range of the intensity thresholds associated with water and non-water so that all the case studies have the same margins for intensity. Further, samples were collected in ArcGIS Pro from the Prut River region using the stack of images created from the previous step. Besides water, other classes, such as forest, agricultural fields and bare soil, were collected and used in the training process. The training for the ML models took place directly on the standardized radar images within ArcGIS Pro. The training of the DL models was done through the use of Jupyter Notebooks and ArcGIS API for Python. The models were trained on samples collected from the Prut River area and then tested on all selected regions to assess their ability to perform in different study areas. The highest accuracy, calculated as Intersect over Union, was obtained by the U-Net model (IoU score of 0.74). Comparable accuracies were obtained by the RF and SVM models implemented with OBIA, with an IoU score of 0.72. Mask R-CNN and DeepLabV3 got IoU scores of 0.70, and the lowest accuracies for floods mapping were obtained by the RF and SVM models implemented as pixel classification (both having IoU scores of 0.53).&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Bankruptcy prediction has long been an interesting topic to be discussed and developed by many researchers. Initially, the development of bankruptcy prediction models was carried out through statistical methods by examining corporate's financial ratios. Along with the development of technology, the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for developing bankruptcy prediction models has begun to be widely used, for example, SVM, ANN, hybrid genetic algorithm, fuzzy-SVM, convolutional neural network, textual disclosure, and so on. Although machine learning and deep learning models have various advantages over statistical methods, they still have many drawbacks. In this paper, we will review machine learning and deep learning models used in bankruptcy prediction using the Systematic Literature Review method. Based on our research, bankruptcy prediction models developed using machine learning or deep learning techniques can outperform the performance of models using classical statistical methods.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces advanced methodology for classifying malware by leveraging hybrid deep learning algorithms. The research presents a pioneering framework that seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to deliver a robust malware classification approach. The primary objective is to effectively differentiate between normal behavioral patterns and malicious network data. The efficacy of this innovative approach is evaluated by comparing it with conventional machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM). Through this comparative analysis, the investigation aims to uncover the unique strengths and potential limitations of the proposed method, with the intention of establishing it as a superior alternative to current malware classification methods. By harnessing the individual capabilities of CNN and LSTM models, the proposed framework achieves a higher level of accuracy in identifying and categorizing malware compared to existing approaches. While CNN models excel in feature extraction from raw data, LSTM models exhibit proficiency in understanding sequential patterns. By synergizing these models, the resulting framework demonstrates significantly improved performance in classifying malware. The empirical assessment strongly suggests that the newly proposed framework is poised to outperform established techniques. These research findings hold great promise in advancing the development of more efficient systems for detecting and preventing malware.",

(2021) present a powerful approach to anticipating tipping points based on deep learning that not only substantially outperforms traditional early warning indicators, but also classifies the type of bifurcation that may lie ahead. However, deep learning methods are notorious for sometimes exhibiting unintended behavior, and we show that this is also the case here. In particular, we find that the method did not extract features generic enough to classify stationary AR(1) processes that have not been detrended (or have been detrended using a Gaussian filter) as approaching no bifurcation. This suggests that using the same type of detrending as done during the training phase of the deep learning method is required for the method to work in practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article will show you a method for converting 2d images into 3d bounding boxes. The idea is to split the task into two steps. Firstly, we use neural network to output 3D object features displayed in 2D images. Then, we combine the boundary information of 2D objects in the images to generate geometric constraints on 3D objects, so as to get a complete 3D boundary box. In the first step, we defined an innovative loss function called combined_orientation_loss. This loss function took into account both the cosine distance and Euclidean distance, so that the length of the direction vector could also be reflected in the loss, which could enhance the sensitivity of the model to the prediction accuracy. In the second step, we return to the dimensions of 3D objects, which are relatively stable and therefore suitable for predicting a wide range of object types. Combining these two steps and the translation constraints of the object in the 2D image, we can accurately and stably restore its 3D border shape. We evaluated our approach on the KITTI target detection benchmark, including the official measure of 3D direction estimates and the accuracy of the resulting 3D bounding box. In the case of low calculation requirements achieved good results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis abstract discusses the application of time series analysis in predicting the stock market trends in Indian financial market. While short-term market forecasting can be challenging due to the complexity and emotional factors involved, long-term trends can be effectively studied using data science techniques such as statistical and analytical tools. In the past, predicting stock market changes has been difficult due to the intricate nature of financial markets and the influence of investor emotions. However, the use of data science methods like machine learning and deep learning has gained popularity, particularly because long-term stock market patterns often exhibit a more predictable trajectory. In a recent study it has found that time series analysis is a successful data science approach for uncovering patterns and trends in the stock market. By utilizing Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models is one of the promising methods for forecasting future market movements based on historical data. Additionally, exploring the connections between different stocks can provide valuable insights into market trends and potential investment opportunities. Investigating these linkages may reveal essential details about market trends and potential investment prospects. It is expected that further research and development in this field will advance stock market analysis and forecasting, with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and supervised machine learning advancements in data science playing a significant role in this progress. Despite the difficulties that come with stock market forecasting, the development of data science approaches has allowed for major breakthroughs in this area. Scholars have made significant progress thanks in large part to the use of statistical and analytical techniques. The analysis and forecasting of the stock market are positioned to further expand as research and development activities continue, offering useful information to experts and investors alike. These developments in stock market analysis and prediction are anticipated to be greatly aided by the ongoing investigation of cutting-edge data science approaches like machine learning and deep learning. The potential benefits of this continuous development include providing stakeholders with crucial information that will enable them to make wise decisions in the financial markets.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative prediction of reaction properties, such as activation energy, have been limited due to a lack of available training data. Such predictions would be useful for computer-assisted reaction mechanism generation and organic synthesis planning. We develop a template-free deep learning model to predict activation energy given reactant and product graphs and train the model on a new, diverse data set of gas-phase quantum chemistry reactions. We demonstrate that our model achieves accurate predictions and agrees with an intuitive understanding of chemical reactivity. With the continued generation of quantitative chemical reaction data and development of methods that leverage such data, we expect many more methods for reactivity prediction to become available in the near future.",

We make use of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven revolutionary in multiple fields of computer vision including medical imaging, and we bring their power to the diagnosis of eye fundus images. For training our models we used publicly available Kaggle data set. For testing we used portion of Kaggle data withheld from training and Messidor-2 reference standard. Neither withheld Kaggle images, nor Messidor-2 were used for training. For Messidor-2 we achieved sensitivity 99%, specificity 71%, and AUC 0.97. These results close to recent state-of-the-art models trained on much larger data sets and surpass average results of diabetic retinopathy screening when performed by trained optometrists. With continuous development of our Deep Learning models we expect to further increase the accuracy of the method and expand it to cataract and glaucoma diagnostics.",

This document introduces image registration using a simple numeric example. It provides a definition of image registration along with a space-oriented symbolic representation. This review covers various aspects of image transformations, including affine, deformable, invertible, and bidirectional transformations, as well as medical image registration algorithms such as Voxelmorph, Demons, SyN, Iterative Closest Point, and SynthMorph. It also explores atlas-based registration and multistage image registration techniques, including coarse-fine and pyramid approaches. Furthermore, this survey paper discusses medical image registration taxonomies, datasets, evaluation measures, such as correlation-based metrics, segmentation-based metrics, processing time, and model size. It also explores applications in image-guided surgery, motion tracking, and tumor diagnosis. Finally, the document addresses future research directions, including the further development of transformers.\n",

        "abstract": "Dilation of biliary tree can be an indicator of several diseases such as stones, tumors, benign strictures, and some cases cancer. This dilation can be due to many reasons such as gallstones, inflammation of the bile ducts, trauma, injury, severe liver damage. Automatic measurement of the biliary tree in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is helpful to assist hepatobiliary surgeons for minimally invasive surgery. In this paper, we proposed a model to segment biliary tree MRI images using a Fully Convolutional Neural (FCN) network. Based on the extracted area, seven features that include Entropy, standard deviation, RMS, kurtosis, skewness, Energy and maximum are computed. A database of images from King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) is used in this work, containing 800 MRI images; 400 cases with normal biliary tree; and 400 images with dilated biliary tree labeled by surgeons. Once the features are extracted, four classifiers (Multi-Layer perceptron neural network, support vector machine, k-NN and decision tree) are applied to predict the status of patient in terms of biliary tree (normal or dilated). All classifiers show high accuracy in terms of Area Under Curve except support vector machine. The contributions of this work include introducing a fully convolutional network for biliary tree segmentation, additionally scientifically correlate the extracted features with the status of biliary tree (normal or dilated) that have not been previously investigated in the literature from MRI images for biliary tree status determinations.",

Through the internet, the IoT makes it possible for machines and gadgets to share signals. Using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to manage and regulate the communications between various equipment based on intelligent decisions is made possible by the internet of things (IoT) technology. Data collection devices can be fundamentally altered to “lock in” to the best sensing data with regard to a user-defined cost function or design constraint by utilizing inverse design and machine learning techniques. By allowing low-cost and small sensor implementations developed through iterative analysis of data-driven sensing outcomes, a new generation of intelligence sensing systems reduces the data load while significantly enhancing sensing capabilities. Machine learning-enabled computational sensors can encourage the development of widely distributed applications that leverage the internet of things to build robust sensing networks that have an influence across a variety of industries.",

        "abstract": "Deep artificial neural network applications to robotic systems have seen a surge of study due to advancements in deep learning over the past 10 years. The ability of robots to explain the descriptions of their decisions and beliefs leads to a collaboration with the human race. The intensity of the challenges increases as robotics moves from lab to the real-world scenario. Existing robotic control algorithms find it extremely difficult to master the wide variety seen in real-world contexts. The robots have now been developed and advanced to such an extent that they can be useful in our day-to-day lives. All this has been possible because of improvisation of the algorithmic techniques and enhanced computation powers. The majority of traditional machine learning techniques call for parameterized models and functions that must be manually created, making them unsuitable for many robotic jobs. The pattern recognition paradigm may be switched from the combined learning of statistical representations, labelled classifiers, to the joint learning of manmade features and analytical classifiers.",

In the last few years, an explosive growth has been seen in the dimension and structure of data. There are several difficulties faced by conventional ML algorithms while dealing with such highly voluminous and unstructured big data. The modern ML tools are designed and used to deal with all sorts of complexities of data. Deep learning (DL) is one of the modern ML tools which are commonly used to find the hidden structure and cohesion among these large data sets by giving proper training in parallel platforms with intelligent optimization techniques to further analyze and interpret the data for future prediction and classification. This article focuses on the use of DL tools and software which are used in past couple of years in various areas and especially in the area of healthcare applications. ",

The current study assessed the performance of several machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for detecting and mapping floods using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. Three distinct approaches were used with machine learning and deep learning models: pixel classification, object-based image analysis and object instance segmentation. The ML models are Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine applied for pixel classification and object-based image analysis. The DL models are U-NET, DeepLabV3 and Mask RCNN used for pixel classification and object instance segmentation. The models were implemented using SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform), ESRI ArcGIS Pro, Esri ArcGIS API for Python and Python programming language. To test the model's scalability, five different cases studies were selected. These areas are located in Romania (Prut River sector, Timi&amp;#537; River sector and R&amp;#226;ul Negru sector), the United States of America (Missouri River sector) and Australia (Broughton Creek sector). Five Sentinel-1 images were used for each flood, having four collected previous to the flood event and one collected after the flood event. Each Sentinel-1 image was calibrated and ortho-corrected, and filtered using SNAP. The intensity images were stacked and scaled in the range of the intensity thresholds associated with water and non-water so that all the case studies have the same margins for intensity. Further, samples were collected in ArcGIS Pro from the Prut River region using the stack of images created from the previous step. Besides water, other classes, such as forest, agricultural fields and bare soil, were collected and used in the training process. The training for the ML models took place directly on the standardized radar images within ArcGIS Pro. The training of the DL models was done through the use of Jupyter Notebooks and ArcGIS API for Python. The models were trained on samples collected from the Prut River area and then tested on all selected regions to assess their ability to perform in different study areas. The highest accuracy, calculated as Intersect over Union, was obtained by the U-Net model (IoU score of 0.74). Comparable accuracies were obtained by the RF and SVM models implemented with OBIA, with an IoU score of 0.72. Mask R-CNN and DeepLabV3 got IoU scores of 0.70, and the lowest accuracies for floods mapping were obtained by the RF and SVM models implemented as pixel classification (both having IoU scores of 0.53).&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Bankruptcy prediction has long been an interesting topic to be discussed and developed by many researchers. Initially, the development of bankruptcy prediction models was carried out through statistical methods by examining corporate's financial ratios. Along with the development of technology, the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for developing bankruptcy prediction models has begun to be widely used, for example, SVM, ANN, hybrid genetic algorithm, fuzzy-SVM, convolutional neural network, textual disclosure, and so on. Although machine learning and deep learning models have various advantages over statistical methods, they still have many drawbacks. In this paper, we will review machine learning and deep learning models used in bankruptcy prediction using the Systematic Literature Review method. Based on our research, bankruptcy prediction models developed using machine learning or deep learning techniques can outperform the performance of models using classical statistical methods.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces advanced methodology for classifying malware by leveraging hybrid deep learning algorithms. The research presents a pioneering framework that seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to deliver a robust malware classification approach. The primary objective is to effectively differentiate between normal behavioral patterns and malicious network data. The efficacy of this innovative approach is evaluated by comparing it with conventional machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM). Through this comparative analysis, the investigation aims to uncover the unique strengths and potential limitations of the proposed method, with the intention of establishing it as a superior alternative to current malware classification methods. By harnessing the individual capabilities of CNN and LSTM models, the proposed framework achieves a higher level of accuracy in identifying and categorizing malware compared to existing approaches. While CNN models excel in feature extraction from raw data, LSTM models exhibit proficiency in understanding sequential patterns. By synergizing these models, the resulting framework demonstrates significantly improved performance in classifying malware. The empirical assessment strongly suggests that the newly proposed framework is poised to outperform established techniques. These research findings hold great promise in advancing the development of more efficient systems for detecting and preventing malware.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Deep fake is a rapidly growing concern in society, and it has become a significant challenge to detect such manipulated media. Deep fake detection involves identifying whether a media file is authentic or generated using deep learning algorithms. In this project, we propose a deep learning-based approach for detecting deep fakes in videos. We use the Deep fake Detection Challenge dataset, which consists of real and Deep fake videos, to train and evaluate our deep learning model. We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for our implementation, which has shown great potential in previous studies. We pre-process the dataset using several techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance the quality of the input data. Our proposed model achieves high detection accuracy of 97.5% on the Deep fake Detection Challenge dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach for deep fake detection. Our approach has the potential to be used in real-world scenarios to detect deep fakes, helping to mitigate the risks posed by deep fakes to individuals and society. The proposed methodology can also be extended to detect in other types of media, such as images and audio, providing a comprehensive solution for deep fake detection.",

Recent advancements in medical imaging technology, coupled with the successful application of deep learning to visual tasks, have driven numerous studies investigating early disease diagnosis through medical imaging. In particular, deep learning has been employed for COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scan images. This paper proposes an ensemble COVID detection model that integrates four models including GoogleNet, EfficientNet, Hybrid EfficientNet and DOLG, and DenseNet121. And an augmentation dataset for training/testing is utilized in this work. To comparing performance, we train four models separately with our ensemble model and evaluate their results. The results demonstrate that our ensemble model outperforms all individual models, obtaining a detection accuracy of 94 percents. Hence, our proposed ensemble model shows the potential of the ensemble method in improving the accuracy of COVID diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;Accurate streamflow forecasts are important for many operational purposes, like hydropower operation or flood risk management. It is obvious that for data-driven models best prediction performance would be obtained if recent streamflow observations were used as an additional model input. Therefore, there exists a certain imperative which demands to use forecasting models that use discharge signals whenever available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting models are, however, not well suited when continuous measurement of discharge can not be guaranteed or for applications in ungauged settings. Regarding the former, missing data can have long lasting repercussions on data-driven models if large data-windows are used for the input. Regarding the latter, data-driven forecast models are not applicable at all. Additionally, we would like to point out that data-driven simulation models need to represent the underlying hydrological processes more closely since the setup explicitly reflects the rainfall-runoff relationship. To conclude, in many contexts, it is more appropriate to use process or simulation models, which do not use discharge as input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the above mentioned difficulties of forecasting models it would nevertheless be beneficial to integrate, whenever available, past runoff information in simulation models in order to improve their accuracy. To this end, multiple potential approaches and strategies are available. In the context of conceptual or physically based rainfall-runoff models, recent runoff information is usually exploited by data assimilation/updating approaches (e.g. input-, state-, parameter- or output-updating). In this contribution we concentrate on input-updating approaches, since it allows to adjust the system for a forecasting period even if no explicit process can be attached to the system states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose and examine different input-updating techniques for DL-based runoff models that can be used as baselines for future studies on data-assimilation tasks and which can be used with arbitrary differentiable model. To test the proposed approaches, we perform a series of experiments on a large set of basins throughout the continental United States. The results show that even simple updating techniques can strongly improve the forecasting accuracy.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

        "abstract": " Euler-Lagrange (EL) and Euler-Euler (EE) techniques have been widely employed for solving particle, droplet, and bubble-laden flows. Since flow around the individual particles is not resolved, the accuracy of the technique depends on the fidelity of the point-particle force laws used. The main focus of this talk is the use of emerging machine learning techniques along with physical insight into the averaging processes involved in the EL and EE techniques can yield closures that recover fully-resolved-like accuracy at orders of magnitude lower cost.The standard EL approach has been limited to (i) particles of size much smaller than the grid-scale and (ii) dilute flows where inter-particle interaction is weak. We will discuss recent developments that begin to ease these limitations. As the grid size approaches the particle size, we face the unpleasant prospect of force law becoming less accurate due to the self-induced flow generated, which corrupts the estimation of undisturbed flow velocity. We will discuss theoretical approaches to properly correcting for the self-induced flow. We will also present the data-driven pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model which rigorously extends the point-particle technique to higher volume fractions. This model systematically accounts for the precise location of all the neighboring particles. We will also present results from the application of deep learning where the algorithm is trained to predict multiphase flow.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe analysis of fundus images for the early screening of eye diseases is of great clinical importance. Traditional methods for such analysis are time-consuming and expensive as they require a trained clinician. Therefore, the need for a comprehensive and automated clinical decision support system to diagnose and grade retinal diseases has long been recognized. In the past decade, with the substantial developments in computer vision and deep learning, machine learning methods have become highly effective in this field to address this need. However, most of these algorithms face challenges like computational feasibility, reliability, and interpretability.In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce a very powerful feature extraction method for fundus images by employing the latest topological data analysis methods. Through our experiments, we observe that our topological feature vectors are highly effective in distinguishing normal and abnormal classes for the most common retinal diseases, i.e., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, these topological features are interpretable, computationally feasible, and can be seamlessly integrated into any forthcoming ML model in the domain. Secondly, we move forward in this direction, constructing a topological deep learning model by integrating our topological features with several deep learning models. Empirical analysis shows a notable enhancement in performance aided by the use of topological features. Remarkably, our model surpasses all existing models, demonstrating superior performance across several benchmark datasets pertaining to two of these three retinal diseases.",

Thus, the examination of new proposals for fruit classification is worthwhile. In the present time, automatic fruit classification is though a demanding task.Deep learning is a powerful state of the art approach for image classification [1] This task incorporates deep learning models: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for classification of fruits based on chosen optimal and derived features. As preliminary arises, it has been recognized that the recommended procedure has effective accuracy and quantitative analysis results.

        "abstract": "<p>Apple is one of the most popular plants in the Indian-origin Kashmir valley, where it is grown on about half of the horticultural land. Every year, the apples from Kashmir are exported to other areas of the globe, creating a substantial amount of revenue. However, apple trees are prone to diseases like apple scab, alternaria leaf blotch, and apple rot, which devastate apple yields and cause major losses for apple growers. Disease in apple plants mostly originates in the leaves and causes significant losses to apple farmers. Consequently, the prompt detection or prediction of such diseases is essential in a country like India, where half of the population does farming. The early detection of apple plant diseases may enable apple producers to take the necessary precautions immediately to save the fruits from illness. The conventional methods of apple plant disease prediction are time-consuming and laborious, involving lab assistance to diagnose the apple leaves for possible diseases. With the advent of machine learning and deep learning, it is now possible to quickly determine if a plant is infected or not with reliable accuracy. In this article, we introduce D-KAP, a deep learning-based Kashmiri apple plant disease prediction framework capable of detecting the above-described diseases. For feature extraction and prediction, our model employs the advanced deep learning capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In conclusion, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in identifying apple plant diseases with an accuracy of 92 percent over testing samples. In addition, we also introduce a novel Kashmiri apple plant leaf dataset containing samples of three distinct diseases along with healthy leaves.</p>",

Here we report preliminary findings in our development of DECIMER (Deep lEarning for Chemical ImagE Recognition), a deep learning method based on existing show-and-tell deep neural networks which makes very few assumptions about the structure of the underlying problem. The training state reported here does not yet rival the performance of existing traditional approaches, but we present evidence that our method will reach a comparable detection power with sufficient training time. Training success of DECIMER depends on the input data representation: DeepSMILES are clearly superior over SMILES and we have preliminary indication that the recently reported SELFIES outperform DeepSMILES. An extrapolation of our results towards larger training data sizes suggest that we might be able to achieve >90% accuracy with about 60 to 100 million training  structures, so that training can be completed within several months on a single GPU.

        "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR)— a leading cause of blindness— is a diabetes complication whichcauses damage to retinal blood vessels. DR can be treated non-invasively if diagnosed early enough.However, early diagnosis requires a medical examination, which may not be possible in some demographicalregions. Much previous work has largely focused on determining the presence of DR and not the severity.Thus, the goal of this study was to develop a single neural network that could 1) detect presence or absence of DR2) perform early detection of DR 3) perform multi-class classification on DR severity.",

In this short survey we provide an overview of DRL applied to trading on financial markets, including a short meta-analysis using Google Scholar, with an emphasis on using hierarchy for dividing the problem space as well as using model-based RL to learn a world model of the trading environment which can be used for prediction. In addition, multiple risk measures are defined and discussed, which not only provide a way of quantifying the performance of various algorithms, but they can also act as (dense) reward-shaping mechanisms for the agent. We discuss in detail the various state representations used for financial markets, which we consider critical for the success and efficiency of such DRL agents. The market in focus for this survey is the cryptocurrency market.",

This study aimed to evaluate the classification accuracy of convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models using cropped panoramic radiographs based on these classifications. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of single-task and multi-task learning after labeling 1,330 images of mandibular third molars from digital radiographs taken at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at a general hospital (2014-2021). The mandibular third molar classifications were analyzed using a VGG 16 model of a CNN. We statistically evaluated performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the curve [AUC]) for each prediction. We found that single-task learning was superior to multi-task learning (all p<0.05) for all metrics, with large effect sizes and low p-values. Recall and F1 scores for position classification showed medium effect sizes in single and multi-task learning. To our knowledge, this deep learning study is the first to examine single-task and multi-task learning for the classification of mandibular third molars. Our results demonstrated the efficacy of implementing Pell and Gregory, and Winter’s classifications for specific respective tasks.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide, and early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious. The relevance and potential of automatic classification algorithms using Hematoxylin-Eosin stained histopathological images have already been demonstrated, but the reported results are still sub-optimal for clinical use. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been gaining popularity for analyzing histopathological images. Based on the predominant cancer type, the goal is to classify images into four categories of normal, benign, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This chapter utilizes several deep neural network architectures and gradient boosted trees classifier to classify the histology images among four classes. Hence, this approach has outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy and implementation complexity.",

        "abstract": "Background: Numerous mathematical models have been developed to forecast COVID-19 cases and helped to plan effectively by strengthening public health infrastructure and services. Many researchers incorporated the long-short term memory model (LSTM) but they have not clearly explained the workflow and steps involved in this model. Moreover, being relatively new, these models are not yet popular among biomedical researchers due to a lack of expertise. This paper presents such models as a tutorial for easy understanding and appropriate use. This includes Python codes and real-time data with instructions for implementation to forecast pandemics like COVID-19. Data and Methods: Daily cases in India from 1-Dec-2021 to 10-Feb-2022 and, in the UK from 1-May-2021 to 10-Feb-2022 were used to train the models. We used Convolutional-LSTM (CNN-LSTM) model and simple LSTM models to forecast COVID-19 cases. Models were validated using data from 11 to 25-Feb-2022. Results: CNN-LSTM and simple LSTM were fitted very well with R2 0.95 and 0.97 for India. The models were validated with RMSE and it was 9972.81 and 19285.57 for CNN-LSTM and the simple LSTM model. The R2 value of CNN-LSTM and simple LSTM models for UK data were 0.77 and 0.84 respectively. RMSE was 12111.95 for CNN-LSTM and 8935.75 for simple LSTM in the validation. Conclusion: Simple LSTM works better while training whereas the performance of CNN-LSTM was found to be better in validation. Therefore, it is suggested that train various models instead of sticking to one and revise them regularly as the behavior of an epidemic generally changes over time.",

In both R2F and PdM we have the data related to the maintenance cycle. In case of Preventive Maintenance (PvM) complete information about maintenance cycle is not available. Among these three maintenance policies, predictive Maintenance (PdM) is becoming a very important strategy as it can help us to minimize the repair time and the associated cost with it. In this paper we have proposed PdM, which allows the dynamic decision rules for the maintenance management. PdM is achieved by training the machine learning model with the datasets. It also helps in planning of maintenance schedules. We specially focused on two models that are Binary Classification and Recurrent Neural Network. In Binary Classification we classify whether our data belongs to the failure class or the non failure class. In Binary Classification the number of cycles is entered and classification model predicts whether it belongs to the failure/non failure class.",

Forecasting yields provides producers, consumers, traders and policy makers with important preliminary information and time to take necessary action. Corn is an important product in terms of international trade and is widely used in human and animal nutrition throughout the world. Adana produces the highest amount of corn sown both as main and secondary product in Turkiye. Therefore, in this study, corn yield was tried to be estimated by using various meteorological parameters and plant fertilizer usage amounts. For this purpose, statistical (Auto-ARIMA), machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (CNN, LSTM) methods were used. The study findings showed that all models used predicted maize yield highly accurately. However, the highest accuracy LSTM model estimated the yield of first corn crop.",

        "abstract": "<p>As social networks continue to gain widespread popularity, an urgent requirement arises to automatically identify and detect offensive language and hate speech. While there is a wealth of research and datasets available for English in this domain, there is currently a scarcity of research and datasets focused on identifying hate speech and offensive language in Persian text. This article introduces a 3-class dataset named Pars-HaO, consisting of 8013 tweets, to fill the gap in existing research. We collected the dataset by combining comments from pages that are more exposed to hate speech and using a keyword-based approach. Three annotators then labeled the tweets. In this study, we employed a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and four widely recognized machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) as a baseline. Then, we compared the base models with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and CNN models, each trained using the output of the last hidden state of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on the Pars HaO dataset demonstrated that the BERT with BiLSTM technique yielded the best outcome, achieving a macro F1-score of 70%. <br>\n  </p>",

Ensemble learning has been widely used for image classification, but its methods have not been fully optimized. This study was performed to investigate the usefulness of ensemble learning and compare a number of ensemble learning techniques using multiple convolutional neural network (CNN)-trained models for image classification of liver masses in US images. The US imaging data set was classified into four categories: benign liver tumor (BLT, 6320 images), liver cyst (LCY, 2320 images), metastatic liver cancer (MLC, 9720 images), and primary liver cancer (PLC, 7840 images). In this study, 250 test images were randomly selected for each class, for a total of 1000 images, and the remaining images were used for training. Sixteen different CNNs were used for to train and test the US images. All four types of ensemble learning&mdash;soft voting (SV), stacking (ST), weighted average voting (WAV), and weighted hard voting (WHV)&mdash;showed greater accuracy than the single CNN. All four types also showed significantly better deep learning performance than ResNeXt101 alone. For image classification of liver masses using US images, ensemble learning improved the performance of deep learning over a single CNN.",

Active learning is poised to be a solution for drug discovery in low-data regimes. In active learning, a model is updated iteratively by taking multiple smaller screening steps, instead of suggesting many molecules at once with a single model for traditional ‘one-shot’ screening. This iterative approach aims to improve models during the screening process and can adjust course along the way. Despite pioneering applications, it is currently unclear how active learning holds up to traditional approaches and what the best strategies are for prospective drug discovery applications. In this study, we combine six active learning strategies with two distinct deep learning methods and analyse their performance on three large-scale libraries. For each strategy, we investigate its capacity to discover bioactive hits and explore the chemical space. We found that active learning can achieve up to a six-fold improvement in hit retrieval compared to traditional methods in a low-data scenario. The strategy to acquire new molecules at each cycle resulted to be the primary driver of performance, and it determined the ‘molecular journey’ throughout screening cycles. Finally, we show that active learning can quickly compensate for a lack of molecular diversity in the starting set. These results advocate for the adoption of active deep learning to accelerate drug discovery in low-data regimes.",

We highlight that active learning can achieve up to a six-fold improvement in hit discovery compared to traditional methods. How molecules are chosen for the next iteration proved to be the primary driver of performance – it is more important than the chosen network architecture in determining the ‘molecular journey’ in the chemical space. Remarkably, active learning showed to quickly compensate for a lack of molecular diversity in the starting set, allowing to efficiently chart unexplored structural motifs. These results set the basis for the adoption of active deep learning to accelerate drug discovery in low-data regimes.",

        "abstract": "The distribution of energy dose from Lu177 radiotherapy can be estimated by convolving an image of a time-integrated activity distribution with a dose voxel kernel (DVK) consisting of different types of tissues. This fast and inacurate approximation is inappropriate for personalized dosimetry as it neglects tissue heterogenity. The latter can be calculated using different imaging techniques such as CT and SPECT combined with a time consuming monte-carlo simulation. The aim of this study is, for the first time, an estimation of DVKs from CT-derived density kernels (DK) via deep learning in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed CNN achieved, on the test set, a mean intersection over union (IOU) of =0.86 after 308 epochs and a corresponding mean squared error (MSE) =1.24⋅10−4. This generalization ability shows that the trained CNN can indeed learn the difficult transfer function from DK to DVK. Future work will evaluate DVKs estimated by CNNs with full monte-carlo simulations of a whole body CT to predict patient specific voxel dose maps.",

As a result, automatic emotion recognition aims to provide a machine with the human ability to interpret and comprehend a person's emotional state in order to predict his intents based on his facial expression. In this research, a new method for improving the accuracy of emotion recognition from facial expression is proposed, which is based solely on input attributes deduced from fiducial points. First, 1200 dynamic features representing the percentage of euclidean distances between facial fiducial points in the first frame and facial fiducial points in the last frame are extracted from image sequences. Second, just the most relevant features are chosen using active learning method. Finally, to categorise facial expression input into emotion, the selected features are provided to a ResNet classifier.",

This research applies the natural language processing deep learning model BERT to analyze positive and negative sentiments from hotel visitor reviews in Indonesia. The BERT model undergoes a pre-trained and fine-tuned process to produce accurate sentiment analysis. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned SmallBERT model performs well, trained on a dataset of 515k hotel reviews for five epochs. The SmallBERT model achieves an accuracy of 91.40%, precision of 90.51%, recall of 90.51%, and an F1 score of 90.51% when evaluated with manually labelled datasets. Visualizations of the predominantly positive sentiment comparisons are conducted using Tableau.",

Deep Learning is a group of neural network algorithms and learns from various levels of representation and abstraction to aid in the data interpretation. Since the datasets get bigger, computers become more powerful, and the training of the datasets (images or numeric) gets much easier and the results achieved using deep learning are better. In contrast to machine-learning algorithms that rely on large amounts of labelled data, human cognition can find structure in unlabeled data, a technique known as unsupervised learning. It was noted that using deep learning algorithms on the dataset will reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in future.

Every year, numerous road accidents are caused by drivers due to their drowsiness. It can be minimized by alerting the driver, and it has been done by identifying and recognizing the initial stages of drowsiness. Several models have been proposed to detect drivers' drowsiness and alert them before a road accident occurs. However, the most prominent one is VGG16 with a transfer learning mechanism that is utilized to view the status of the respective regions of interest. By utilizing these models, the drivers are monitored, and alarms are generated to alert the drivers as well as the passengers. This experimental analysis was carried out on the Kaggle Yawn-Eye-Dataset (KYED), and the results showed the low computational intricacy and high precision of the eye closure estimation and the ability of the proposed system for drowsiness detection.",

The objective is to develop an accurate model that can assist farmers in making informed decisions about nutrient management and improving crop productivity. The proposed approach employs a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for analyzing soil samples and forecasting nutrient content. Subsequently, the trained model is harnessed to assess the influence of soil nutrient content on crop yield, taking into account factors like climate, water availability, and soil type. The approach was tested on publicly available soil nutrient and crop yield datasets of soil samples collected from different regions and crops. The findings illustrate that the suggested model surpasses conventional approaches and attains remarkable precision in forecasting soil nutrient levels and crop yield.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In times of rapid global change, the ability to faithfully predict the development of vegetation on larger scales is of key relevance to society. However, ecosystem models that incorporate enough process understanding for being applicable under future and non-analog conditions are often restricted to finer spatial scales due to data and computational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning, particularly in the field of deep learning, allow bridging this scale mismatch by providing new means for analyzing data, e.g., in remote sensing, but also new modelling approaches. We here present a novel approach for Scaling Vegetation Dynamics (SVD) which uses a deep neural network for predicting large-scale vegetation development. In a first step, the network learns its representation of vegetation dynamics as a function of current vegetation state and environmental drivers from process-based models and empirical data. The trained model is then used within of a dynamic simulation on large spatial scales. In this contribution we introduce the conceptual approach of SVD and show results for example applications in Europe and the US. More broadly we discuss aspects of applying deep learning in the context of ecological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;The recent development of mobile surveying platforms and crowd-sourced information has produced a huge amount of non-validated data&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;that are now available for research. In the field of landscape analysis, with particular reference to geomorphology and engineering geology, images generated by autonomous platforms (such as UAVs, ground-based acquisition systems, satellite sensors) and pictures obtained from web data-mining can be easily gathered and contribute to the fast surge in the amount of non-organised information that engulf data storage facilities. The high potential impact of such methods, however, may be severely impacted by the need of a massive amount of Human Intelligent Tasks (HIT), which is necessary to filter and classify the data, whatever the final purpose.&lt;br&gt;In landslide hazard analysis, both UAV-surveys and the gathering of crowd-sourced information generate big-data that would require HITs before becoming usable in early warning, vulnerability assessment, residual risk estimation, model parametrisation and mapping. Very often, this an important limitation to the real-world applications that are actually feasible with the support of such systems. Examples of such HITs are the intelligent guidance of drones, the classification of fake news, the validation of post-disaster information.&lt;br&gt;Computer vision can be of great help in fostering the autonomous capability of intelligent systems to complement, or completely substitute, HITs. Image and object recognition are at the forefront of this research field. They are based on a number of computer-aided methods that rely on different degrees of interaction with the user, ranging from semi-automated object-based detection to deep learning by neural networks.&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;In this work, we present a new set of convolutional neural networks specifically designed for the automated recognition of landslides and mass movements in non-standard pictures that can be used for supporting UAV automated guidance and data-mining filtering. The deep learning has been accomplished by resorting to transfer learning of some of the top-performers CNNs available in the literature. Results show that the deep learning machines, calibrated on a relevant dataset of validated images of landforms, are able to supply reliable predictions with computational time and resource requirements compatible with most of the UAV platforms and web data-mining applications for landslide hazard studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

        "abstract": "Synesthesia is a psychological phenomenon where sensory signals become mixed. Input to one sensory modality produces an experience in a second, unstimulated modality. In &ldquo;grapheme-color synesthesia&rdquo;, viewed letters and numbers evoke mental imagery of colors. The study of this condition has implications for increasing our understanding of brain architecture and function, language, memory and semantics, and the nature of consciousness. In this work, we propose a novel application deep learning to model perception in grapheme-color synesthesia. Achromatic letter images, taken from database of handwritten characters, are used to induce synesthesia. Results show the model learns to accurately create a colored version of the inducing stimulus, according to a statistical distribution from experiments on a sample population of grapheme-color synesthetes. The spontaneous, creative mental imagery characteristic of the synesthetic perceptual experience is reproduced by the model. A model of synesthesia that generates testable predictions on brain activity and behavior is needed to complement large scale data collection efforts in neuroscience, especially when articulating simple descriptions of cause (stimulus) and effect (behavior). The research and modeling approach reported here begins to address this need.",

        "published": "No Date",
        "citations": 1,
        "abstract": "Effective and powerful methods for denoising real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing ECG signals. This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising EEG signals.  These methods are trained, tested and evaluated on different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database and for different simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG signals, single or multiple records). The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications where it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG record, and then to test on the same ECG signal, which would have some high level of noise added to it.   However,  for real-time applications or near-real time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part of an ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution put forth in this work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort), which was generated in a first instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e. ECG at rest).  Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real life situations to denoise the ECG signal. This corresponds also to reality, where usually the human is put at rest and the ECG is recorded and then the same human is asked to do some physical exercises and the ECG is recorded at effort. The quality of results is assessed visually but also by using the Root Mean Squared (RMS) and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) measures. All CNN models used an NVIDIA TITAN V Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 12 GB RAM, which reduces drastically the computational times. Finally, as an element of novelty, the paper presents also a Design of Experiment (DoE) study which intends to determine the optimal structure of a CNN model, which type of study has not been seen in the literature before.",

        "abstract": "<p>Apple is one of the most popular plants in the Indian-origin Kashmir valley, where it is grown on about half of the horticultural land. Every year, the apples from Kashmir are exported to other areas of the globe, creating a substantial amount of revenue. However, apple trees are prone to diseases like apple scab, alternaria leaf blotch, and apple rot, which devastate apple yields and cause major losses for apple growers. Disease in apple plants mostly originates in the leaves and causes significant losses to apple farmers. Consequently, the prompt detection or prediction of such diseases is essential in a country like India, where half of the population does farming. The early detection of apple plant diseases may enable apple producers to take the necessary precautions immediately to save the fruits from illness. The conventional methods of apple plant disease prediction are time-consuming and laborious, involving lab assistance to diagnose the apple leaves for possible diseases. With the advent of machine learning and deep learning, it is now possible to quickly determine if a plant is infected or not with reliable accuracy. In this article, we introduce D-KAP, a deep learning-based Kashmiri apple plant disease prediction framework capable of detecting the above-described diseases. For feature extraction and prediction, our model employs the advanced deep learning capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In conclusion, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in identifying apple plant diseases with an accuracy of 92 percent over testing samples. In addition, we also introduce a novel Kashmiri apple plant leaf dataset containing samples of three distinct diseases along with healthy leaves.</p>",

        "abstract": "As the impact of climate change intensifies, the frequency of short-duration heavy rainfall events gradually increases, posing a serious challenge to urban infrastructure and underground drainage systems. Assessing flood-prone areas and disaster extents relies heavily on manual surveys, lacking real-time and effective methodologies. Our study uses Mask R-CNN deep learning and closed-circuit television (CCTV) flood images to develop a real-time and effective flood detection model. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed flood image recognition model achieves a precision of 60.6%, a recall rate of 92.2%, and an F1 score of 73.1 for the flood category. These results signify the model's exceptional capability of the model in flood detection. Additionally, through on-site measurements of road dimensions and binary matrix-based area estimation, the average error is only 1.6%. This model can be applied effectively and serves as a reference for authorities to promptly determine the occurrence of flooding and the extent of the disaster, thus facilitating the formulation of more effective disaster response measures. The developed model exhibits promising potential for real-time flood detection in urban disaster management, providing a valuable tool for authorities to respond promptly to the dynamic challenges posed by climate change.",

Currently available 2D classification methods are effective at separating particles of interest from contaminants, but they do not effectively differentiate between polymorphs, resulting in heterogeneity in the 2D classes. As such, it is crucial to develop a method that can computationally divide a dataset of polymorphic helical structures into homogenous subsets. In this work, we utilized deep-learning language models to embed the filaments as vectors in hyperspace and group them into clusters. Tests with both simulated and experimental datasets have demonstrated that our method – HLM (Helical classification withLanguageModel) can effectively distinguish different types of filaments, in the presence of many contaminants and low signal-to-noise ratios. We also demonstrate that HLM can isolate homogeneous subsets of particles from a publicly available dataset, resulting in the discovery of a previously unknown non-proteinaceous density around tau filaments.",

In this study, utterances of four major regional dialects of the Assamese language, namely Central Assamese spoken in and around Nagaon district, Eastern Assamese dialect spoken in the Sibsagar and its neighboring districts, Kamrupi dialect spoken in Kam-rup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Kokarajhar and some parts of Bongaigaon district and Goaplari dialect spoken in the Goaplara, Dhuburi and part of Bon-gaigaon district were used. The classifier was trained on audio samples from each of the four dialects that lasted 2 hours. The CNN uses Mel spectrogram images created from two to four seconds divisions of raw audio input with varied audio quality. The performance of the system is also examined as a function of train and test audio sample durations. When compared to machine learning models, the suggested CNN model obtains an accuracy of 90.82 percent, which may be considered the best.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationThe definition of the genome distribution of the Myc transcription factor is extremely important since it may help predict its transcriptional activity particularly in the context of cancer. Myc is among the most powerful oncogenes involved in the occurrence and development of more than 80% of different types of pediatric and adult cancers. Myc regulates thousands of genes which can be in part different, depending on the type of tissues and tumours. Myc distribution along the genome has been determined experimentally through chromatin immunoprecipitation This approach, although powerful, is very time consuming and cannot be routinely applied to tumours of individual patients. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to develop in-silico tools that can effectively and rapidly predict its distribution on a given cell genome. New advanced computational tools (DeeperBind) can then be successfully employed to determine the function of Myc in a specific tumour, and may help to devise new directions and approaches to experiments first and personalized and more effective therapeutic treatments for a single patient later on.ResultsThe use of DeeperBind with DeepRAM on Colab platform can effectively predict the binding sites for the MYC factor with an accuracy above 0.96 AUC, when trained with multiple cell lines. The analysis of the filters in DeeperBind trained models shows, besides the consensus sequence CACGTG classically associated to the MYC factor, also the other consensus sequences G/C box or TGGGA, respectively bound by the SP1 and MIZ-1 transcription factors, which are known to mediate the MYC repressive response. Overall, our findings suggest a stronger sinergy between the machine learning tools as DeeperBind and biological experiments, which may reduce the time consuming experiments by providing a direction to guide them.",

Our results show that DLPAlign can get the best total-column scores on the three benchmarks. When evaluated against the 711 low similarity families with average PID ≤ 30%, DLPAlign improved about 2.8% over the second-best MSA software.Besides, we also compared the performance of DLPAlign and other alignment tools on a real-life application, namely protein secondary structure prediction on four protein sequences related to SARS-COV-2, and DLPAlign provides the best result in all cases.",

        "abstract": "Textural information, such as crystal size distributions (CSD&#8217;s) or crystal aspect ratios are powerful tools in igneous petrography for interrogating the thermal history of rocks and the timescales of processes affecting them [1-3]. Plagioclase feldspar especially has found extensive use as a reliable tracer for igneous thermal history and processes with both the apparent 2D [4] and 3D [5] morphologies shown to vary predictably with crystallization time.&#160;However, most textural studies, especially relating to 3D morphologies, require extensive data collection which can be cumbersome and time consuming when performed manually. The aim of this work is to present a holistic and automated workflow to enable the rapid extraction of igneous timescales from plagioclase textures through an automated approach. These developments are vital to better allow petrologists to make timescale estimates that can be used in conjunction with diffusion chronometry and more fully characterise the temperature-time paths of igneous rocks.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nWe propose the use of a deep learning-based computer vision technique, termed instance segmentation [6-7], to automatically detect the exact pixel-by-pixel location of each plagioclase crystal (crystal masks) in thin section images. By re-training the models using a custom set of segmented geological thin section images, one can re-purpose these models for petrographic use, limitations notwithstanding based on the training data. The model outputs can then be used to measure the physical properties of the detected crystals, such as size and aspect ratio, to automate the production of CSDs and aspect ratio distributions which are routinely used to interrogate the timescales of igneous processes.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nThe validity of our method will be showcased using a range of established volcanic&#160;and plutonic sample sets that have been previously well-characterised [4,8] through manual segmentation; these will include subglacial pillow basalts from Skuggafjoll and basaltic intrusions such as the Basement Sill in Antarctica and the Karlshamn dyke from Sweden.&#160;For sills, we make use of the correlation between plagioclase shape and crystallisation time [4] for rapid timescale determination straight from thin section photomicrographs to complement the information acquired from CSD&#8217;s. The vast amounts of data available from the automated segmentation of thin section scans are ripe for 3D shape studies over extensive sample suites to complement traditional textural approaches to timescales. These timescales will be linked to those obtained from diffusion chronometry such as Mg-in-plagioclase diffusion.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nReferences:&#160;\n\n\n[1] Cashman KV and Marsh BD (1988) Contrib Mineral Petrol 99, 277&#8211;291&#160;&#160;\n\n\n[2] Higgins MD (2000) American Mineralogist, 85, 1105-1116&#160;\n\n\n[3] Armienti P (2008) Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry. 69. 623-649&#160;\n\n\n[4] Holness MB (2014) Contrib Mineral Petrol 168, 1076&#160;\n\n\n[5] Mangler MF et al.

We use event catalogues including phase picks on a range of arrays in Scandinavia at regional distances (200-2000km), i.e., up to 3min separation between P and S arrivals, to train several deep learning models (PhaseNet and EQTransformer variants) using single stations within the arrays.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPhylogenetic analyses using morphological data currently require hand-crafted character matrices, limiting the number of taxa that can be included. Here I explore how Deep Learning and Computer Vision approaches typically applied to image classification tasks, may be used to infer phylogenetic relationships among bivalves. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on thousands of images showing species of 75 bivalve families. The predictions of the CNN on a large number of bivalve images are then interpreted as an indication of how similar these bivalves are to each other, are averaged by the families to which the species belonged, and visualized in a cluster diagram. In this cluster diagram, significantly more families clustered with members of their subclasses than expected by chance, confirming the feasibility of the approach. To address the issue of convergent evolution, two further CNNs were trained, on the same images but grouped by the orders and subclasses to which the species belonged. Combining predictions for the same images but on different taxonomic levels improved the inferred phylogenetic relationships also of families that the CNNs had not been trained on. Finally, this combined tree is merged with five published phylogenetic trees into a supertree, representing the largest single phylogeny of the Bivalvia to date, encompassing 128 families, including six exclusively fossil families and nine extant families for which presently no molecular data are available. Issues inherent to the approach and suggestions for future directions are discussed.",

Setting the price of an existing product is even more challenging, as it can significantly affect business growth, customer purchasing patterns, and brand perception. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages a deep learning Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network to predict changes in drug prices. Our model differs from existing approaches as it focuses on utilizing the stated reasons for price changes rather than product or market attributes for price change prediction. The MLP-based model is designed to learn complex patterns and dependencies within the drug price data, providing a data-driven solution for accurate forecasting. The text field containing the reason for the price change is pre-processed and then fed into the MLP neural network. We employ a Continuous Bag of Words approach to convert the text into a numerical format for model development. The model is trained on a diverse dataset, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which indicate the model's predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that the MLP-based model excels in predicting fluctuations in drug prices, showcasing its ability to adapt to the dynamic nature of the pharmaceutical market.</p>",

Then, these features were analyzed with the neighborhood component analysis and the features that contribute effectively to the classification were selected. The deep learning model including the convolution, pooling, and bidirectional long short term cell and fully connected layer was trained with the selected features. The trained model could effectively classify the subjects with ADHD with a deep learning model, support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis. The proposed approach was validated with an ADHD open access dataset (doi:10.21227/rzfh-zn36). Experimental results showed that the proposed approach can innovatively classify ADHD subjects from Control group effectively. The proposed method was able to classify 1210 test samples in 0.1 seconds with an accuracy of 95.54%.

Egocentric action anticipation is a task in which a future activity must be predicted using first-person footage. This project is a survey that aims to provide an updated view of advancements within this task, to guide architecture design for future implementations. This survey has chosen a range of publicly available egocentric action anticipation models. An analysis of the models revealed that this task's predictive architectures tend to fall into either a recurrent network or a transformer. The evaluation of the models on two datasets revealed that the transformer-based \"Adaptive Video Transformer' and `Temporal Aggregation' generally outperformed all the recursive architectures in this survey. These results demonstrate that the attention-based architecture of the transformer is valuable within vision prediction tasks and that future design of predictive architecture should focus on using attention-based models.",

        "abstract": "Surface expression of seismic rupture is a distinctive feature of large earthquakes, and the length of the surface rupture varies from several to several hundred kilometers depending on the magnitude of the earthquake. The structure and mechanical properties of fault zones strongly influence the behavior of earthquake ruptures, and detailed mapping and documentation of fault geometry such as fault bends, steps, branches, and their related segment geometry play a crucial role in determining the propagation and path of earthquake ruptures. The most precise method to map earthquake surface ruptures in detail might be manual mapping in the field by an expert; however, it takes a long time to analyze a vast area, and not everyone has access to the necessary expertise. As an alternative, rupture mapping based on remote sensing has been proposed to supplement the limitations of these field surveys.\nIn this study, we propose a robust model for automatic detection and analysis of morphological features of surface ruptures using deep learning based on previous research results. Additionally, a skeletonization technique was developed for morphological analysis of detected fractures, and fractures of complex structures on the ground were objectified as individual fractures. Finally, the geometric quantitative characteristics of individualized fractures, including crack location, length, width, and direction, were automatically extracted. By comparing the detection results of the proposed model with the ground truth confirmed by the expert using a line map, the reliability of the entire model could be confirmed.\nTo examine the applicability of the proposed model, the detection performance of various surface ruptures in localized areas was evaluated, and key characteristics, including rupture direction and pattern for extensive surface ruptures, were clearly identified. The satellite image-based surface destruction detection model proposed in this study can be used as a useful tool for field investigation and earthquake-related basic data collection by automatically detecting various surface destruction and deformations caused by earthquakes. Therefore, the proposed model, which enables fast and accurate fracture and fault mapping and quantitative analysis using high-resolution satellite data, is expected to be utilized as an important integrated solution. It would also be extremely beneficial in characterizing and comprehending the structural, geometrical complexity, and mechanical properties of fault zones.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA major research subject in recent times is Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to the growth and considerable societal impacts on health. So, the detection of AD is essential for medication care. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is critical for effective treatment and monitoring the time period between normal aging’s unavoidable cognitive loss & dementia’s more catastrophic degradation is common practice. The deep learning method for early diagnosis and automated categorization of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has suddenly gained a lot of attention since rapid advancement in the field of GANs approaches has now been used in the clinical research sector. Many recent studies using brain MRI images and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify Alzheimer’s disease have yielded promising results. Instead of adequately engaging with the lack of Real data, many research papers have focused on prediction. The main purpose of this paper is to do this by generating synthetic MRI images using a series of DCGANs. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this concept by cascading DCGANs that imitate different stages of Alzheimer’s disease & utilizing SRGANs to enhance the resolution of MRI scans. The purpose of this research is to come forward and tell if an individual might just get Alzheimer’s disease. CNN, DCGANs, and SRGANs are used in this paper to present a Deep Learning-based approach that improves classification and prediction accuracy to 99.7% and also handles the lack of data and the resolution of data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThere has been an increasing demand in recent years for detailed and accurate landslide maps and inventories in disaster-prone areas of subtropical and temperate zones, particularly in Asia. Most standard mapping methods require detailed fieldwork to be conducted by knowledgeable, skilled professionals. When predicting landslides, it is important to understand past landslide cases and prepare for situations in which the same phenomena occur. Developing automatic analysis methods using deep learning can contribute to the sophistication and cost of screening. This case study analyzed the potential of using deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for landslide detection with digital elevation models (DEMs) before the slide for deep-seated landslides (DLs) that occurred during Typhoon Talas. Here, we created 36,985 pieces of learning data from topographic information, which were then applied to a CNN using a multi-modal learning model. Eight types of numerical analysis images were created using the DEM as the learning data. The learning outcome achieved an accuracy of >0.856 for a 50 × 50 pixel window size CNN. This indicates that the decrease in the number of numerical analysis image types influenced the outcome. This study uses data from a limited range of DL sites in a topography specific to the accretionary zone. Although this CNN model is still in the initial stages of development, it accumulated many collapse cases and could contribute to disaster location screening, risk assessment, and hazard mapping during disasters.",

Early detection can help reduce the fatality of this disease. Deep learning models have proven very useful in disease detection and computer-aided diagnosis. In this work, we proposed a deep unsupervised machine learning model for early detection of diabetes using voting ensemble feature selection and deep belief neural networks (DBN). Dataset was obtained from an online repository containing responses of prediagnosed patients to direct questionnaires administered in Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The dataset was preprocessed and preprocessed. Features were reduced using the ensemble feature selector. The DBN model was pretrained and tuned to obtain optimal performance. The model was also compared with other models with no multiple hidden layers. The DBN performed at its relative best with F1-measure, precision and recall of 1.00, 0.92 and 1.00 respectively. We conclude that DBN is a useful tool for an unsupervised early prediction of Type II diabetes mellitus.",

Almost ten years ago, the release of Bitcoin marked the beginning of a new era of innovation in the financial sector. In this work, we outline what exactly defines a cryptocurrency, describing fundamental concepts, underlying technologies such as the blockchain, and subsequently the viability of this new digital financial asset. Building on this knowledge, we examine the infamous volatility of cryptocurrency prices, analyzing pricing data and the likelihood of these currencies, specifically Bitcoin, being in the midst of a financial bubble. We examine the prediction of prices, or rather the inability to do so, before introducing the Currency Analyzer web application developed as part of this work. Containing up to date prices, this application predicts the prices of Bitcoin using machine learning. The research, planning methodologies, technologies, and design and evaluation of this application are described in detail in this chapter, followed by a conclusion and future scope.",

        "abstract": "The significant increase in the number of interconnected devices has brought new services and applications, as well as new network vulnerabilities. The increasing hardware capacities of these devices and the developments in the artificial intelligence field mean that new and complex attack methods are being developed. This chapter focuses on the backoff attack in a wireless network using CSMA/CA multiple access, and it shows that an intelligent attacker, making use of control theory, can successfully exploit a sequential probability ratio test-based defense mechanism. Also, recent developments in the deep reinforcement learning field allows that attackers that do not have full knowledge of the defense mechanism are able to successfully learn to attack it. Thus, this chapter illustrates by means of the backoff attack, the possibilities that the recent advances in the artificial intelligence field bring to intelligent attackers, and highlights the importance of researching in intelligent defense methods able to cope with such attackers.",

One of the threatening aspects of peace is the availability of weapons to the general public. As a result, many dangerous situations arise, most notably street crimes. Traditional methods are not sufficient to deal with such situations. Consequently, the police and other security concerns need serious technological reforms to prevent such situations. In modern technology tools, deep learning has made great improvements in various areas of daily life, especially in object detection. This paper presents an efficient technique for detecting weapons from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, videos, or images. Upon the detection of the weapon, the concerned person is automatically informed to take the necessary action; without human intervention. For the first time, RetinaNet has been employed to detect weapons in real-time scenarios. RetinaNet has shown remarkable improvement in this domain, by achieving an average of 90% accuracy in real-time scenarios. With the emergence of quantum computing, many computer environments saw a revolution. Thus, we have also utilized quantum computing technology for real-time weapons detection using quantum deep learning. In this paper, quantum inspired RetinaNet (QIR-Net) is developed for weapons detection and amazing results are observed.</span>",

Cybercriminals have become more assertive on social media. As a result, numerous commercial and trade websites are hacked, leading to forced trafficking of women and children as well as a number of other cybercrimes. Due to this, it is important to identify social media crimes as soon as possible in order to avoid them. To do this, a machine learning technique to detect crimes early must be proposed. Long short-term memory networks are a type of recurrent neural network that can pick up order dependency in problems involving prediction of sequence.",

Elaboramos una encuesta ad-hoc, que permite medir el porcentaje de estudiantado que, previo a la experiencia, conoce la herramienta y, tras la experiencia, observar las preferencias del alumnado entre las alternativas “presentaciones tradicionales en el aula” o “webinario”. Además, recogemos su opinión sobre la adquisición de competencias derivables de la experiencia. Gracias a la implementación en distintos grupos y asignaturas haciendo uso de dos alternativas digitales, contrastamos si las respuestas son contingentes del grupo-asignatura en que se implementa la experiencia y/o de la aplicación informática utilizada. Los resultados muestran un incremento del alumnado que optaría por usar webinario frente a presentación tradicional tras la experiencia. El alumnado admite, gracias al uso de webinario, sentir un menor miedo-escénico, estar mejor preparado para afrontar el uso de otras nuevas tecnologías en el futuro y, sentirse más preparado para su futuro profesional. Además, reconoce el webinario como un instrumento válido para dinamizar la docencia en el aula. Los resultados no son contingentes de la asignatura o herramienta digital utilizada para realizar el webinario.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a significant global health concern and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. With the advancements in medical imaging technologies, such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), biomedical images have become an invaluable tool for diagnosing and monitoring lung cancer. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, has emerged as a powerful technique for automated analysis of biomedical images. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in deep learning-based approaches for lung cancer detection using biomedical images. The study encompasses a wide range of techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their variants, such as 3D CNNs and attention mechanisms. The review focuses on the various stages involved in lung cancer detection, including image pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. It discusses the challenges associated with these stages and highlights the solutions proposed by different studies.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In times of rapid global change, the ability to faithfully predict the development of vegetation on larger scales is of key relevance to society. However, ecosystem models that incorporate enough process understanding for being applicable under future and non-analog conditions are often restricted to finer spatial scales due to data and computational constraints. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning, particularly in the field of deep learning, allow bridging this scale mismatch by providing new means for analyzing data, e.g., in remote sensing, but also new modelling approaches. We here present a novel approach for Scaling Vegetation Dynamics (SVD) which uses a deep neural network for predicting large-scale vegetation development. In a first step, the network learns its representation of vegetation dynamics as a function of current vegetation state and environmental drivers from process-based models and empirical data. The trained model is then used within of a dynamic simulation on large spatial scales. In this contribution we introduce the conceptual approach of SVD and show results for example applications in Europe and the US. More broadly we discuss aspects of applying deep learning in the context of ecological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;",

In the field of landscape analysis, with particular reference to geomorphology and engineering geology, images generated by autonomous platforms (such as UAVs, ground-based acquisition systems, satellite sensors) and pictures obtained from web data-mining can be easily gathered and contribute to the fast surge in the amount of non-organised information that engulf data storage facilities. The high potential impact of such methods, however, may be severely impacted by the need of a massive amount of Human Intelligent Tasks (HIT), which is necessary to filter and classify the data, whatever the final purpose.&lt;br&gt;In landslide hazard analysis, both UAV-surveys and the gathering of crowd-sourced information generate big-data that would require HITs before becoming usable in early warning, vulnerability assessment, residual risk estimation, model parametrisation and mapping. Very often, this an important limitation to the real-world applications that are actually feasible with the support of such systems. Examples of such HITs are the intelligent guidance of drones, the classification of fake news, the validation of post-disaster information.&lt;br&gt;Computer vision can be of great help in fostering the autonomous capability of intelligent systems to complement, or completely substitute, HITs. Image and object recognition are at the forefront of this research field. They are based on a number of computer-aided methods that rely on different degrees of interaction with the user, ranging from semi-automated object-based detection to deep learning by neural networks.&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;In this work, we present a new set of convolutional neural networks specifically designed for the automated recognition of landslides and mass movements in non-standard pictures that can be used for supporting UAV automated guidance and data-mining filtering.

Combining graph neural networks and deep metric learning concepts, we expose a framework for quantifying molecular similarity based on learned embeddings separate from any endpoint. Using a minimal definition of similarity, and data from the ZINC database of public compounds, this work demonstrate the properties of the embedding and its suitability for a range of applications, among them a novel reconstruction loss method for training deep molecular auto-encoders. We also compare the performance of the embedding to standard practices, with a focus on known failure points and edge cases.",

        "abstract": "Synesthesia is a psychological phenomenon where sensory signals become mixed. Input to one sensory modality produces an experience in a second, unstimulated modality. In &ldquo;grapheme-color synesthesia&rdquo;, viewed letters and numbers evoke mental imagery of colors. The study of this condition has implications for increasing our understanding of brain architecture and function, language, memory and semantics, and the nature of consciousness. In this work, we propose a novel application deep learning to model perception in grapheme-color synesthesia. Achromatic letter images, taken from database of handwritten characters, are used to induce synesthesia. Results show the model learns to accurately create a colored version of the inducing stimulus, according to a statistical distribution from experiments on a sample population of grapheme-color synesthetes. The spontaneous, creative mental imagery characteristic of the synesthetic perceptual experience is reproduced by the model. A model of synesthesia that generates testable predictions on brain activity and behavior is needed to complement large scale data collection efforts in neuroscience, especially when articulating simple descriptions of cause (stimulus) and effect (behavior). The research and modeling approach reported here begins to address this need.",

        "published": "No Date",
        "citations": 1,
        "abstract": "Effective and powerful methods for denoising real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing ECG signals. This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) together with the more conventional filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard wavelet-based technique for denoising EEG signals.  These methods are trained, tested and evaluated on different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database and for different simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG signals, single or multiple records). The results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications where it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG record, and then to test on the same ECG signal, which would have some high level of noise added to it.   However,  for real-time applications or near-real time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part of an ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution put forth in this work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort), which was generated in a first instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e. ECG at rest).  Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real life situations to denoise the ECG signal. This corresponds also to reality, where usually the human is put at rest and the ECG is recorded and then the same human is asked to do some physical exercises and the ECG is recorded at effort. The quality of results is assessed visually but also by using the Root Mean Squared (RMS) and the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) measures. All CNN models used an NVIDIA TITAN V Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) with 12 GB RAM, which reduces drastically the computational times. Finally, as an element of novelty, the paper presents also a Design of Experiment (DoE) study which intends to determine the optimal structure of a CNN model, which type of study has not been seen in the literature before.",

        "abstract": "<p>Apple is one of the most popular plants in the Indian-origin Kashmir valley, where it is grown on about half of the horticultural land. Every year, the apples from Kashmir are exported to other areas of the globe, creating a substantial amount of revenue. However, apple trees are prone to diseases like apple scab, alternaria leaf blotch, and apple rot, which devastate apple yields and cause major losses for apple growers. Disease in apple plants mostly originates in the leaves and causes significant losses to apple farmers. Consequently, the prompt detection or prediction of such diseases is essential in a country like India, where half of the population does farming. The early detection of apple plant diseases may enable apple producers to take the necessary precautions immediately to save the fruits from illness. The conventional methods of apple plant disease prediction are time-consuming and laborious, involving lab assistance to diagnose the apple leaves for possible diseases. With the advent of machine learning and deep learning, it is now possible to quickly determine if a plant is infected or not with reliable accuracy. In this article, we introduce D-KAP, a deep learning-based Kashmiri apple plant disease prediction framework capable of detecting the above-described diseases. For feature extraction and prediction, our model employs the advanced deep learning capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In conclusion, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in identifying apple plant diseases with an accuracy of 92 percent over testing samples. In addition, we also introduce a novel Kashmiri apple plant leaf dataset containing samples of three distinct diseases along with healthy leaves.</p>",

We trained a decision-making model based on the convolutional neural networks and bi-directional long short term memory networks, and based on this model, we progressively aligned the input sequences by calculating different posterior probability matrixes.To test the accuracy of this approach, we have implemented a multiple sequence alignment tool called DLPAlign and compared its performance with eleven leading alignment methods on three empirical alignment benchmarks (BAliBASE, OXBench and SABMark). Our results show that DLPAlign can get the best total-column scores on the three benchmarks. When evaluated against the 711 low similarity families with average PID ≤ 30%, DLPAlign improved about 2.8% over the second-best MSA software.Besides, we also compared the performance of DLPAlign and other alignment tools on a real-life application, namely protein secondary structure prediction on four protein sequences related to SARS-COV-2, and DLPAlign provides the best result in all cases.",

The classifier was trained on audio samples from each of the four dialects that lasted 2 hours. The CNN uses Mel spectrogram images created from two to four seconds divisions of raw audio input with varied audio quality. The performance of the system is also examined as a function of train and test audio sample durations. When compared to machine learning models, the suggested CNN model obtains an accuracy of 90.82 percent, which may be considered the best.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMany macromolecules in biological systems exist in the form of helical polymers. However, the inherent polymorphism and heterogeneity of samples complicate the reconstruction of helical polymers from cryo-EM images. Currently available 2D classification methods are effective at separating particles of interest from contaminants, but they do not effectively differentiate between polymorphs, resulting in heterogeneity in the 2D classes. As such, it is crucial to develop a method that can computationally divide a dataset of polymorphic helical structures into homogenous subsets. In this work, we utilized deep-learning language models to embed the filaments as vectors in hyperspace and group them into clusters. Tests with both simulated and experimental datasets have demonstrated that our method – HLM (Helical classification withLanguageModel) can effectively distinguish different types of filaments, in the presence of many contaminants and low signal-to-noise ratios. We also demonstrate that HLM can isolate homogeneous subsets of particles from a publicly available dataset, resulting in the discovery of a previously unknown non-proteinaceous density around tau filaments.",

        "abstract": "Textural information, such as crystal size distributions (CSD&#8217;s) or crystal aspect ratios are powerful tools in igneous petrography for interrogating the thermal history of rocks and the timescales of processes affecting them [1-3]. Plagioclase feldspar especially has found extensive use as a reliable tracer for igneous thermal history and processes with both the apparent 2D [4] and 3D [5] morphologies shown to vary predictably with crystallization time.&#160;However, most textural studies, especially relating to 3D morphologies, require extensive data collection which can be cumbersome and time consuming when performed manually. The aim of this work is to present a holistic and automated workflow to enable the rapid extraction of igneous timescales from plagioclase textures through an automated approach. These developments are vital to better allow petrologists to make timescale estimates that can be used in conjunction with diffusion chronometry and more fully characterise the temperature-time paths of igneous rocks.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nWe propose the use of a deep learning-based computer vision technique, termed instance segmentation [6-7], to automatically detect the exact pixel-by-pixel location of each plagioclase crystal (crystal masks) in thin section images. By re-training the models using a custom set of segmented geological thin section images, one can re-purpose these models for petrographic use, limitations notwithstanding based on the training data. The model outputs can then be used to measure the physical properties of the detected crystals, such as size and aspect ratio, to automate the production of CSDs and aspect ratio distributions which are routinely used to interrogate the timescales of igneous processes.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nThe validity of our method will be showcased using a range of established volcanic&#160;and plutonic sample sets that have been previously well-characterised [4,8] through manual segmentation; these will include subglacial pillow basalts from Skuggafjoll and basaltic intrusions such as the Basement Sill in Antarctica and the Karlshamn dyke from Sweden.&#160;For sills, we make use of the correlation between plagioclase shape and crystallisation time [4] for rapid timescale determination straight from thin section photomicrographs to complement the information acquired from CSD&#8217;s. The vast amounts of data available from the automated segmentation of thin section scans are ripe for 3D shape studies over extensive sample suites to complement traditional textural approaches to timescales. These timescales will be linked to those obtained from diffusion chronometry such as Mg-in-plagioclase diffusion.&#160;\n\n\n&#160;\n\n\nReferences:&#160;\n\n\n[1] Cashman KV and Marsh BD (1988) Contrib Mineral Petrol 99, 277&#8211;291&#160;&#160;\n\n\n[2] Higgins MD (2000) American Mineralogist, 85, 1105-1116&#160;\n\n\n[3] Armienti P (2008) Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry. 69. 623-649&#160;\n\n\n[4] Holness MB (2014) Contrib Mineral Petrol 168, 1076&#160;\n\n\n[5] Mangler MF et al.

We find machine learning techniques as commonly used techniques for SFP as compared to deep learning methods which can produce more accurate results. Deep learning offers exceptional results in a variety of domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. In this study, we use three deep learning methods, namely, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BILSTM), and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) to predict software faults and compare our results with existing models to show how our results are more accurate. In our study, we use Chidamber and Kemerer (C&K) metrics-based datasets to conduct experiments and test our proposed algorithm. We conclude that LSTM and BILSTM perform better whereas RBFN is faster in producing the required results. We use k-fold cross validation to do the model evaluation. Our proposed models provide a more accurate and efficient SFP mechanism to software developers.",

        "abstract": "Automatic detection of seismic events in processing pipelines at the IDC and many NDCs is mostly done using beamforming on arrays; however, extensive use of single stations can improve the detection capability and accuracy of event location. Advances in deep learning methods enable faster and more accurate processing of large quantities of single station data not seen previously. We use event catalogues including phase picks on a range of arrays in Scandinavia at regional distances (200-2000km), i.e., up to 3min separation between P and S arrivals, to train several deep learning models (PhaseNet and EQTransformer variants) using single stations within the arrays. The models are trained on clips of 324s to capture the multiple arrivals. The models are then applied to various single stations in Norway to assess their generalization. We can detect events at a variety of back-azimuths and distances.&#160;&#160;\n\nFurthermore, we expand the existing deep learning models to provide predictions for back-azimuth and distance. This imposes physical restrictions on the models, leading to increased picking accuracy for the predicted phase arrivals. Moreover, this enables us to use the vast number of single stations available to efficiently detect and locate distant events.&#160;&#160;",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPhylogenetic analyses using morphological data currently require hand-crafted character matrices, limiting the number of taxa that can be included. Here I explore how Deep Learning and Computer Vision approaches typically applied to image classification tasks, may be used to infer phylogenetic relationships among bivalves. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on thousands of images showing species of 75 bivalve families. The predictions of the CNN on a large number of bivalve images are then interpreted as an indication of how similar these bivalves are to each other, are averaged by the families to which the species belonged, and visualized in a cluster diagram. In this cluster diagram, significantly more families clustered with members of their subclasses than expected by chance, confirming the feasibility of the approach. To address the issue of convergent evolution, two further CNNs were trained, on the same images but grouped by the orders and subclasses to which the species belonged. Combining predictions for the same images but on different taxonomic levels improved the inferred phylogenetic relationships also of families that the CNNs had not been trained on. Finally, this combined tree is merged with five published phylogenetic trees into a supertree, representing the largest single phylogeny of the Bivalvia to date, encompassing 128 families, including six exclusively fossil families and nine extant families for which presently no molecular data are available. Issues inherent to the approach and suggestions for future directions are discussed.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationThe definition of the genome distribution of the Myc transcription factor is extremely important since it may help predict its transcriptional activity particularly in the context of cancer. Myc is among the most powerful oncogenes involved in the occurrence and development of more than 80% of different types of pediatric and adult cancers. Myc regulates thousands of genes which can be in part different, depending on the type of tissues and tumours. Myc distribution along the genome has been determined experimentally through chromatin immunoprecipitation This approach, although powerful, is very time consuming and cannot be routinely applied to tumours of individual patients. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to develop in-silico tools that can effectively and rapidly predict its distribution on a given cell genome. New advanced computational tools (DeeperBind) can then be successfully employed to determine the function of Myc in a specific tumour, and may help to devise new directions and approaches to experiments first and personalized and more effective therapeutic treatments for a single patient later on.ResultsThe use of DeeperBind with DeepRAM on Colab platform can effectively predict the binding sites for the MYC factor with an accuracy above 0.96 AUC, when trained with multiple cell lines. The analysis of the filters in DeeperBind trained models shows, besides the consensus sequence CACGTG classically associated to the MYC factor, also the other consensus sequences G/C box or TGGGA, respectively bound by the SP1 and MIZ-1 transcription factors, which are known to mediate the MYC repressive response. Overall, our findings suggest a stronger sinergy between the machine learning tools as DeeperBind and biological experiments, which may reduce the time consuming experiments by providing a direction to guide them.",

Atmospheric correction (AC) retrieves the actual reflectance values, called surface reflectance (SR). Existing models are based on physics-based radiative transfer codes that rely on precomputed lookup tables, require many atmospheric parameters, and involve high computation costs. A few of these parameters are difficult to calculate and must be estimated. Deep learning models can be an excellent approximator to such physics-based AC models. In the proposed paper, we design, develop and analyze a deep learning end-to-end model. It is trained with a seasonally and spatially rich dataset to perform AC of Landsat 8 satellite images without explicitly considering atmospheric parameters. Experiments on model predictions are carried out to validate the effectiveness using Landsat data and ground measurements provided by RadCalNet. The results are encouraging because the model predicts SR values with good accuracy and establishes a high correlation with the reference data.</p>",

Setting the price of an existing product is even more challenging, as it can significantly affect business growth, customer purchasing patterns, and brand perception. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages a deep learning Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network to predict changes in drug prices. Our model differs from existing approaches as it focuses on utilizing the stated reasons for price changes rather than product or market attributes for price change prediction. The MLP-based model is designed to learn complex patterns and dependencies within the drug price data, providing a data-driven solution for accurate forecasting. The text field containing the reason for the price change is pre-processed and then fed into the MLP neural network. We employ a Continuous Bag of Words approach to convert the text into a numerical format for model development. The model is trained on a diverse dataset, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which indicate the model's predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that the MLP-based model excels in predicting fluctuations in drug prices, showcasing its ability to adapt to the dynamic nature of the pharmaceutical market.</p>",

Due to the unstable behavior of EEG signals caused by complex neuronal activity in the brain, frequency analysis methods are required to extract the hidden patterns. In this study, the feature extraction was performed with the Multitaper and Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition methods. Then, these features were analyzed with the neighborhood component analysis and the features that contribute effectively to the classification were selected. The deep learning model including the convolution, pooling, and bidirectional long short term cell and fully connected layer was trained with the selected features. The trained model could effectively classify the subjects with ADHD with a deep learning model, support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis. The proposed approach was validated with an ADHD open access dataset (doi:10.21227/rzfh-zn36). Experimental results showed that the proposed approach can innovatively classify ADHD subjects from Control group effectively. The proposed method was able to classify 1210 test samples in 0.1 seconds with an accuracy of 95.54%. The proposed method is promising for distinguishing subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder effectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs autonomous systems become more embedded into our environments, the ability of these systems to anticipate the future actions of humans will become invaluable for providing assistance and safety measures. Egocentric action anticipation is a task in which a future activity must be predicted using first-person footage. This project is a survey that aims to provide an updated view of advancements within this task, to guide architecture design for future implementations. This survey has chosen a range of publicly available egocentric action anticipation models. An analysis of the models revealed that this task's predictive architectures tend to fall into either a recurrent network or a transformer. The evaluation of the models on two datasets revealed that the transformer-based \"Adaptive Video Transformer' and `Temporal Aggregation' generally outperformed all the recursive architectures in this survey. These results demonstrate that the attention-based architecture of the transformer is valuable within vision prediction tasks and that future design of predictive architecture should focus on using attention-based models.",

        "abstract": "As the impact of climate change intensifies, the frequency of short-duration heavy rainfall events gradually increases, posing a serious challenge to urban infrastructure and underground drainage systems. Assessing flood-prone areas and disaster extents relies heavily on manual surveys, lacking real-time and effective methodologies. Our study uses Mask R-CNN deep learning and closed-circuit television (CCTV) flood images to develop a real-time and effective flood detection model. The results of our study demonstrate that the proposed flood image recognition model achieves a precision of 60.6%, a recall rate of 92.2%, and an F1 score of 73.1 for the flood category. These results signify the model's exceptional capability of the model in flood detection. Additionally, through on-site measurements of road dimensions and binary matrix-based area estimation, the average error is only 1.6%. This model can be applied effectively and serves as a reference for authorities to promptly determine the occurrence of flooding and the extent of the disaster, thus facilitating the formulation of more effective disaster response measures. The developed model exhibits promising potential for real-time flood detection in urban disaster management, providing a valuable tool for authorities to respond promptly to the dynamic challenges posed by climate change.",

        "abstract": "Surface expression of seismic rupture is a distinctive feature of large earthquakes, and the length of the surface rupture varies from several to several hundred kilometers depending on the magnitude of the earthquake. The structure and mechanical properties of fault zones strongly influence the behavior of earthquake ruptures, and detailed mapping and documentation of fault geometry such as fault bends, steps, branches, and their related segment geometry play a crucial role in determining the propagation and path of earthquake ruptures. The most precise method to map earthquake surface ruptures in detail might be manual mapping in the field by an expert; however, it takes a long time to analyze a vast area, and not everyone has access to the necessary expertise. As an alternative, rupture mapping based on remote sensing has been proposed to supplement the limitations of these field surveys.\nIn this study, we propose a robust model for automatic detection and analysis of morphological features of surface ruptures using deep learning based on previous research results. Additionally, a skeletonization technique was developed for morphological analysis of detected fractures, and fractures of complex structures on the ground were objectified as individual fractures. Finally, the geometric quantitative characteristics of individualized fractures, including crack location, length, width, and direction, were automatically extracted. By comparing the detection results of the proposed model with the ground truth confirmed by the expert using a line map, the reliability of the entire model could be confirmed.\nTo examine the applicability of the proposed model, the detection performance of various surface ruptures in localized areas was evaluated, and key characteristics, including rupture direction and pattern for extensive surface ruptures, were clearly identified. The satellite image-based surface destruction detection model proposed in this study can be used as a useful tool for field investigation and earthquake-related basic data collection by automatically detecting various surface destruction and deformations caused by earthquakes. Therefore, the proposed model, which enables fast and accurate fracture and fault mapping and quantitative analysis using high-resolution satellite data, is expected to be utilized as an important integrated solution. It would also be extremely beneficial in characterizing and comprehending the structural, geometrical complexity, and mechanical properties of fault zones.",

        "abstract": "The usage of Artificial intelligence in medical arena has proved to be a game changer in the detection and diagnosis of several medical conditions. In the current digital era, children with stressful medical issues are suffering from Deep Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (DOCD). This kind of mental stress occurs in children because of the continuous usage of gadgets such as mobile phone, playing games using play stations, watching videos on tablets, etc. In most of the possibilities, single children are the ones affected with several obsessions such as stubborn activities, fighting for selfish priorities and so on. In medical terms, these kinds of complex behavioral changes are identified as DOCD. Genetic behaviors sometimes in a few group of children are also noticed as a modality difference. As symptoms are psychiatric impairment, such a child remains isolated, abnormal silence, being obsessive and repeating irrelevant words, high stress or anxiety. All medical challenges could be treated as healthcare research metrics and the gradual increase in DOCD disorder among children of this generation can be considered too. Early detection of DOCD is essential as it can help in early diagnosis but techniques to do so is unavailable currently. Deep learning-an artificial intelligence method can be utilized to detect DOCD, diagnose and treat it and bring about a positive character in children. Behavior changes in children can be classified and detected using transfer learning algorithms. In COVID-19 pandemic situation, 3% of DOCD has increased to 10-15% as a disorder. This information is retrieved from children by monitoring negative activities, unusual behavior such as nail biting, removing spectacles and placing them in the wrong place, watching tablets, mobile phones and television for more hours. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), input such as MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) is used for experimenting the variations in behavior with the high dimension that are analyzed from the image dataset. Using Transfer Learning with Inception V3-, CNN generalization of misophonia level can be statistically analyzed to avoid overfitting problems. By employing AI techniques, the aggression level can be predicted using data augmentation method with better accuracy and a low error rate than the existing systems. In the research it is observed that using the model employing Inception-V3 transfer learning CNN a better prediction of aggression levels can be achieved in comparison to the existing CNN model used.",

However, due to the recent progress that has been made by medical science, epilepsy can be controlled for about 70% of the cases. To diagnose epilepsy, EEG, CT scan, MRI, etc. are some of the most common ways, but in this chapter, diagnosis using EEG shall be most focused upon. Although EEG can be considered a good way to decide upon the results of epilepsy proving whether a person is epileptic or not, it is not a completely reliable method. Hence, for its accurate detection we must use sophisticated techniques like CNN and LSTM that will provide a timely and correct diagnosis, reducing the chances of frequent epileptic seizures and SUDEP. Using anti-epileptic drugs cannot guarantee epilepsy prevention, and even if they do, these drugs come with some serious side effects, so people must look back to yoga for a probable permanent treatment.

        "abstract": "In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).",

        "abstract": "Driven by the unprecedented availability of data, machine learning has become a pervasive and transformative technology across industry and science. Its importance to marine science has been codified as one goal of the UN Ocean Decade. While increasing amounts of, for example, acoustic marine data are collected for research and monitoring purposes, and machine learning methods can achieve automatic processing and analysis of acoustic data, they require large training datasets annotated or labelled by experts. Consequently, addressing the relative scarcity of labelled data is, besides increasing data analysis and processing capacities, one of the main thrust areas. One approach to address label scarcity is the expert-in-the-loop approach which allows analysis of limited and unbalanced data efficiently. Its advantages are demonstrated with our novel deep learning-based expert-in-the-loop framework for automatic detection of turbulent wake signatures in echo sounder data. Using machine learning algorithms, such as the one presented in this study, greatly increases the capacity to analyse large amounts of acoustic data. It would be a first step in realising the full potential of the increasing amount of acoustic data in marine sciences.",

From  a  shallowmethods  point  of  view  (e.g.:  SVM),  since  the  following  mathematicalderivation of problem (9) in [3] is incorrect, we restart from problem (8)in [3] and we try to solve it with one procedure that iterates over the dualvariables until the primal and dual objective functions converge. In ad-dition we propose another algorithm that tries to solve the classificationproblem  directly  from  the  primal  problem  formulation.  We  make  alsouse of Multiple Kernel Learning to improve generalization performances.Moreover, we introduce for the first time a custom loss that takes in con-sideration pattern correlation for a shallow and a Deep Learning task.We  propose  some  pattern  selection  criteria  and  the  results  on  4  UCIdata-sets  for  the  SVM  method.  We  also  report  the  results  on  a  largerbinary classification data-set based on Twitter, again drawn from UCI,combined with shallow Learning Neural Networks, with and without thegeneralized quadratic loss.

To remove the noises from the images Gaussian filter is applied during the pre-processing. Bunch of fruits are classified into different classes such as apple, orange and banana. Also their quality is taken into account for preventing health hazards. In this work, the various combinations of fruits are classified into proper variety and after that the quality of the fruit is checked as whether it is defect or non-defect. For the first part, Convolutional Neural Network, AlexNet and MobileNetV2 are employed. MobileNetV2 achieved 100% accuracy for fruit type classification. In the second part, the same kind of fruits are fed into classifier for quality checking. The above said classifiers are used for defect classification also. For defect classification, MobileNetV2 gives 99.89% accuracy for orange and 100% for apple.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has established itself as a popular source of information. Using an effective approach to investigate the vast amount of information available on the internet is essential if we are to make the most of the resources available. Visual data cannot be indexed using text-based indexing algorithms because it is significantly larger and more complex than text. Content-Based Image Retrieval, as a result, has gained widespread attention among the scientific community (CBIR). Input into a CBIR system that is dependent on visible features of the user's input image at a low level is difficult for the user to formulate, especially when the system is reliant on visible features at a low level because it is difficult for the user to formulate. In addition, the system does not produce adequate results. To improve task performance, the CBIR system heavily relies on research into effective feature representations and appropriate similarity measures, both of which are currently being conducted. In particular, the semantic chasm that exists between low-level pixels in images and high-level semantics as interpreted by humans has been identified as the root cause of the issue. There are two potentially difficult issues that the e-commerce industry is currently dealing with, and the study at hand addresses them. First, handling manual labeling of products as well as second uploading product photographs to the platform for sale are two issues that merchants must contend with. Consequently, it does not appear in the search results as a result of misclassifications. Moreover, customers who don't know the exact keywords but only have a general idea of what they want to buy may encounter a bottleneck when placing their orders. By allowing buyers to click on a picture of an object and search for related products without having to type anything in, an image-based search algorithm has the potential to unlock the full potential of e-commerce and allow it to reach its full potential. Inspired by the current success of deep learning methods for computer vision applications, we set out to test a cutting-edge deep learning method known as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for investigating feature representations and similarity measures. We were motivated to do so by the current success of deep learning methods for computer vision applications (CV). According to the experimental results presented in this study, a deep machine learning approach can be used to address these issues effectively. In this study, a proposed Deep Fashion Convolution Neural Network (DFCNN) model that takes advantage of transfer learning features is used to classify fashion products and predict their performance. The experimental results for image-based search reveal improved performance for the performance parameters that were evaluated.",

Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can play a key role in the early detection and diagnosis of liver cancer. Therefore the main objective of this work is to detect the liver cancer accurately using deep learning. We propose a novel CAD framework using convolution neural networks and transfer learning (pre-trained VGG-16 and MonileNet-V1 model). The classification accuracy of HCC reaches 96%. The system consists of three stages: (i) data collection , (ii) Data processing and (iii) Data Analysis.",

The method circumvents the difficulty of directly training discrete  functions and reduces the quantization errors of ternary codes.

        "abstract": "<div>Hybrid FSO/RF system requires an efficient FSO and RF link switching mechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary benefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog, dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems. Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action, and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF’s consensus learned features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF, DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching cost significantly low.</div>",

The approach relies on two mechanisms:1) a mechanism that increases robustness at the expense of accuracy, and, 2) a mechanism that improves accuracy but does not always increase robustness. We show that an approach combining the two mechanisms can provide protection against adversarial examples while retaining accuracy. We formulate potential attacks on our approach with experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness. We also provide a robustness guarantee for our approach along with an interpretation for the guarantee.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>There is growing interest in imputing missing data in tabular datasets using deep learning. Existing deep learning–based imputation models have been commonly evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) as the predictive accuracy metric. In this article, we investigate the limitations of assessing deep learning–based imputation models by conducting a comparative analysis between RMSE and alternative metrics in the statistical literature including qualitative, predictive accuracy, statistical distance, and descriptive statistics. We design a new aggregated metric, called reconstruction loss (RL), to evaluate deep learning–based imputation models. We also develop and evaluate a novel imputation evaluation methodology based on RL. To minimize model and dataset biases, we use a regression imputation model and two different deep learning imputation models: denoising autoencoders and generative adversarial nets. We also use two tabular datasets from different industry sectors: health care and financial. Our results show that the proposed methodology is effective in evaluating multiple properties of the deep learning–based imputation model’s reconstruction performance.</p>",

        "abstract": "The usage of Artificial intelligence in medical arena has proved to be a game changer in the detection and diagnosis of several medical conditions. In the current digital era, children with stressful medical issues are suffering from Deep Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (DOCD). This kind of mental stress occurs in children because of the continuous usage of gadgets such as mobile phone, playing games using play stations, watching videos on tablets, etc. In most of the possibilities, single children are the ones affected with several obsessions such as stubborn activities, fighting for selfish priorities and so on. In medical terms, these kinds of complex behavioral changes are identified as DOCD. Genetic behaviors sometimes in a few group of children are also noticed as a modality difference. As symptoms are psychiatric impairment, such a child remains isolated, abnormal silence, being obsessive and repeating irrelevant words, high stress or anxiety. All medical challenges could be treated as healthcare research metrics and the gradual increase in DOCD disorder among children of this generation can be considered too. Early detection of DOCD is essential as it can help in early diagnosis but techniques to do so is unavailable currently. Deep learning-an artificial intelligence method can be utilized to detect DOCD, diagnose and treat it and bring about a positive character in children. Behavior changes in children can be classified and detected using transfer learning algorithms. In COVID-19 pandemic situation, 3% of DOCD has increased to 10-15% as a disorder. This information is retrieved from children by monitoring negative activities, unusual behavior such as nail biting, removing spectacles and placing them in the wrong place, watching tablets, mobile phones and television for more hours. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), input such as MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) is used for experimenting the variations in behavior with the high dimension that are analyzed from the image dataset. Using Transfer Learning with Inception V3-, CNN generalization of misophonia level can be statistically analyzed to avoid overfitting problems. By employing AI techniques, the aggression level can be predicted using data augmentation method with better accuracy and a low error rate than the existing systems. In the research it is observed that using the model employing Inception-V3 transfer learning CNN a better prediction of aggression levels can be achieved in comparison to the existing CNN model used.",

However, due to the recent progress that has been made by medical science, epilepsy can be controlled for about 70% of the cases. To diagnose epilepsy, EEG, CT scan, MRI, etc. are some of the most common ways, but in this chapter, diagnosis using EEG shall be most focused upon. Although EEG can be considered a good way to decide upon the results of epilepsy proving whether a person is epileptic or not, it is not a completely reliable method. Hence, for its accurate detection we must use sophisticated techniques like CNN and LSTM that will provide a timely and correct diagnosis, reducing the chances of frequent epileptic seizures and SUDEP. Using anti-epileptic drugs cannot guarantee epilepsy prevention, and even if they do, these drugs come with some serious side effects, so people must look back to yoga for a probable permanent treatment.

        "abstract": "In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).",

        "abstract": "Driven by the unprecedented availability of data, machine learning has become a pervasive and transformative technology across industry and science. Its importance to marine science has been codified as one goal of the UN Ocean Decade. While increasing amounts of, for example, acoustic marine data are collected for research and monitoring purposes, and machine learning methods can achieve automatic processing and analysis of acoustic data, they require large training datasets annotated or labelled by experts. Consequently, addressing the relative scarcity of labelled data is, besides increasing data analysis and processing capacities, one of the main thrust areas. One approach to address label scarcity is the expert-in-the-loop approach which allows analysis of limited and unbalanced data efficiently. Its advantages are demonstrated with our novel deep learning-based expert-in-the-loop framework for automatic detection of turbulent wake signatures in echo sounder data. Using machine learning algorithms, such as the one presented in this study, greatly increases the capacity to analyse large amounts of acoustic data. It would be a first step in realising the full potential of the increasing amount of acoustic data in marine sciences.",

        "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is a deadly brain cancer with a median patient survival time of 18-24 months, despite aggressive treatments. This limited success is due to a combination of aggressive tumor behavior, genetic heterogeneity of the disease within a single patient&rsquo;s tumor, resistance to therapy, and lack of precision medicine treatments. A single specimen using a biopsy cannot be used for complete assessment of the tumor&rsquo;s microenvironment, making personalized care limited and challenging. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a commercially approved alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma, but around 50% of temozolomide-treated patients do not respond to it due to the over-expression of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT). MGMT is a DNA repair enzyme that rescues tumor cells from alkylating agent-induced damage, leading to resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation results in decreased MGMT protein expression, reduced DNA repair activity, increased sensitivity to TMZ, and longer survival time. Thus, it is paramount that clinicians determine the methylation status of patients to provide personalized chemotherapy drugs. However, current methods for determining this via invasive biopsies or manually curated features from brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans are time- and cost- intensive, and have a very low accuracy. Authors present a novel approach of using convolutional neural networks to predict methylation status and recommend patient-specific treatments via an analysis of brain MRI scans. The authors have developed an AI platform, GLIA-Deep, using a U-Net architecture and a ResNet-50 architecture trained on genomic data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas through the National Cancer Institute) and brain MRI scans from TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive). GLIA-Deep performs tumor region identification and determines MGMT methylation status with 90% accuracy in less than 5 seconds, a real-time analysis that eliminates huge time and cost investments of invasive biopsies. Using computational modeling, the analysis further recommends microRNAs that modulate MGMT gene expression by translational repression to make glioma cells TMZ sensitive, thereby improving the survival of glioblastoma patients with unmethylated MGMT. GLIA-Deep is a completely integrated, end-to-end, cost-effective and time-efficient platform that advances precision medicine by recommending personalized therapies from an analysis of individual MRI scans to improving glioblastoma treatment options.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA major research subject in recent times is Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to the growth and considerable societal impacts on health. So, the detection of AD is essential for medication care. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is critical for effective treatment and monitoring the time period between normal aging’s unavoidable cognitive loss & dementia’s more catastrophic degradation is common practice. The deep learning method for early diagnosis and automated categorization of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has suddenly gained a lot of attention since rapid advancement in the field of GANs approaches has now been used in the clinical research sector. Many recent studies using brain MRI images and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify Alzheimer’s disease have yielded promising results. Instead of adequately engaging with the lack of Real data, many research papers have focused on prediction. The main purpose of this paper is to do this by generating synthetic MRI images using a series of DCGANs. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this concept by cascading DCGANs that imitate different stages of Alzheimer’s disease & utilizing SRGANs to enhance the resolution of MRI scans. The purpose of this research is to come forward and tell if an individual might just get Alzheimer’s disease. CNN, DCGANs, and SRGANs are used in this paper to present a Deep Learning-based approach that improves classification and prediction accuracy to 99.7% and also handles the lack of data and the resolution of data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractProtein-protein interactions (PPIs) play an essential role in life activities. Many machine learning algorithms based on protein sequence information have been developed to predict PPIs. However, these models have difficulty dealing with various sequence lengths and suffer from low generalization and prediction accuracy. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, RSPPI, combining Residual Neural Network (ResNet) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP), to predict PPIs based on the protein sequence physicochemistry properties and spatial structural information. In the RSPPI model, ResNet was employed to extract the structural and physicochemical information from the protein 3D structure and primary sequence; the SPP layer was used to transform feature maps to a single vector and avoid the fixed-length requirement. The RSPPI model possessed excellent cross-species performance and outperformed several state-of-the-art methods based either on protein sequence or gene ontology in most evaluation metrics. The RSPPI model provides a novel strategic direction to develop an AI PPI prediction algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning has reached a maturity level in which improvements depend less on network architecture than on the availability of high-quality training data or of usable prior knowledge. Because the former are very expensive to obtain, more and more groups are trying to use prior knowledge in the form of ontologies or other structured knowledge representation formats to advance the boundaries of AI. Here, I review two approaches to endowing stochastic models with prior knowledge: via probabilistic networks and via deep learning with priors. I analyse the latter in detail using AlphaFold, a well-known example of a deep neural network model, designed for the prediction of protein structures. While AlphaFold is an impressive example of a human cultural achievement that demonstrates one elegant and effective usage of prior knowledge for stochastic learning, it has limitations related to the upper boundaries of the types of processes which can be automated using Turing machines. As the analysis confirms, such machines can only compute inferences within the boundaries of established knowledge; they cannot create any new knowledge. AlphaFold can indeed predict many protein structures; but only those proteins which are homologous to proteins whose structures have already been experimentally established. Other proteins will still have to be analysed using experiments in the classical, time- and resource-consuming fashion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDiabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent issue among diabetic individuals, resulting in a constructive loss of vision in such people. If this problem is not diagnosed early on, there is no therapy available to restore vision. As a result, the only way out of this unreversible condition is to diagnose the sickness early on and cure it. The ophthalmologists use the \"fundus images\" of the patients' eyes, which are the retinal pictures of the patients, to maintain their eyesight. However, detecting an abnormality in a human eye with the naked eye of another person takes time, money, and can occasionally lead to misjudgment owing to subjective differences and concerns among ophthalmologists. As a result, we employ \"Deep Learning\" algorithms to diagnose diabetic retinopathy using fundus pictures in this article. As a result, a computer-aided diagnosis system is established, which leads to a reduction in misdiagnosis. Deep learning approaches have recently become the most popular ways for improving image recognition or feature detection systems' accuracy for both classification and regression. In this study, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image identification, training the neural network model with retinal pictures, and achieving excellent accuracies. In this work, the difficulties of various methodologies as well as faults with existing methods were examined.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDimensionality reduction is a data transformation technique widely used in various fields of genomics research. The application of dimensionality reduction to genotype data is known to capture genetic similarity between individuals, and is used for visualization of genetic variation, identification of population structure as well as ancestry mapping. Among frequently used methods are PCA, which is a linear transform that often misses more fine-scale structures, and neighbor-graph based methods which focus on local relationships rather than large-scale patterns.Deep learning models are a type of nonlinear machine learning method in which the features used in data transformation are decided by the model in a data-driven manner, rather than by the researcher, and have been shown to present a promising alternative to traditional statistical methods for various applications in omics research. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on a convolutional autoencoder architecture for dimensionality reduction of genotype data.Using a highly diverse cohort of human samples, we demonstrate that the model can identify population clusters and provide richer visual information in comparison to PCA, while preserving global geometry to a higher extent than t-SNE and UMAP. We also discuss the use of the methodology for more general characterization of genotype data, showing that models of a similar architecture can be used as a genetic clustering method, comparing results to the ADMIXTURE software frequently used in population genetic studies.",

Since flow around the individual particles is not resolved, the accuracy of the technique depends on the fidelity of the point-particle force laws used. The main focus of this talk is the use of emerging machine learning techniques along with physical insight into the averaging processes involved in the EL and EE techniques can yield closures that recover fully-resolved-like accuracy at orders of magnitude lower cost.The standard EL approach has been limited to (i) particles of size much smaller than the grid-scale and (ii) dilute flows where inter-particle interaction is weak. We will discuss recent developments that begin to ease these limitations. As the grid size approaches the particle size, we face the unpleasant prospect of force law becoming less accurate due to the self-induced flow generated, which corrupts the estimation of undisturbed flow velocity. We will discuss theoretical approaches to properly correcting for the self-induced flow. We will also present the data-driven pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model which rigorously extends the point-particle technique to higher volume fractions. This model systematically accounts for the precise location of all the neighboring particles. We will also present results from the application of deep learning where the algorithm is trained to predict multiphase flow.",

However, in the Ethiopic script unavailability of readymade datasets and the attempts of a few studies show that the script requires further investigation by applying different recognition techniques. In addition, image quality degradation and numerous characters in the alphabet are other major problems with Ethiopic-script documents. In this study, a convolutional neural network-based character recognition model for Ethiopic character recognition is proposed. The contribution of this work is the development of a character recognition model using a convolutional neural network. Method:-The model is designed using seven convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. Automatic features are extracted from each cropped 28 by 28 images using convolutional and max-pooling layers to prepare for recognition. Results:-The proposed model is trained and tested with customized datasets and achievement of accuracy 97%, which is a promising recognition result of the script. Conclusion:-In future works, the dataset should include all the letters, punctuation marks, and symbols found in Ethiopic scripts for both printed and handwritten text and increase the dataset size for different deep learning algorithms to get better results.",

However, current deep-learning approaches require high-quality annotated datasets to acquire and identify different mineralogical characteristics and properties. This is exacerbated by the time-consuming and error-prone labeling processes for the datasets. With self-supervised architectures matching supervised approaches in many computer vision tasks, it is timely to investigate the potential of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models in the geosciences. As a result, we use a self-supervised semantic segmentation model to identify and characterize minerals in thin sections, with the model attempting to obtain categories of interest from images without the need for human intervention in annotating the minerals. In this study, we adopted a Self-Supervised Transformer architecture and proposed SelfMin to automatically segment out pyrite minerals from other background gangue minerals in the thin section. Our proposed method achieved 80% in the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, indicating the model's ability to accurately segment minerals that were not labeled during the annotation process. This work describes the first use of self-supervised deep learning in mineralogical analysis. Further application of this proposed method would allow a robust and efficient advanced qualitative and quantitative mineralogical analysis. It also demonstrates how this technique can be implemented to avoid the need for a large volume of high-quality labeled datasets in other image-based deep learning geosciences analyses.",

Here we report preliminary findings in our development of DECIMER (Deep lEarning for Chemical ImagE Recognition), a deep learning method based on existing show-and-tell deep neural networks which makes very few assumptions about the structure of the underlying problem. The training state reported here does not yet rival the performance of existing traditional approaches, but we present evidence that our method will reach a comparable detection power with sufficient training time. Training success of DECIMER depends on the input data representation: DeepSMILES are clearly superior over SMILES and we have preliminary indication that the recently reported SELFIES outperform DeepSMILES. An extrapolation of our results towards larger training data sizes suggest that we might be able to achieve >90% accuracy with about 60 to 100 million training  structures, so that training can be completed within several months on a single GPU.

Thus, the examination of new proposals for fruit classification is worthwhile. In the present time, automatic fruit classification is though a demanding task.Deep learning is a powerful state of the art approach for image classification [1] This task incorporates deep learning models: Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for classification of fruits based on chosen optimal and derived features.

        "abstract": "<p>Apple is one of the most popular plants in the Indian-origin Kashmir valley, where it is grown on about half of the horticultural land. Every year, the apples from Kashmir are exported to other areas of the globe, creating a substantial amount of revenue. However, apple trees are prone to diseases like apple scab, alternaria leaf blotch, and apple rot, which devastate apple yields and cause major losses for apple growers. Disease in apple plants mostly originates in the leaves and causes significant losses to apple farmers. Consequently, the prompt detection or prediction of such diseases is essential in a country like India, where half of the population does farming. The early detection of apple plant diseases may enable apple producers to take the necessary precautions immediately to save the fruits from illness. The conventional methods of apple plant disease prediction are time-consuming and laborious, involving lab assistance to diagnose the apple leaves for possible diseases. With the advent of machine learning and deep learning, it is now possible to quickly determine if a plant is infected or not with reliable accuracy. In this article, we introduce D-KAP, a deep learning-based Kashmiri apple plant disease prediction framework capable of detecting the above-described diseases. For feature extraction and prediction, our model employs the advanced deep learning capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In conclusion, our framework produces state-of-the-art results in identifying apple plant diseases with an accuracy of 92 percent over testing samples. In addition, we also introduce a novel Kashmiri apple plant leaf dataset containing samples of three distinct diseases along with healthy leaves.</p>",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe analysis of fundus images for the early screening of eye diseases is of great clinical importance. Traditional methods for such analysis are time-consuming and expensive as they require a trained clinician. Therefore, the need for a comprehensive and automated clinical decision support system to diagnose and grade retinal diseases has long been recognized. In the past decade, with the substantial developments in computer vision and deep learning, machine learning methods have become highly effective in this field to address this need. However, most of these algorithms face challenges like computational feasibility, reliability, and interpretability.In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce a very powerful feature extraction method for fundus images by employing the latest topological data analysis methods. Through our experiments, we observe that our topological feature vectors are highly effective in distinguishing normal and abnormal classes for the most common retinal diseases, i.e., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Furthermore, these topological features are interpretable, computationally feasible, and can be seamlessly integrated into any forthcoming ML model in the domain. Secondly, we move forward in this direction, constructing a topological deep learning model by integrating our topological features with several deep learning models. Empirical analysis shows a notable enhancement in performance aided by the use of topological features. Remarkably, our model surpasses all existing models, demonstrating superior performance across several benchmark datasets pertaining to two of these three retinal diseases.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few years, the consequences of climate extremes have become increasingly concerning. According to IPCC projections (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), such events are to keep increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration. We aim at characterizing those changes, depending on carbon emission scenarios. But the analysis of climate simulations requires a huge computational power: data are available at a daily frequency, at a global scale at a ~125km spatial resolution, and depend on each realization of different climate models and scenarios.\nWe propose a novel method, a deep learning model, to address such big geospatial data sets. The state of the art for climate extreme detection with Artificial Intelligence focuses on satellite imagery, past events, or short-term forecasting. It is less prolific for future events or simultaneous analysis of several climate models and scenarios. In 2020, Sinha et al. developed an anomaly detection model to spot avalanches in satellite images. She tackled the same issue as ours: an unsupervised anomaly detection problem, with numerous unlabeled pictures of both normal snow surfaces and avalanche deposits.\nThe algorithm is based on a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE), a Neural Network that learns in an unsupervised setup. It is fed with plenty of images, with a small proportion of abnormal images, and learns how to compress and reconstruct them. The network has no information about whether the image is an anomaly or not. At the end of the training phase, it does a good job reconstructing normal images, but it struggles (high reconstruction error) with unusual samples.\nIn our case, the model is trained for each season on observations of a specific climate variable (e.g. temperature), on a given geographical zone. It is then applied to projection data (IPCC scenarios) on the same variable for the same location. The output images and losses are then post-processed as time series to extract statistical characterizations of the events, such as their frequency, intensity, or duration. The results are validated with several members (realizations) of the same climate model, and compared with analytical indices over a historical sample.\nThis work was supported by InterTwin project.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe widespread dissemination of several rumours and fake news has extremely affected many business organizations. Rumours or fake news spread and go viral on social websites causing significant social, business and political problem around the world. Fake news distorts public belief, affects companies reputation, disturbs community, reduces government integrity, makes business vulnerable and creates an enormous danger to the social constancy. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to detect rumour spread through tweeter. Various advanced machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost and Hard Voting classifier are applied to detect the rumours from online social media through tweeter and Facebook. The proposed model is based upon the CNN-BiLSTM-BiGRU approach which efficiently classifies tweets among rumours and non-rumours category. The proposed model provides 99% accuracy and outperforms other baseline models like Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Hard Voting. This hybrid recommender framework can be a more beneficial system to detect rumours at earlier stages from online platforms.",

The increasing hardware capacities of these devices and the developments in the artificial intelligence field mean that new and complex attack methods are being developed. This chapter focuses on the backoff attack in a wireless network using CSMA/CA multiple access, and it shows that an intelligent attacker, making use of control theory, can successfully exploit a sequential probability ratio test-based defense mechanism. Also, recent developments in the deep reinforcement learning field allows that attackers that do not have full knowledge of the defense mechanism are able to successfully learn to attack it. Thus, this chapter illustrates by means of the backoff attack, the possibilities that the recent advances in the artificial intelligence field bring to intelligent attackers, and highlights the importance of researching in intelligent defense methods able to cope with such attackers.",

One of the threatening aspects of peace is the availability of weapons to the general public. As a result, many dangerous situations arise, most notably street crimes. Traditional methods are not sufficient to deal with such situations. Consequently, the police and other security concerns need serious technological reforms to prevent such situations. In modern technology tools, deep learning has made great improvements in various areas of daily life, especially in object detection. This paper presents an efficient technique for detecting weapons from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, videos, or images. Upon the detection of the weapon, the concerned person is automatically informed to take the necessary action; without human intervention. For the first time, RetinaNet has been employed to detect weapons in real-time scenarios. RetinaNet has shown remarkable improvement in this domain, by achieving an average of 90% accuracy in real-time scenarios. With the emergence of quantum computing, many computer environments saw a revolution. Thus, we have also utilized quantum computing technology for real-time weapons detection using quantum deep learning. In this paper, quantum inspired RetinaNet (QIR-Net) is developed for weapons detection and amazing results are observed.</span>",

Cybercriminals have become more assertive on social media. As a result, numerous commercial and trade websites are hacked, leading to forced trafficking of women and children as well as a number of other cybercrimes. Due to this, it is important to identify social media crimes as soon as possible in order to avoid them. To do this, a machine learning technique to detect crimes early must be proposed. Long short-term memory networks are a type of recurrent neural network that can pick up order dependency in problems involving prediction of sequence.",

We extend the work [3] on a gen-eralized quadratic loss for learning problems that examines pattern cor-relations in order to concentrate the learning problem into input spaceregions  where  patterns  are  more  densely  distributed.  From  a  shallowmethods  point  of  view  (e.g.:  SVM),  since  the  following  mathematicalderivation of problem (9) in [3] is incorrect, we restart from problem (8)in [3] and we try to solve it with one procedure that iterates over the dualvariables until the primal and dual objective functions converge. In ad-dition we propose another algorithm that tries to solve the classificationproblem  directly  from  the  primal  problem  formulation.  We  make  alsouse of Multiple Kernel Learning to improve generalization performances.Moreover, we introduce for the first time a custom loss that takes in con-sideration pattern correlation for a shallow and a Deep Learning task.We  propose  some  pattern  selection  criteria  and  the  results  on  4  UCIdata-sets  for  the  SVM  method.  We  also  report  the  results  on  a  largerbinary classification data-set based on Twitter, again drawn from UCI,combined with shallow Learning Neural Networks, with and without thegeneralized quadratic loss. At last, we test our loss with a Deep NeuralNetwork  within  a  larger  regression  task  taken  from  UCI.

To remove the noises from the images Gaussian filter is applied during the pre-processing. Bunch of fruits are classified into different classes such as apple, orange and banana. Also their quality is taken into account for preventing health hazards. In this work, the various combinations of fruits are classified into proper variety and after that the quality of the fruit is checked as whether it is defect or non-defect. For the first part, Convolutional Neural Network, AlexNet and MobileNetV2 are employed. MobileNetV2 achieved 100% accuracy for fruit type classification. In the second part, the same kind of fruits are fed into classifier for quality checking. The above said classifiers are used for defect classification also. For defect classification, MobileNetV2 gives 99.89% accuracy for orange and 100% for apple.",

In this study, the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method was improved to segment the image into good quality super-pixels. Then, we used the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract of water bodies from Sentinel-2 MSI data using deep learning technique. In the proposed framework, the improved SLIC method obtained the correct water bodies boundary by optimizing the initial clustering center, designing a dynamic distance measure, and expanding the search space. In addition, it is different from traditional extraction of water bodies methods that cannot achieve multi-level water bodies detection. Experimental results showed that this method had higher detection accuracy and robustness than other methods. This study was able to extract water bodies from remotely sensed images with deep learning and to conduct accuracy assessment.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, the World Wide Web (WWW) has established itself as a popular source of information. Using an effective approach to investigate the vast amount of information available on the internet is essential if we are to make the most of the resources available. Visual data cannot be indexed using text-based indexing algorithms because it is significantly larger and more complex than text. Content-Based Image Retrieval, as a result, has gained widespread attention among the scientific community (CBIR). Input into a CBIR system that is dependent on visible features of the user's input image at a low level is difficult for the user to formulate, especially when the system is reliant on visible features at a low level because it is difficult for the user to formulate. In addition, the system does not produce adequate results. To improve task performance, the CBIR system heavily relies on research into effective feature representations and appropriate similarity measures, both of which are currently being conducted. In particular, the semantic chasm that exists between low-level pixels in images and high-level semantics as interpreted by humans has been identified as the root cause of the issue. There are two potentially difficult issues that the e-commerce industry is currently dealing with, and the study at hand addresses them. First, handling manual labeling of products as well as second uploading product photographs to the platform for sale are two issues that merchants must contend with. Consequently, it does not appear in the search results as a result of misclassifications. Moreover, customers who don't know the exact keywords but only have a general idea of what they want to buy may encounter a bottleneck when placing their orders. By allowing buyers to click on a picture of an object and search for related products without having to type anything in, an image-based search algorithm has the potential to unlock the full potential of e-commerce and allow it to reach its full potential. Inspired by the current success of deep learning methods for computer vision applications, we set out to test a cutting-edge deep learning method known as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for investigating feature representations and similarity measures. We were motivated to do so by the current success of deep learning methods for computer vision applications (CV). According to the experimental results presented in this study, a deep machine learning approach can be used to address these issues effectively. In this study, a proposed Deep Fashion Convolution Neural Network (DFCNN) model that takes advantage of transfer learning features is used to classify fashion products and predict their performance. The experimental results for image-based search reveal improved performance for the performance parameters that were evaluated.",

However,it can be reduced by early detection and diagnosis. With increasing use of Computed topography (CT) and Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for diagnosis, traditional classification cancer manually is a difficult and time consuming task showing limitations in large and diverse datasets. Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) can play a key role in the early detection and diagnosis of liver cancer. Therefore the main objective of this work is to detect the liver cancer accurately using deep learning. We propose a novel CAD framework using convolution neural networks and transfer learning (pre-trained VGG-16 and MonileNet-V1 model). The classification accuracy of HCC reaches 96%. The system consists of three stages: (i) data collection , (ii) Data processing and (iii) Data Analysis.",

Deep learning models can   learn and refine features at different levels of abstraction, enabling them to handle complex tasks in computer vision recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.  The ability to generalize from examples, coupled with the capacity to process vast amounts of data, empowers deep learning to achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide spectrum of applications. An argument for this ability is based on similarities between deep neural networks and the nervous system. In this report, we argue that despite the remarkable performance of deep learning, there are still gaps between deep learning and the nervous system that needs to be closed to enable deep learning doing tasks that currently only the nervous system can perform",

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has revolutionized AI by enabling computers to learn and make decisions similar to humans. Its neural networks with multiple layers can extract intricate patterns and features from complex datasets, leading to remarkable achievements in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. Meanwhile, meta-analysis, a statistical technique, has gained prominence in aggregating and analyzing data from multiple studies, providing more robust and reliable results. By synthesizing findings from diverse research, meta-analysis enhances evidence-based decision-making, identifies trends, and draws more accurate conclusions. This article presents an overview of deep learning and meta-analysis, highlighting their applications, benefits, and future prospects.",

The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog, dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems. Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action, and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF’s consensus learned features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF, DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching cost significantly low.</div>",

Because the data-intensive workflow has the characteristics of scattered data sources, large data scale and collaborative distributed execution at the cloud edge. It brings many challenges to the execution of workflow, such as data flow control management, data transmission scheduling, etc. Aiming at the execution constraints and data transmission optimization of data-intensive workflow, this paper proposes a workflow scheduling method based on deep reinforcement learning. First, the execution constraints, edge node load and data transmission volume of IoT data workflow are modeled; Then the data - intensive workflow is segmented with the optimization goal of data transmission; Besides, taking the workflow execution time and average load balancing as the optimization goal, the improved DQN algorithm is used to schedule the workflow. Based on the DQN algorithm, the model reward function and action selection are redesigned and improved. The simulation results based on WorkflowSim show that, compared with MOPSO, NSGA-II and GTBGA, the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the execution time of IoT data workflow under the condition of ensuring the execution constraints and load balancing of edge nodes.",

The QFA method converts a one-dimensional signal into a two-dimensional representation of the signal's oscillatory behavior in the frequency domain at different quantiles or a sequence of such representations that are localized in time. The DL image classifiers utilize these representations for signal classification. The benefit of this QFA-DL classification method, especially in comparison with the traditional method based on the power spectrum and spectrogram, is demonstrated by a numerical experiment using real-world data from a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe accurate and efficient detection of shoppers and classification by age group, gender, and cart or trolley in supermarkets is essential for strategic retail planning. With the advent of deep learning algorithms, various models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed for object detection in high-resolution spatial images. In this article, we proposed an architecture that consists of two phases: a first phase of shopper detection where we conducted a comparative study of three well-established CNN-based models, namely Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), You Look Only Once-v8 (YOLOv8), and Faster R-CNN, to detect shoppers by age group, gender, and shopping basket. Transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches were implemented to train the models. The evaluation results for accuracy and efficiency show that YOLOv8 achieved the best performance in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP), Frames Per Second (FPS) metrics, and visual inspection. SSD demonstrated an advantage in terms of detection speed with an FPS twice as high as Faster R-CNN, although their mAP was close on the test set. The trained models were also applied to two independent test sets, proving their transferability and the importance of higher resolution images for accuracy improvement. In the second phase, we conducted a comparative study among the classification models Residual Network 50 (ResNet50), the Visual Geometry Group(VGG) 16 and 19 family, and Densely Connected Convolutional Network 121 (DenseNet121). We found a positive prediction rate of 99.28% for the VGG16 model and 98.55% for VGG19, with the others having a rate that is not too far off.",

The entire structure can learn, from a wide variety of examples, how to classify scan-path patterns in a supervised manner and then recognize objects in digital images. This model provides a solution to the problems of selection in an image and information routing through the visual processing hierarchy. This approach is described in some detail and a performance example of scan-path classification is shown. The results confirm that our proposed system is both robust and fast.",

Atmospheric correction (AC) retrieves the actual reflectance values, called surface reflectance (SR). Existing models are based on physics-based radiative transfer codes that rely on precomputed lookup tables, require many atmospheric parameters, and involve high computation costs. A few of these parameters are difficult to calculate and must be estimated. Deep learning models can be an excellent approximator to such physics-based AC models. In the proposed paper, we design, develop and analyze a deep learning end-to-end model. It is trained with a seasonally and spatially rich dataset to perform AC of Landsat 8 satellite images without explicitly considering atmospheric parameters. Experiments on model predictions are carried out to validate the effectiveness using Landsat data and ground measurements provided by RadCalNet. The results are encouraging because the model predicts SR values with good accuracy and establishes a high correlation with the reference data.</p>",

        "abstract": "Locked and unlocked strategies are at the center of this article as ways of shedding new light on the cognitive aspects of deep learning machines. The character and the role of these cognitive strategies, which are occurring both in humans and in computational machines, is indeed strictly related to the generation of cognitive outputs, which range from weak to strong level of knowledge creativity. The author maintains that these differences lead to important consequences when we analyze computational AI programs, such as AlphaGo, which aim at performing various kinds of abductive hypothetical reasoning. In these cases, the programs are characterized by locked abductive strategies: they deal with weak (even if sometimes amazing) kinds of hypothetical creative reasoning because they are limited in eco-cognitive openness, which instead qualifies human thinkers who are performing higher kinds of abductive creative reasoning, where cognitive strategies are instead unlocked.",

Human performance accompanies human body shapes and their relative motions. Research on human activity recognition is structured around how the complex movement of a human body is identified and analyzed. Vision based action recognition from video is such kind of tasks where actions are inferred by observing the complete set of action sequence performed by human. Many techniques have been revised over the recent decades in order to develop a robust as well as effective framework for action recognition. In this survey, we summarize recent advances in human action recognition, namely the machine learning approach, deep learning approach and evaluation of these approaches.",

        "abstract": "<p>As social networks continue to gain widespread popularity, an urgent requirement arises to automatically identify and detect offensive language and hate speech. While there is a wealth of research and datasets available for English in this domain, there is currently a scarcity of research and datasets focused on identifying hate speech and offensive language in Persian text. This article introduces a 3-class dataset named Pars-HaO, consisting of 8013 tweets, to fill the gap in existing research. We collected the dataset by combining comments from pages that are more exposed to hate speech and using a keyword-based approach. Three annotators then labeled the tweets. In this study, we employed a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and four widely recognized machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) as a baseline. Then, we compared the base models with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and CNN models, each trained using the output of the last hidden state of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on the Pars HaO dataset demonstrated that the BERT with BiLSTM technique yielded the best outcome, achieving a macro F1-score of 70%. <br>\n  </p>",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia is a contagious disease that causes ulcers of the lungs, and is one of the main reasons for death among children and the elderly in the world. Several deep learning models for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images have been proposed. One of the extreme challenges has been to find an appropriate and efficient model that meets all performance metrics. Proposing efficient and powerful deep learning models for detecting and classifying pneumonia is the main purpose of this work. In this paper, four different models are developed by changing the used deep learning method; two pre-trained models, ResNet152V2 and MobileNetV2, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed models are implemented and evaluated using Python and compared with recent similar research. The results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning framework improves accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 99.22%, 99.43%, 99.44%, 99.44%, and 99.77%, respectively. As clearly illustrated from the results, the ResNet152V2 model outperforms other recently proposed works. Moreover, the other proposed models—MobileNetV2, CNN, and LSTM-CNN—achieved results with more than 91% in accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, and AUC, and exceed the recently introduced models in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.",

        "abstract": "With the fast development of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, automatic recognition of students’ facial expressions has received increased attention. Facial expressions are a kind of external manifestation of emotional states. It is important for teachers to assess students’ emotional states and adjust teaching activities accordingly. However, existing methods for automatic facial expression recognition have the limitations of low accuracy of recognition and poor feature extraction. To address the problem, this study proposed a novel deep learning model called DenseNetX-CBAM to improve facial expression recognition by utilizing a variant of densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) to reduce unnecessary parameters and strengthen the reuse of expression features between networks; moreover, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was integrated to allow the networks to focus on important special regions and important channels when representing features. The proposed model was tested using 217 video clips of 33 students in an online course. The results demonstrated promising effects of the method in improving the accuracy of facial expression recognition, which can help teachers to accurately recognize students’ emotions and provide real-time adjustment in online learning environments.",

Using the existing methods, manually performing macro-level classification and identification of personnel in intricate spheres is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient. The availability of several artificial intelligence models in recent times presents a new paradigm shift in object classification and tracking in complex settings. In this study, several compact and efficient deep learning model architectures are explored, and a new efficient model is constructed by fusing the learning capabilities of the individual, efficient models for better object feature learning and optimal inferencing. The new model construct follows the contributory learning theory whereby each fussed model brings its learned features, which are then combined to obtain a more accurate and rapid model using normalized quantization-aware learning. During the investigation, a separable convolutional driven model was constructed as a base model, and then the various efficient architectures combined for the rapid identification and classification of the various hardhat classes used in complex industrial settings. A remarkable rapid classification and accuracy were recorded with the new resultant model.",

        "abstract": "Instruments are categorized into the 5 groups in the Sachs-Hornbostel system: idiophones, membranophones, aerophones, chordophones, and electrophones. It might be easy to tell the Sachs-Hornbostel group that an instrument belongs to. However, distinguishing single instrument sound can be hard in monophonic or polyphonic music pieces and it is an important subject for musicians. Using computer science models can help musicians to analyze songs easily and fasten the speed of finding the instrument that are wanted by music producers or composers. This work aims to compare different models on particular instruments (monophonic sound) recognition which is an important problem in the field of music information retrieval. Jupyter Notebook is included for easy reproducibility. Among the six models chosen in this research: k-nearest neighbors(kNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Gaussian Mixture Modeling(GMM), Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), CNN is the most accurate model and SVM is the fastest model while CNN has the prospect of being improved because it can be adjusted manually.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been the most popular computational approach in the field of machine learning (ML), achieving exceptional results on a variety of complex cognitive tasks, matching or even surpassing human performance. Deep learning technology, which grew out of artificial neural networks (ANN), has become a big deal in computing because it can learn from data. The ability to learn enormous volumes of data is one of the benefits of deep learning. In the past few years, the field of deep learning has grown quickly, and it has been used successfully in a wide range of traditional fields. In numerous disciplines, including cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, deep learning has outperformed well-known machine learning approaches. In order to provide a more ideal starting point from which to create a comprehensive understanding of deep learning, also, this article aims to provide a more detailed overview of the most significant facets of deep learning, including the most current developments in the field. Moreover, this paper discusses the significance of deep learning and the various deep learning techniques and networks. Additionally, it provides an overview of real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be utilised. We conclude by identifying possible characteristics for future generations of deep learning modelling and providing research suggestions. On the same hand, this article intends to provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning modelling that can serve as a resource for academics and industry people alike. Lastly, we provide additional issues and recommended solutions to assist researchers in comprehending the existing research gaps. Various approaches, deep learning architectures, strategies, and applications are discussed in this work.",

However, due to the recent progress that has been made by medical science, epilepsy can be controlled for about 70% of the cases. To diagnose epilepsy, EEG, CT scan, MRI, etc. are some of the most common ways, but in this chapter, diagnosis using EEG shall be most focused upon. Although EEG can be considered a good way to decide upon the results of epilepsy proving whether a person is epileptic or not, it is not a completely reliable method. Hence, for its accurate detection we must use sophisticated techniques like CNN and LSTM that will provide a timely and correct diagnosis, reducing the chances of frequent epileptic seizures and SUDEP. Using anti-epileptic drugs cannot guarantee epilepsy prevention, and even if they do, these drugs come with some serious side effects, so people must look back to yoga for a probable permanent treatment.

Vision based action recognition from video is such kind of tasks where actions are inferred by observing the complete set of action sequence performed by human. Many techniques have been revised over the recent decades in order to develop a robust as well as effective framework for action recognition.

        "abstract": "<p>As social networks continue to gain widespread popularity, an urgent requirement arises to automatically identify and detect offensive language and hate speech. While there is a wealth of research and datasets available for English in this domain, there is currently a scarcity of research and datasets focused on identifying hate speech and offensive language in Persian text. This article introduces a 3-class dataset named Pars-HaO, consisting of 8013 tweets, to fill the gap in existing research. We collected the dataset by combining comments from pages that are more exposed to hate speech and using a keyword-based approach. Three annotators then labeled the tweets. In this study, we employed a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and four widely recognized machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) as a baseline. Then, we compared the base models with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and CNN models, each trained using the output of the last hidden state of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on the Pars HaO dataset demonstrated that the BERT with BiLSTM technique yielded the best outcome, achieving a macro F1-score of 70%. <br>\n  </p>",

        "abstract": "Pneumonia is a contagious disease that causes ulcers of the lungs, and is one of the main reasons for death among children and the elderly in the world. Several deep learning models for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images have been proposed. One of the extreme challenges has been to find an appropriate and efficient model that meets all performance metrics. Proposing efficient and powerful deep learning models for detecting and classifying pneumonia is the main purpose of this work. In this paper, four different models are developed by changing the used deep learning method; two pre-trained models, ResNet152V2 and MobileNetV2, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed models are implemented and evaluated using Python and compared with recent similar research. The results demonstrate that our proposed deep learning framework improves accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) by 99.22%, 99.43%, 99.44%, 99.44%, and 99.77%, respectively. As clearly illustrated from the results, the ResNet152V2 model outperforms other recently proposed works. Moreover, the other proposed models—MobileNetV2, CNN, and LSTM-CNN—achieved results with more than 91% in accuracy, recall, F1-score, precision, and AUC, and exceed the recently introduced models in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs.",

        "abstract": "With the fast development of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, automatic recognition of students’ facial expressions has received increased attention. Facial expressions are a kind of external manifestation of emotional states. It is important for teachers to assess students’ emotional states and adjust teaching activities accordingly. However, existing methods for automatic facial expression recognition have the limitations of low accuracy of recognition and poor feature extraction. To address the problem, this study proposed a novel deep learning model called DenseNetX-CBAM to improve facial expression recognition by utilizing a variant of densely connected convolutional networks (DenseNet) to reduce unnecessary parameters and strengthen the reuse of expression features between networks; moreover, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was integrated to allow the networks to focus on important special regions and important channels when representing features. The proposed model was tested using 217 video clips of 33 students in an online course. The results demonstrated promising effects of the method in improving the accuracy of facial expression recognition, which can help teachers to accurately recognize students’ emotions and provide real-time adjustment in online learning environments.",

Using the existing methods, manually performing macro-level classification and identification of personnel in intricate spheres is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient. The availability of several artificial intelligence models in recent times presents a new paradigm shift in object classification and tracking in complex settings. In this study, several compact and efficient deep learning model architectures are explored, and a new efficient model is constructed by fusing the learning capabilities of the individual, efficient models for better object feature learning and optimal inferencing. The new model construct follows the contributory learning theory whereby each fussed model brings its learned features, which are then combined to obtain a more accurate and rapid model using normalized quantization-aware learning. During the investigation, a separable convolutional driven model was constructed as a base model, and then the various efficient architectures combined for the rapid identification and classification of the various hardhat classes used in complex industrial settings. A remarkable rapid classification and accuracy were recorded with the new resultant model.",

Based on the establishment of Minnanese language emotion corpus, soft-Max is adopted as the algorithm of emotion recognition, and emotion recognition is carried out based on CNN model and BLSTM model. In view of the global and temporal characteristics of Minnanese language corpus, an algorithm model based on CNN-BLSTM fusion feature is proposed.Experimental results show that CNN-MOBLSTM fusion feature model is superior to CNN model and BLSTM model in recognition of Minnanese emotion, and it is an effective algorithm model.",

It might be easy to tell the Sachs-Hornbostel group that an instrument belongs to. However, distinguishing single instrument sound can be hard in monophonic or polyphonic music pieces and it is an important subject for musicians. Using computer science models can help musicians to analyze songs easily and fasten the speed of finding the instrument that are wanted by music producers or composers. This work aims to compare different models on particular instruments (monophonic sound) recognition which is an important problem in the field of music information retrieval. Jupyter Notebook is included for easy reproducibility. Among the six models chosen in this research: k-nearest neighbors(kNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Gaussian Mixture Modeling(GMM), Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), CNN is the most accurate model and SVM is the fastest model while CNN has the prospect of being improved because it can be adjusted manually.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning (DL) has been the most popular computational approach in the field of machine learning (ML), achieving exceptional results on a variety of complex cognitive tasks, matching or even surpassing human performance. Deep learning technology, which grew out of artificial neural networks (ANN), has become a big deal in computing because it can learn from data. The ability to learn enormous volumes of data is one of the benefits of deep learning. In the past few years, the field of deep learning has grown quickly, and it has been used successfully in a wide range of traditional fields. In numerous disciplines, including cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, deep learning has outperformed well-known machine learning approaches. In order to provide a more ideal starting point from which to create a comprehensive understanding of deep learning, also, this article aims to provide a more detailed overview of the most significant facets of deep learning, including the most current developments in the field. Moreover, this paper discusses the significance of deep learning and the various deep learning techniques and networks. Additionally, it provides an overview of real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be utilised. We conclude by identifying possible characteristics for future generations of deep learning modelling and providing research suggestions. On the same hand, this article intends to provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning modelling that can serve as a resource for academics and industry people alike. Lastly, we provide additional issues and recommended solutions to assist researchers in comprehending the existing research gaps. Various approaches, deep learning architectures, strategies, and applications are discussed in this work.",

        "abstract": "Natural products produced by microorganisms constitute an important source of essential pharmaceuticals, including antimicrobial and anti-tumor drugs. These bioactive molecules are microbial secondary metabolites synthesized by co-localized genes termed Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). The rapid increase of microbial genomics resources, due to the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies, has spurred the development of computational methods for microbial genome mining for BGC discovery. Current machine learning methods, however, have limited successes in uncovering novel BGCs due to an excessive number of false positives in their predictions. To this end, we propose Deep-BGCpred, a framework that effectively addresses the aforementioned issue by improving a deep learning model termed DeepBGC. The new model embeds multi-source protein family domains and employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model to boost accuracy for BGC identifications. In particular, it integrates two customized strategies, sliding window strategy and dual-model serial screening, to improve the model’s performance stability and reduce the number of false positive in BGC predictions. We compare the proposed model against other well-established methods on common benchmarks and achieve new state-of-the-art results with convincing evidences. We expect that researchers working on genome mining for natural products may be greatly benefited from our newly proposed method, Deep-BGCpred.",

        "abstract": "In any industry, attrition is a big problem, whether it is about employee attrition of an organization or customer attrition of an e-commerce site. If we can accurately predict which customer or employee will leave their current company or organization, then it will save much time, effort, and cost of the employer and help them to hire or acquire substitutes in advance, and it would not create a problem in the ongoing progress of an organization. In this chapter, a comparative analysis between various machine learning approaches such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression is presented. The presented result will help us in identifying the behavior of employees who can be attired over the next time. Experimental results reveal that the logistic regression approach can reach up to 86% accuracy over other machine learning approaches. ",

        "abstract": "The automatic character recognition of historic documents gained more attention from scholars recently, due to the big improvements in computer vision, image processing, and digitization. While Neural Networks, the current state-of-the-art models used for image recognition, are very performant, they typically suffer from using large amounts of training data. In our study we manually built our own relatively small dataset of 404 characters by cropping letter images from a popular historic manuscript, the Electronic Beowulf. To compensate for the small dataset we use ImageDataGenerator, a Python library was used to augment our Beowulf manuscript’s dataset. The training dataset was augmented once, twice, and thrice, which we call resampling 1, resampling 2, and resampling 3, respectively. To classify the manuscript’s character images efficiently, we developed a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. We conducted a comparative analysis of the results achieved by our proposed model with other machine learning (ML) models such as support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and XGBoost. We used pretrained models such as VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet50 to extract features from character images. We then trained and tested the above ML models and recorded the results. Moreover, we validated our proposed CNN model against the well-established MNIST dataset. Our proposed CNN model achieves very good recognition accuracies of 88.67%, 90.91%, and 98.86% in the cases of resampling 1, resampling 2, and resampling 3, respectively, for the Beowulf manuscript’s data. Additionally, our CNN model achieves the benchmark recognition accuracy of 99.03% for the MNIST dataset.",

        "abstract": "IMERG is a global satellite-based precipitation dataset, produced by NASA. It has provided valuable rainfall information to facilitate the design or the operation of the disaster and risk management worldwide. In operation, NASA offers three types of IMERG Level 3 (L3) products, with different levels of trade-offs in terms of time latency and accuracy. These are Early run (4-hour latency), Late run (14-hour latency) and Final run(3.5-month latency). The final-run product integrates multi-sensor retrievals and provides the highest-quality precipitation estimates among three IMERG products. It however suffers from a long processing latency, which hinders its applicability to near real-time applications. In the past 10 years, deep learning techniques have made significant breakthroughs in various scientific fields, including short-term rainfall forecasting. Deep learning models have shown to have the potential to learn the complex variations in weather systems and to outperform the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) in terms of short lead-time predictability and the required computational resources for operation.&#160;In this research, we would like to explore the potential of deep learning (DL) in generating high-quality satellite-based precipitation product with low latency. More specifically, we investigate if DL models can learn the difference between Final- and Early-run products, and thus predict a Final-run-like product using Early-run product as input. Low-latency yet high-quality IMERG precipitation product can be therefore obtained. Various DL techniques are being tested in this work, including Auto-Encoder(AE), ConvLSTM and Deep Generative model. IMERG data between 2018 and 2020 over a rectangular area centred in the UK is used for model training and testing, and ground rain gauge records will be used to evaluate the performance of the original and predicted products. This pilot includes both ocean and land regions, which enables the comparison of the model performance between two different surface conditions. Preliminary analysis suggests that given patterns do exist in the differences between Early- and Final-run products, and the capacity of the selected DL models to learn the differences will be further investigated. The proposed work is of great potential to improve the applicability of IMERG products in an operational context.",

Biomechanical loading and the utilization of exoskeletons have been demonstrated to enhance the everyday life of patients. However the reliance on traditional control algorithms limit the use of this treatment in dynamic movements and in diseases where the model of the underlying condition is not available or where the model is susceptible to change.\n\nHere we present a novel deep reinforcement learning based control strategy capable of handling a wide range of tremors across multiple dynamic movements. Our approach incorporates the use of encoder networks, modified buffers and heavily shaped rewards to create actuation forces for the exoskeleton.\n\nWe find that the control strategy is capable of efficiently suppressing tremors with different frequencies originating from multiple concurrent joint axes, present in a multitude of dynamic movements.",

        "abstract": "Asphyxiation associated with metabolic acidosis is one of the common causes of fetal deaths. The paper aims to develop a feature extraction and prediction algorithm capable of identifying most of the features in the SISPORTO software package and late and variable decelerations. The resulting features were used for classification based on umbilical cord pH data. The algorithms developed here were used to predict cord pH levels. The prediction system assists the obstetricians in assessing the state of the fetus better than the category methods, as only about 30% of the patients in the pathological category suffer from acidosis, while the majority of acidotic babies were in the suspect category, which is considered lower risk. By predicting the direct indicator of acidosis, umbilical cord pH, this work demonstrates a methodology, which uses fetal heart rate and uterine activity, to identify acidosis. This paper introduces a forecasting model based on deep learning to predict heart rate and uterine contractions, integrated with the classification algorithm, resulting in a robust tool for predictive fetal monitoring. The hybrid algorithm resulted in a model capable of providing future conditions of the fetus, which obstetricians can use for diagnosis and planning interventions. The ensemble classification algorithm had a test accuracy of 85% (n = 24) in predicting fetal acidosis on the features extracted from the cardiotocography data. When integrated with the classification model, the results from the prediction model (long short-term memory network) can effectively identify fetal acidosis 2 or 4 min in the future.",

Nevertheless, designing an effective iterative\nlearning control scheme is still a critical problem for complex batch\nprocesses with non-repetitive nature and model mismatch. In this paper,\nwe propose a two-dimensional iterative learning control-reinforcement\nlearning (2D ILC-RL) control scheme composed of a two-dimensional ILC\ncontroller and a two-dimensional DRL compensator. Based on the 2D system\ntheory, the 2D ILC controller is proposed to ensure the primary control\nperformance and its stability and convergence are verified. Meanwhile,\nthe DRL compensator counteracts the negative impact of the model\nmismatch and the non-repetitive nature. In addition, we proposed a\nreal-time implementation scheme to guarantee the safety of the practical\nbatch systems compared to the conventional online training method.\nFinally, the simulation results in two chemical batch processes\ndemonstrate the proposed control method’s effectiveness, significant\ncontrol performance, and strong robustness.",

        "abstract": "<p>As social networks continue to gain widespread popularity, an urgent requirement arises to automatically identify and detect offensive language and hate speech. While there is a wealth of research and datasets available for English in this domain, there is currently a scarcity of research and datasets focused on identifying hate speech and offensive language in Persian text. This article introduces a 3-class dataset named Pars-HaO, consisting of 8013 tweets, to fill the gap in existing research. We collected the dataset by combining comments from pages that are more exposed to hate speech and using a keyword-based approach. Three annotators then labeled the tweets. In this study, we employed a combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and four widely recognized machine learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) as a baseline. Then, we compared the base models with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and CNN models, each trained using the output of the last hidden state of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Experimental results on the Pars HaO dataset demonstrated that the BERT with BiLSTM technique yielded the best outcome, achieving a macro F1-score of 70%. <br>\n  </p>",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe design of an automatic solver for mathematical word problems (MWPs) dates back to the early 1960s and regained booming attention in recent years, owing to revolutionary advances in deep learning. Its objective is to parse the human-readable word problems into machine-understandable logical expressions. The problem is challenging due to the existence of a substantial semantic gap. To a certain extent, MWPs have been recognized as good test beds to evaluate the intelligence level of agents in terms of natural language understanding and automatic reasoning. The successful solving of MWPs can benefit online tutoring and constitute a milestone toward general AI. In this chapter, we present a general introduction to the technical evolution trend for MWP solvers in recent decades and pay particular attention to recent advancement with deep learning models. We also report their performances on public benchmark datasets, which can update readers’ understandings of the latest status of automatic math problem solvers.",

        "abstract": "AbstractUsing a relatively small training set of ∼16 thousand images from macromolecular crystallisation experiments, we compare classification results obtained with four of the most widely-used convolutional deep-learning network architectures that can be implemented without the need for extensive computational resources. We show that the classifiers have different strengths that can be combined to provide an ensemble classifier achieving a classification accuracy comparable to that obtained by a large consortium initiative. We use eight classes to effectively rank the experimental outcomes, thereby providing detailed information that can be used with routine crystallography experiments to automatically identify crystal formation for drug discovery and pave the way for further exploration of the relationship between crystal formation and crystallisation conditions.Author summaryX-ray crystallography can provide structural information on the molecules that play important roles in cell function and allow interactions vital for drug design to be elucidated. However, the technique requires the molecules to be crystallised and obtaining sufficiently high-quality crystals can require hundreds of experiments under different conditions. Robots have been designed to perform the microscopic experiments with imaging systems to record the results over time but automated classification of all these images is becoming essential. In this work we compare different classifiers that can be used without the need for vast computational resources and show that an ensemble classifier which combines the different strengths of four deep-learning networks is able to correctly classify the experimental results into one of eight different categories 94% of the time.",

Based on the establishment of Minnanese language emotion corpus, soft-Max is adopted as the algorithm of emotion recognition, and emotion recognition is carried out based on CNN model and BLSTM model. In view of the global and temporal characteristics of Minnanese language corpus, an algorithm model based on CNN-BLSTM fusion feature is proposed.Experimental results show that CNN-MOBLSTM fusion feature model is superior to CNN model and BLSTM model in recognition of Minnanese emotion, and it is an effective algorithm model.",

It might be easy to tell the Sachs-Hornbostel group that an instrument belongs to. However, distinguishing single instrument sound can be hard in monophonic or polyphonic music pieces and it is an important subject for musicians. Using computer science models can help musicians to analyze songs easily and fasten the speed of finding the instrument that are wanted by music producers or composers. This work aims to compare different models on particular instruments (monophonic sound) recognition which is an important problem in the field of music information retrieval. Jupyter Notebook is included for easy reproducibility. Among the six models chosen in this research: k-nearest neighbors(kNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM), Gaussian Mixture Modeling(GMM), Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN), CNN is the most accurate model and SVM is the fastest model while CNN has the prospect of being improved because it can be adjusted manually.",

Using the existing methods, manually performing macro-level classification and identification of personnel in intricate spheres is tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient. The availability of several artificial intelligence models in recent times presents a new paradigm shift in object classification and tracking in complex settings. In this study, several compact and efficient deep learning model architectures are explored, and a new efficient model is constructed by fusing the learning capabilities of the individual, efficient models for better object feature learning and optimal inferencing. The new model construct follows the contributory learning theory whereby each fussed model brings its learned features, which are then combined to obtain a more accurate and rapid model using normalized quantization-aware learning. During the investigation, a separable convolutional driven model was constructed as a base model, and then the various efficient architectures combined for the rapid identification and classification of the various hardhat classes used in complex industrial settings. A remarkable rapid classification and accuracy were recorded with the new resultant model.",

        "abstract": "Natural products produced by microorganisms constitute an important source of essential pharmaceuticals, including antimicrobial and anti-tumor drugs. These bioactive molecules are microbial secondary metabolites synthesized by co-localized genes termed Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). The rapid increase of microbial genomics resources, due to the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies, has spurred the development of computational methods for microbial genome mining for BGC discovery. Current machine learning methods, however, have limited successes in uncovering novel BGCs due to an excessive number of false positives in their predictions. To this end, we propose Deep-BGCpred, a framework that effectively addresses the aforementioned issue by improving a deep learning model termed DeepBGC. The new model embeds multi-source protein family domains and employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model to boost accuracy for BGC identifications. In particular, it integrates two customized strategies, sliding window strategy and dual-model serial screening, to improve the model’s performance stability and reduce the number of false positive in BGC predictions. We compare the proposed model against other well-established methods on common benchmarks and achieve new state-of-the-art results with convincing evidences. We expect that researchers working on genome mining for natural products may be greatly benefited from our newly proposed method, Deep-BGCpred.",

        "abstract": "In any industry, attrition is a big problem, whether it is about employee attrition of an organization or customer attrition of an e-commerce site. If we can accurately predict which customer or employee will leave their current company or organization, then it will save much time, effort, and cost of the employer and help them to hire or acquire substitutes in advance, and it would not create a problem in the ongoing progress of an organization. In this chapter, a comparative analysis between various machine learning approaches such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression is presented. The presented result will help us in identifying the behavior of employees who can be attired over the next time. Experimental results reveal that the logistic regression approach can reach up to 86% accuracy over other machine learning approaches. ",

        "abstract": "A bridge inspection needs a lot of costs. It causes a lack of engineers and budget. So, some local governments couldn’t complete the bridge’s aggressive preventive maintenance in Japan. Recently, deep learning-based damage detection methods have been studied by many researchers to reduce the cost of the bridge’s aggressive preventive maintenance. This kind of method could detect the damage to the bridge by photo image with a detection model which has been trained with a large training dataset. In contrast to the increase in dataset size, the effectiveness of the quality of training data is not discussed enough. In this paper, the ratio of negative samples in the training data is regarded as the quality of training data. In this study, we targeted the automatic detection process of the rebar exposure and the peeling on the surface of bridges. The effects of the ratio of the negative example data in a training dataset have been evaluated. In this study, the negative sample means the annotated data with no target damage. The negative sample image is the part of a bridge but does not include target damages. Many previous studies generate this kind of image when generating annotation data from real bridge photo images, but do not utilize it. A three-fold cross-validation method has been adopted to keep the robustness of the detection. The seven different detection models have trained with seven different training dataset which has different negative sample ratios. As a result of comparing the detection results of each model, the influence of the negative example data on the training data was confirmed. There was a peak of the recall curve in the middle of increasing the negative sample ratios. The correct negative sample ratio could improve the accuracy of damage detection.",

        "abstract": "Background: Pediatric or congenital cataract (CC) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in children worldwide. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of artificial intelligence, has the potential to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in various medical fields.\r\nResearch Objectives: summarize and evaluate the diagnostic and prediction capabilities of DL algorithms for CC.\r\nMethods: From 1st February to 25th March 2023, a literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, and EBSCO, as well as alternative sources such as Google Scholar. Search terms included “pediatric/congenital cataract”, “artificial intelligence\", \"deep learning\", \"convolutional neural network\", “diagnosis”, \"screening\", \"prediction\" and other relevant synonyms. Quality assessment of studies were assessed based on CONSORT-AI and QUADAS-2. Outcomes extracted included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC).\r\nResults: Out of 69 studies screened, five studies with different study designs, dataset sizes, and type of DL algorithms employed were included in the systematic review. Most studies employed DL to analyze slit-lamp images to diagnose CC, while one study utilized DL to predict existence of CC from several risk factors. In silico, most studies demonstrated high accuracy and validity of DL algorithms in detecting and predicting CC; however, DL algorithm is not as accurate in diagnosing CC when compared to human counterparts. These studies had limited generalizability given the homogenous population.\r\nConclusion: DL shows potential as an adjunct tool for ophthalmologists to improve diagnosis and, therefore, treatment decisions for CC, particularly in remote and underdeveloped regions with limited medical resources.",

These techniques of human-computer interaction range from primary keyboard inputs to complex vision-based gesture detection systems. One of the fascinating HCI technologies is hand gesture recognition. The goal of gesture recognition is to construct a system to use as a communication medium in various applications. The application of gesture recognition has become popular in healthcare, robotics, etc. Posture recognition is deployed in several sectors, including medicine. Deep learning-based models are used to understand gesture and posture recognition results better. This chapter covers the challenges of gesture and posture recognition and how deep learning techniques are used to assist machines in overcoming these challenges more effectively. In addition, this chapter also discusses the applications in which gesture and posture recognition can be employed in detail.",

        "abstract": "A bridge inspection needs a lot of costs. It causes a lack of engineers and budget. So, some local governments couldn’t complete the bridge’s aggressive preventive maintenance in Japan. Recently, deep learning-based damage detection methods have been studied by many researchers to reduce the cost of the bridge’s aggressive preventive maintenance. This kind of method could detect the damage to the bridge by photo image with a detection model which has been trained with a large training dataset. In contrast to the increase in dataset size, the effectiveness of the quality of training data is not discussed enough. In this paper, the ratio of negative samples in the training data is regarded as the quality of training data. In this study, we targeted the automatic detection process of the rebar exposure and the peeling on the surface of bridges. The effects of the ratio of the negative example data in a training dataset have been evaluated. In this study, the negative sample means the annotated data with no target damage. The negative sample image is the part of a bridge but does not include target damages. Many previous studies generate this kind of image when generating annotation data from real bridge photo images, but do not utilize it. A three-fold cross-validation method has been adopted to keep the robustness of the detection. The seven different detection models have trained with seven different training dataset which has different negative sample ratios. As a result of comparing the detection results of each model, the influence of the negative example data on the training data was confirmed. There was a peak of the recall curve in the middle of increasing the negative sample ratios. The correct negative sample ratio could improve the accuracy of damage detection.",

A successful instructional approach includes ideological and political content within the context of cultural training. Students would do well to observe the facial expressions used by their lecturers in class to completely appreciate the themes being discussed and the strategies being used. A group of high school seniors from a Shanghai high school will take part in experimental research to determine the model's viability. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of education in the classroom is to conduct a poll with students and instructors to get a sense of their thoughts on the topic. More than half of the student body prefers competitions and lectures to other sorts of intellectual and political involvement in the classroom. This model's expression recognition accuracy is more than 2.9% greater than that of other models, and the model's improvement effect is incredible. The authors also investigated the influence of including experimentation in the quality evaluation process.",

        "abstract": "Plant leaf recognition has been carried out widely using low-level features. Scale invariant feature transform technique has been used to extract the low-level features. Leaves that match based on low-level features but do not do so in semantic perspective cannot be recognized. To address this, global features are extracted and used. Similarly, convolutional neural networks, deep learning networks, and transfer learning-based neural networks have been used for leaf image recognition. Even then there are issues like leaf images in various illuminations, rotations, taken in different angle, and so on. To address such issues, the closeness among low-level features and global features are computed using multiple distance measures, and a leaf recognition framework has been proposed. Two deep network models, namely Densenet and Xception, are used in the experiments. The matched patches are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. Experimental results obtained are promising for the closeness-based leaf recognition framework as well as the Densenet-based leaf recognition.",

Multiple methods of detection have been proposed so far for diagnosing MS; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has drawn a lot of interest from healthcare providers. The ability to quickly diagnose lesions related to MS depends on a fundamental understanding of the anatomy and workings of the brain that MRI technology provides doctors.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMotivation: The definition of the genome distribution of the Myc transcription factor is extremely important since it may help predict its transcriptional activity particularly in the context of cancer. Myc is among the most powerful oncogenes involved in the occurrence and development of more than 80% of different types of pediatric and adult cancers. Myc regulates thousands of genes which can be in part different, depending on the type of tissues and tumours. Myc distribution along the genome has been determined experimentally through chromatin immunoprecipitation This approach, although powerful, is very time consuming and cannot be routinely applied to tumours of individual patients. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to develop in-silico tools that can effectively and rapidly predict its distribution on a given cell genome. New advanced computational tools (DeeperBind) can then be successfully employed to determine the function of Myc in a specific tumour, and may help to devise new directions and approaches to experiments first and personalized and more effective therapeutic treatments for a single patient later on. Results: The use of DeeperBind with DeepRAM on Colab platform can effectively predict the binding sites for the MYC factor with an accuracy above 0.96 AUC, when trained with multiple cell lines. The analysis of the filters in DeeperBind trained models shows, besides the consensus sequence CACGTG classically associated to the MYC factor, also the other consensus sequences G/C box or TGGGA, respectively bound by the SP1 and MIZ-1 transcription factors, which are known to mediate the MYC repressive response. Overall, our findings suggest a stronger sinergy between the machine learning tools as DeeperBind and biological experiments, which may reduce the time consuming experiments by providing a direction to guide them.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomatic modulation classification (AMC) plays an increasingly vital role in cognitive radio (CR), cognitive electronic warfare, and other areas. It aims at classifying the modulated modes of the received signals accurately and provides a guarantee for the subsequent detailed parameter identification. Deep learning (DL) methods allow the computer to automatically learn the pattern features and integrate features into the process of building the model, thereby reducing the incompleteness caused by artificial design features. At the same time, the DL methods have been applied in the AMC field as its powerful ability to process complex data and have achieved excellent performance in recent years. In this paper, we propose a deep ensemble learning AMC network, which uses a multi-model ensemble method to fuse multiple DL features. Specifically, different DL models are integrated by ensemble learning, which enhances the learning ability of the single model. With the proposed ensemble model trained on a measured wireless signal dataset, we conclude that the ensemble structure of Inception and CLDNN can fuse spatial features and temporal features, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in AMC tasks. Besides, the impact of the inphase/quadrature (I/Q) sample-length on wireless signals is further investigated, and find that the classification accuracy of the deep ensemble model is improved by 0.7% to 10% compared to the single model under various sample-length. Simultaneously, we visualize convergence clustering with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and the visualization results prove that the deep ensemble model has a stronger clustering ability than a single model.",

In this study, we propose AgentNet, a model-free data-driven framework consisting of deep neural networks to reveal and analyze the hidden interactions in complex systems from observed data alone. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network with novel variable-wise attention to model the interaction between individual agents, and employs various encoders and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model successfully captured a wide variety of simulated complex systems, namely cellular automata (discrete), the Vicsek model (continuous), and active Ornstein--Uhlenbeck particles (non-Markovian) in which, notably, AgentNet's visualized attention values coincided with the true variable-wise interaction strengths and exhibited collective behavior that was absent in the training data. A demonstration with empirical data from a flock of birds showed that AgentNet could identify hidden interaction ranges exhibited by real birds, which cannot be detected by conventional velocity correlation analysis. We expect our framework to open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into general process-driven modeling.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has been increasingly used in various applications such as image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain–computer interfaces, and financial time series. In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. Multilayer perceptrons usually mean fully connected networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. The full connectivity of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. Typical ways of regularization, or preventing overfitting, include penalizing parameters during training or trimming connectivity. CNNs use relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. Given the rise in popularity and use of deep neural network learning, the problem of tuning hyperparameters is increasingly prominent tasks in constructing efficient deep neural networks. In this paper, the tuning of deep neural network learning (DNN) hyper-parameters is explored using an evolutionary based approach popularized for use in estimating solutions to problems where the problem space is too large to get an exact solution.",

        "abstract": "Greenhouse (GHG) gases are the primary driver of climate change. There are two approaches to measuring GHG emissions: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up measurement involves collecting data based on local emissions and modeling individual sources and sinks of carbon. This is useful for understanding the specific drivers of GHG emissions; however, there is a time lag for collecting data from each source, and good national statistics are required. Meanwhile, top-down measurement involves estimating GHG emissions based on atmospheric measurements and modeling. In general, the bottom-up approach is considered to be more accurate than the top-down approach, but the top-down approach is helpful for providing broad-scale estimates of GHG emissions, and it allows for spatial mapping on a global scale.In this study, we use OCO-2 satellite products to generate a XCO2 global map using a deep-learning-based technique. Although OCO-2 measurement provides the CO2 concentrations with the highest spatial resolution on a global scale, there are limitations to the FOV coverage and the low temporal resolution of the low-earth orbit satellite. To solve this problem, we use additional satellite products, which can be a precursor to CO2, and we applied TabNet which is firstly introduced at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2020. TabNet is an attention-based network that uses a self-attention mechanism. The preliminary results showed that the XCO2 global map for every half of the month could be provided using integrated satellite observations. The validation results will be discussed in the presentation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT3’-end cleavage and polyadenylation is an essential process for eukaryotic mRNA maturation. In yeast species, the polyadenylation signals that recruit the processing machinery are degenerate and remain poorly characterized compared to well-defined regulatory elements in mammals. Especially, recent deep sequencing experiments showed extensive cleavage heterogeneity for some mRNAs inSaccharomyces cerevisiaeand uncovered the polyA motif differences betweenS. cerevisiaevs.Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The findings raised the fundamental question of how polyadenylation signals are formed in yeast. Here we addressed this question by developing deep learning models to deconvolute degeneratecis-regulatory elements and quantify their positional importance in mediating yeast polyA site formation, cleavage heterogeneity, and strength. InS. cerevisiae, cleavage heterogeneity is promoted by the depletion of U-rich elements around polyA sites as well as multiple occurrences of upstream UA-rich elements. Sites with high cleavage heterogeneity show overall lower strength. The site strength and tandem site distances modulate alternative polyadenylation (APA) under the diauxic stress.

        "abstract": "Chest X-rays have been found to be very promising for assessing COVID-19 patients, especially for resolving emergency-department and urgent-care-center overcapacity.  Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the disease using chest X-rays. While many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, this study aimed to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases. In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve.  AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.",

Recent findings show that inter-residue distance prediction, a more granular version of the well-known contact prediction problem, is a key to predict accurate models. We believe that deep learning methods that predict these distances are still at infancy. To advance these methods and develop other novel methods, we need a small and representative dataset packaged for fast development and testing. In this work, we introduce Protein Distance Net (PDNET), a dataset derived from the widely used DeepCov dataset and consists of 3456 representative protein chains for training and validation. It is packaged with all the scripts that were used to curate the dataset, generate the input features and distance maps, and scripts with deep learning models to train, validate and test. Deep learning models can also be trained and tested in a web browser using free platforms such as Google Colab. We discuss how this dataset can be used to predict contacts, distance intervals, and real-valued distances (in Å) by designing regression models.

Deep learning is a growing trend in the edge of technology and its applications are now seen in many aspects of our life such as object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Currently, almost all major sciences and technologies are benefiting from the advantages of deep learning such as high accuracy, speed and flexibility. Therefore, any efforts in improving performance of related techniques is valuable. Deep learning accelerators are considered as hardware architecture, which are designed and optimized for increasing speed, efficiency and accuracy of computers that are running deep learning algorithms. In this paper, after reviewing some backgrounds on deep learning, a well-known accelerator architecture named MAERI (Multiply-Accumulate Engine with Reconfigurable interconnects) is investigated. Performance of a deep learning task is measured and compared in two different data flow strategies: NLR (No Local Reuse) and NVDLA (NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator), using an open source tool called MAESTRO (Modeling Accelerator Efficiency via Spatio-Temporal Resource Occupancy). Measured performance indicators of novel optimized architecture, NVDLA shows higher L1 and L2 computation reuse, and lower total runtime (cycles) in comparison to the other one. ",

Research regarding automatic corrosion detection is ongoing, with recent progress leveraging advances in deep learning. Research is hindered by the lack of a publicly available dataset; thus, models use locally produced datasets suitable for the immediate conditions, but unable to produce generalized models for corrosion detection. These algorithms will output a considerable number of false positives and false negatives when challenged in the field. In this paper, we present SpotRust, a deep learning-based corrosion detector that performs pixel-level segmentation of corrosion. Moreover, three Bayesian variants of SpotRust are presented that provide uncertainty estimates depicting the confidence levels at each pixel, to better inform decision makers. Experiments are performed on a newly collected dataset consisting of 280 images, we validate our algorithms are accurate and reliable. Code is provided at https://github.com/StuvX/SpotRust.",

The training state reported here does not yet rival the performance of existing traditional approaches, but we present evidence that our method will reach a comparable detection power with sufficient training time. Training success of DECIMER depends on the input data representation: DeepSMILES are clearly superior over SMILES and we have preliminary indication that the recently reported SELFIES outperform DeepSMILES. An extrapolation of our results towards larger training data sizes suggest that we might be able to achieve >90% accuracy with about 60 to 100 million training structures, so that training can be completed within several months on a single GPU.

Metric learning methods, which generally use a linear projection, are limited in solving real-world problems demonstrating non-linear characteristics. Kernel approaches are utilized in metric learning to address this problem. In recent years, deep metric learning, which provides a better solution for nonlinear data through activation functions, has attracted researchers' attention in many different areas. This article aims to reveal the importance of deep metric learning and the problems dealt with in this field in the light of recent studies. As far as the research conducted in this field are concerned, most existing studies that are inspired by Siamese and Triplet networks are commonly used to correlate among samples while using shared weights in deep metric learning. The success of these networks is based on their capacity to understand the similarity relationship among samples. Moreover, sampling strategy, appropriate distance metric, and the structure of the network are the challenging factors for researchers to improve the performance of the network model. This article is considered to be important, as it is the first comprehensive study in which these factors are systematically analyzed and evaluated as a whole and supported by comparing the quantitative results of the methods.",

Shared images include tobacco products and can be encouraging for young people and children when they are accessible.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn this study, it is aimed to detect tobacco and tobacco products with various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 1607 public images were collected from Instagram, and feature vectors were extracted with various CNNs, which proved to be successful in the competitions and CNN was determined to be proper for this problem.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMobileNet gave the highest results 99.1% as weighted average. The feature vector of the input images are extracted with CNNs and classified with the latest fully connected layer.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe classification of the tobacco products of 4 different classes was studied by using the networks and the classification performance rate was obtained as 100% for 322 test images via MobileNet. In this way, the content that is encouraging for children can be censored or filtered with a high accuracy rate and a secure Internet environment can be provided.\n",

        "abstract": "Scalable electronic predictions are critical for soft materials design. Recently, the Electronic Coarse-Graining (ECG) method was introduced to renormalize all-atom quantum chemical (QC) predictions to coarse-grained (CG) molecular representations using deep neural networks (DNN). While DNN can learn complex representations that prove challenging for traditional kernel-based methods, they are susceptible to overfitting and the overconfidence of uncertainty estimations. Here, we develop ECG within the GPU-accelerated Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) framework to enable CG QC predictions of a conjugated oligomer using range-separated hybrid density functional theory. DKL-ECG provides accurate reproduction of QC electronic properties in conjunction with prediction uncertainties that facilitate efficient training over multiple temperature data sets via active learning. We show that while active learning algorithms enable efficient sampling of a more diverse configurational space relative to random sampling, the predictive accuracy of DKL-ECG models is effectively identical across all active learning methodologies employed. We attribute this result to the low conformational barriers of our test molecule and the redundant sampling of configurations induced by Boltzmann sampling, even for distinct temperature ensembles.",

In this difficult period, various research projects are taking place to study and analyse the dynamics of the pandemic. In the present work, we firstly present a deep overview of the main forecasting models to predict the new cases of COVID-19. In this context, we focus on univariate time series models in order to analyze the dynamic change of this pandemic through time. We secondly shed light on multivariate time series forecasting models using weather and daily tests data, to study the impact of exogenous features on the progression of COVID-19. In the final stage of this paper, we present our proposed approach based on LSTM and GRU ensemble learning model and evaluate the results using the MAE, RMSE and MAPE for the prediction of new cases. The results of our experiments using the Canadian dataset show that the ensemble model performs well in comparison to other models. In addition, this research provides us with a new outcome regarding the dynamic correlation between temperature, humidity and daily test data and its impact on the new contaminated cases.",

        "abstract": "Interactive Annotation for object delineation can be considered as a semi-supervised few-shot learning problem where machine learning models learn from a small set of annotated pixels and generalize to the entire picture to extract the object of interest. One aim of interactive annotation is to reduce the effort of manually labeling data. Some existing works attempted to address this problem with deep metric learning so that the encoding layers in the network are able to extract features that boost discriminability among pixels belonging to different classes. To keep the data structure in the embedding space, metric loss with prototypes has been proposed. In our work, we improved the existing methods by developing a new objective function to update the network and prototypes simultaneously. The prototypes are optimized based on the loss that enhances their dissimilarity instead of clustering or sampling from the dataset. Moreover, we designed a GUI with the proposed method for interdisciplinary collaboration of image-support plant phenotyping studies.",

Machine learning, deep learning and statistical analysis techniques are used here to get the accurate result so the investors can see the future trend and maximize the return of investment in stock trading. This paper will review many deep learning algorithms for stock price forecasting. We use a record of s&p 500 index data for training and testing. The survey motive is to check various deep learning and statistical model techniques for stock price forecasting that are Moving Averages, ARIMA which are statistical techniques and LSTM, RNN, CNN, and FULL CNN which are deep learning models. It will discuss various models, including the Auto regression integration moving average model, the Recurrent neural network model, the long short-term model which is the type of RNN used for long dependency for data, the convolutional neural network model, and the full convolutional neural network model, in terms of error calculation or percentage of accuracy that how much it is accurate which measures by the function like Root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean squared error. The model can be used to predict the stock price by checking the low MAE value as lower the MAE value the difference between the predicting and the actual value will be less and this model will predict the price more accurately than other models.",

Despite established analytical contributions with regard to explanation of food processors’ pricing policies in agricultural spatial markets, the need for models, which can reflect real complex market environment features is contemporary. Agent-based models ABMs serve by now as computational laboratories to help understand market outcomes emerging from autonomously interacting agents. Yet, individual agents within ABMs must be equipped with appropriate intelligent learning algorithms.

        "abstract": "<p>This paper proposes a demand response method that aims to reduce the long-term charging cost of a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) while overcoming obstacles such as the stochastic nature of the user’s driving be- haviour, traffic condition, energy usage, and energy price. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with unknown transition probabilities and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Existing methods using machine learning either requires initial user behaviour data, or converges far too slowly. This method does not require any initial data on the PEV owner’s driving behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed. A combination of both model-based and model-free learning called Dyna-Q algorithm is utilized. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated and the RL agent will learn from both real data set and “imagined” experience from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-look up method is impractical and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs. An average of historical price is used to predict future price. Three different user behaviour without any initial PEV owner behaviour data are simulated. A purely model-free DQN method is shown to run out of battery during trips very often, and is impractical for real life charging scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its ability to reach an optimal policy quicker while avoiding state of charge (SOC) depleting during trips when compared to existing PEV charging schemes for all three different users profiles.</p>",

However, setting up molecular scenes in these programs can be laborious even for expert users, and rendering often requires substantial time and computer resources.ResultsWe have created a deep-learning model called Prot2Prot that quickly imitates photorealistic visualization styles, given a much simpler, easy-to-generate molecular representation. The resulting images are often indistinguishable from images rendered using industry-standard 3D graphics programs, but they can be created in a fraction of the time, even when running in a web browser. To the best of our knowledge, Prot2Prot is the first example of image-to-image translation applied to macromolecular visualization.AvailabilityProt2Prot is available free of charge, released under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.

The training state reported here does not yet rival the performance of existing traditional approaches, but we present evidence that our method will reach a comparable detection power with sufficient training time. Training success of DECIMER depends on the input data representation: DeepSMILES are clearly superior over SMILES and we have preliminary indication that the recently reported SELFIES outperform DeepSMILES. An extrapolation of our results towards larger training data sizes suggest that we might be able to achieve >90% accuracy with about 60 to 100 million training structures, so that training can be completed within several months on a single GPU.

Computer vision plays a vital part in the field of human health, which helps to reduce the amount of human judgement that is required to produce accurate findings. Scans using computed tomography (CT), x-rays, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most popular imaging technologies used in MRI, and they could also the greatest trustworthy and safe. The MRI can identify even the most minute of objects. In this paper Alzheimer’s disease detection in early-stage, based on MRI by using the deep learning technique U-Net and Efficient net which is a Convolutional neural network is implemented. Diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease (AD) accurately is an vital aspect in treating AD patients, eventually during the early disease stages. This is particularly true in the early disease stages of the disease, when awareness of risk, enables AD patients to takeup protective measures well before the occurrence of brain damage that cannot be reversed. Despite of the fact that computers have been utilised in a significant number of recent research to diagnose AD, the majority of machine detection approaches are restricted by congenital findings. Early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be identified, but early-stage AD cannot be predicted because prediction of the disease is successful only before the (AD) disease reveals itself. Deep Learning, often known as DL, has recently emerged as a popular method for the initial recognition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this article, we will give a quick overview of some of the key research that has been done on AD, and we will investigate how DL can assist researchers in the early phases of disease diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n· Purpose: Mammograms are analyzed to identify and localize breast mass lesions as an aid to clinician review.\n· Approach: Two complementary forms of deep learning are used to identify the regions of interest (ROIs). An object-detection algorithm, YOLO v5, analyzes the entire mammogram to identify discrete image regions likely to represent masses. Object detections exhibit high precision. A convolutional neural network (CNN) also analyzes the mammogram after it has been decomposed into subregion tiles, and is trained to emphasize sensitivity (recall). The ROIs identified by each form of analysis are highlighted in different colors to facilitate an efficient staged review.\n· Results and conclusion: The object-detection stage alone exhibits high precision but insufficient overall accuracy for a clinical application. The CNN stage nearly always detects tumor masses when present, but typically occupies a larger area of the image. By inspecting the high-precision regions followed by the high-sensitivity regions, clinicians can quickly identify likely lesions before completing review of the full mammogram. Even without removing pectoral muscle from the analysis, the ROIs occupy less than 20% of the tissue in the mammograms on average. As a result, the proposed system helps clinicians review mammograms with greater accuracy and efficiency.",

Recently,  the  brother of Artificial Intelligence titled \"Artificial Satisfaction\" was introduced in literature [10]. In this article, we coin the term “Deep Loving”. After the publication of this article, \"Deep Loving\" will be considered  as  the  friend  of  Deep  Learning.  Proposing  a  new  field  is  different  from  proposing  a  new algorithm. In this paper, we strongly focus on defining and introducing \"Deep Loving Field\" to  Research  Scientists  across  the  globe.  The  future  of  the  \"Deep  Loving\"  field  is  predicted  by  showing  few  future  opportunities  in  this  new  field.  The  definition  of  Deep  Learning  is  shown  followed by a literature review of the \"Deep Loving\" field. The World's First Deep Loving Algorithm (WFDLA) is designed and implemented in this work by adding Deep Loving concepts to Particle Swarm  Optimization  Algorithm.  Results  obtained  by  WFDLA  are  compared  with  the  PSO  algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning opens up a plethora of opportunities for academia and industry to invent new techniques to come up with modified or enhanced versions of standardized neural networks so that the customized technique is suitable for any specialized situations where the problem is about learning a complex mapping from the input to the output space. One such situation lies in a farm with huge cultivation area, where examining each of the plant for any anomalies is highly complex that it is impractical, if not impossible, for humans. In this chapter, the authors propose an optimized deep learning architectural model, combining various techniques in neural networks for a real-world application of deep learning in computer vision in precision farming. More precisely, thousands of crops are examined automatically and classified as healthy or unhealthy. The highlight of this architecture is the strategic usage of spatial and temporal features selectively so as to reduce the inference time. ",

        "abstract": "In this article, it is aimed to classify healthy and four different plant diseases from Cassava plant leaf images. For this purpose, the “Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification” data set, which is an up-to-date and difficult data set published in 2020, was used. The used data set includes a total of 21,397 images consisting of healthy and four different diseases. In the study, in the MATLAB environment, the images were first subjected to the Chan-Vese (CV) Segmentation method and the area of interest was determined. Features were extracted with the ResNet 50 and MobileNetV2 deep learning architectures from the detected areas. Extracted features are classified by Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. \nThe images are divided into two as training and testing according to the K-fold 5 value. The average highest success rates in training and test data were achieved by using the ResNet50 architecture and SVM classifier together, as a result of segmentation. As a result of training and testing processes, 85.4% and 84.4% success rates were obtained, respectively. At the end of the test process of the study, a trained network was obtained according to ResNet50, where the highest success rates were obtained, and MobileNetV2, another deep learning architecture used in the study. It has been compiled with MATLAB Builder NE in order to run these two networks in the web environment. The methods obtained as a result of the compilation are integrated into the ASP.NET MVC5 programming language. Finally, it has been made available to manufacturers with a web-based embedded interface. Thus, a deep learning-based decision support system has been developed that can be easily used by all manufacturers in the web environment.",

To overcome the limitations of Microscopy that is operated by humans, the deep-learning-based methods of image analysis of these Microorganisms have been proposed for a variety of purposes, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Also, Deep-learning-based systems are expected to be at the forefront of detecting and investigating microorganisms. So, here we are proposing a deep learning model that can classify and detect the type of organism using a CNN-based transfer learning algorithm. A prediction of disease spread is also possible once an organism is detected. Through modernization, we came to know that micro-organisms were useful to plants and animals but at another side of the coin they are also harmful to them, so their study is vitally important but they haven’t gone to the next phase from testing under the microscope, so we proposed this model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMonte Carlo (MC) simulation is considered the gold standard method for radiotherapy dose calculation. However, achieving high precision requires a large number of simulation histories, which is time-consuming. The use of computer graphics processing units (GPUs) has greatly accelerated MC simulation and allows dose calculation within a few minutes for a typical radiotherapy treatment plan. However, some clinical applications demand real-time efficiency for MC dose calculation. To tackle this problem, we have developed a real-time, deep learning (DL)-based dose denoiser that can be plugged into a current GPU-based MC dose engine to enable real-time MC dose calculation. We used two different acceleration strategies to achieve this goal: (1) we applied voxel unshuffle and voxel shuffle operators to decrease the input and output sizes without any information loss, and (2) we decoupled the 3D volumetric convolution into a 2D axial convolution and a 1D slice convolution. In addition, we used a weakly supervised learning framework to train the network, which greatly reduces the size of the required training dataset and thus enables fast fine-tuning-based adaptation of the trained model to different radiation beams. Experimental results show that the proposed denoiser can run in as little as 39 ms, which is 11.6 times faster than the baseline model. As a result, the whole MC dose calculation pipeline can be finished within ∼ 0.15 s, including both GPU MC dose calculation and DL-based denoising, achieving the real-time efficiency needed for some radiotherapy applications, such as online adaptive radiotherapy.",

        "abstract": "Understanding individual differences in theory of mind (the ability to attribute mental states to others) in middle childhood and adolescence hinges on the availability of robust and scalable measures. Open-ended response tasks yield valid indicators of theory of mind but are labor intensive and difficult to compare across studies. We examined the reliability and validity of new machine learning and deep learning neural network automated scoring systems for measuring theory of mind in children and adolescents. Two large samples of British children and adolescents aged between 7 and 13 years (Sample 1: N = 1135, Mean Age = 10.22 years, SD = 1.45; Sample 2: N = 1020, Mean Age = 10.36 years, SD = 1.27) completed the Silent Film and Strange Stories tasks. Teachers rated Sample 2 children’s social competence with peers. A single latent-factor explained variation in performance on both the Silent Film and Strange Stories task (in Sample 1 and 2) and test performance was sensitive to age-related differences and individual differences within each age group. A deep learning neural network automated scoring system trained on Sample 1 exhibited inter-rater reliability and measurement invariance with manual ratings in Sample 2. Validity of ratings from the automated scoring system was supported by unique positive associations between theory of mind and teacher-rated social competence. The results demonstrate that reliable and valid measures of theory of mind can be obtained using the new freely available deep learning neural network automated scoring system to rate open-ended text responses.",

Three primary machine learning techniques are mainly investigated, including deep belief network, decision tree and support vector machine. We have presented a brief exploration to gauge the performance of these machine learning techniques in the spam detection, intrusion detection and malware detection starting from IP traffic classification, filtering malicious traffic for intrusion detection based on frequently used and benchmark datasets. Various attacks have been classified using the ML algorithms and finally the performance of each algorithm have been assessed. The complexity of ML/DM algorithms is addressed, discussion of challenges for using ML/DM for cyber security is presented, and some recommendations on when to use a given method are provided.",

However, several drawbacks can be identified for these systems: 1) The data efficiency is unclear given they appear to require far more training games to achieve such performance than any human player might experience in a lifetime. 2) These systems are not easily interpretable as they provide limited explanation about how decisions are made. 3) These systems do not provide transferability of the learned strategies to other games. We study in this work how an explicit logical representation can overcome these limitations and introduce a new logical system called MIGO designed for learning two player game optimal strategies. It benefits from a strong inductive bias which provides the capability to learn efficiently from a few examples of games played. Additionally, MIGO's learned rules are relatively easy to comprehend, and are demonstrated to achieve significant transfer learning.",

        "abstract": "\n_\nThis article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper URTeC 2021-5688, “Physics-Assisted Transfer Learning for Production Prediction in Unconventional Reservoirs,” by J. Cornelio, SPE, S. Mohd Razak, SPE, and A. Jahandideh, University of Southern California, et al. The paper has not been peer reviewed.\n\n\n_\nA physics-assisted deep-learning model is presented to facilitate transfer learning in unconventional reservoirs by integrating the complementary strengths of physics-based and data-driven predictive models. The developed model uses a deep-learning architecture to map formation properties to their corresponding production responses using a low-dimensional feature space representation. The results indicate that physics-based simulated data can facilitate production predictions when out-of-range (unseen) input parameters have to extrapolate from data and that transferring the weights learned from the source field to the target field can add valuable information to enhance the prediction performance of the target field.\n\n\nIntroduction\nWhile the limitations of simulation models make them unreliable for developing unconventional reservoirs, the increasing number of wells drilled in recent decades has provided an extensive database for tight oil horizontal wells. The use of such large data sets has permitted the use of data-driven proxy models. These models rely on estimating the approximate functional input/output relations by using various statistical and mathematical techniques. Neural networks are one such type of model designed to emulate neurons in the brain to find patterns within data that have complex relations. Implementation of data-driven proxy models has been used in the characterization of both unconventional and conventional reservoirs. However, these models cannot extrapolate data outside the training-data range.\nTransfer learning is one way in which a data-driven model trained on a large data set can be used to learn relevant and common features to solve a specific task with a given source data set. These features are then transferred to build a different model for a target data set with a similar problem definition. The method proposed by the authors attempts to take the benefits of both physics-based simulators and data-driven proxy models to build a more-robust model that can be transferred to build a reliable proxy model for a new field with limited data.\nIn the model presented in the complete paper, all discrepancies between the simulated responses and field production data can be compensated. Then, the model is transferred to a second neural network designed to be a proxy model for the target field with much smaller data. The neural-network model will attempt to capture the correlations between its formation properties and the difference in production responses from this field. The equations vital to this process are provided in the complete paper.\n",

        "abstract": "There are believed to be ~20,000 nebulae in the Milky Way Galaxy. However, humans have only cataloged ~1,800 of them even though we have gathered 1.3 million nebula images. Resources like the Hubble telescope can automatically explore space, discover new artifacts, and capture new images. Still, their classification is a human skill, which ultimately is interminable and subject to human error. Classification is important as it helps scientists understand the chemical composition of a nebula which in turn helps them understand the material of the original star. Our research on nebulae classification aims to make the process of classifying new nebulae faster and more accurate using a hybrid of deep learning and machine learning techniques. Our hypothesis is that the application of machine learning and deep learning methodologies effectively classifies nebulae based on images. Using a dataset primarily of images from the European Space Agency, we experimented with a range of artificial intelligence techniques such as featurization and color conversion and then determined the deep learning network/machine learning algorithms that produced the best results. The main conclusions reached from our research were that (a) the artificial intelligence (AI) was not dependent on color to classify nebulae, (b) dropping specific categories increased accuracy, and (c) featurization is the most effective technique to classify nebulae accurately. Automated classification of nebulae will help us discover, identify, and classify these marvels much faster and more accurately to expand our understanding of nebulae.",

However, if the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model is tested on our own data, the accuracy drops to 26%, which demonstrates the superiority of our algorithm, which performs at 63% on the MotionSense data used to train the dimension-adaptive neural architecture model.\n\n\nConclusions\nHumanActivityRecorder is a versatile, retrainable, open-source, and accurate toolbox that is continually tested on new data. This enables researchers to adapt to the behavior being measured and achieve repeatability in scientific studies.\n",

It has attracted increasing attention how to improve the quality of sleep and reduce the impact of sleep related diseases on health. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals collected during sleep belong to spontaneous EEG signals. Spontaneous sleep EEG signals can reflect the body own changes, which is also an important basis for diagnosis and treatment of related diseases. Therefore, the establishment of an effective model for classifying sleep EEG signals is an important auxiliary tool for evaluating sleep.",

        "abstract": "In the near future, value streams associated with Industry 4.0 will be formed by interconnected cyber–physical elements forming complex networks that generate huge amounts of data in real time. The success or failure of industry leaders interested in the continuous improvement of lean management systems in this context is determined by their ability to recognize behavioral patterns in these big data structured within non-Euclidean domains, such as these dynamic sociotechnical complex networks. We assume that artificial intelligence in general and deep learning in particular may be able to help find useful patterns of behavior in 4.0 industrial environments in the lean management of cyber–physical systems. However, although these technologies have meant a paradigm shift in the resolution of complex problems in the past, the traditional methods of deep learning, focused on image or video analysis, both with regular structures, are not able to help in this specific field. This is why this work focuses on proposing geometric deep lean learning, a mathematical methodology that describes deep-lean-learning operations such as convolution and pooling on cyber–physical Industry 4.0 graphs. Geometric deep lean learning is expected to positively support sustainable organizational growth because customers and suppliers ought to be able to reach new levels of transparency and traceability on the quality and efficiency of processes that generate new business for both, hence generating new products, services, and cooperation opportunities in a cyber–physical environment.",

Since current approaches for diagnosis of lymph node metastases are time-consuming, deep learning (DL) algorithms with more speed and accuracy are explored for effective alternatives.\nMethods: A total of 220025 whole-slide pictures from patients’ lymph nodes were classified into two cohorts: testing and training. For metastatic cancer identification, we employed hybrid convolutional network models. The performance of our diagnostic system was verified using 57458 unlabeled images that utilized criteria that included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and P-value.\nResults: The DL-based system that was automatically and exclusively capable of quantifying and identifying metastatic lymph nodes was engineered. Quantification was made with 98.84% accuracy. Moreover, the precision of VGG16 and Recall was 92.42% and 91.25%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrated that metastatic cancer differentiation levels could influence the recognition performance.\nConclusion: Our engineered diagnostic complex showed an elevated level of precision and efficiency for lymph node diagnosis. Our innovative DL-based system has a potential to simplify pathological screening for metastasis in breast cancer patients.",

Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the disease using chest X-rays. While many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, this study aimed to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases. In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve.  AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.",

Fortunately, we have abundant observational data of both the solar disk and solar wind, which are ameable to the application of data-hungry neural networks to the forecasting problem. To date, almost all neural networks trained for geomagnetic storm forecasting have utilized solar wind observations from the Earth-Sun first Lagrangian point (L1) or closer and have generated deterministic output without uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, existing models generate forecasts for indices that are also sensitive to induced internal magnetic fields, complicating the forecasting problem with another layer of non-linearity. In this work, we present neural networks trained on observations from both the solar disk and the L1 point. Our architecture generates reliable probabilistic forecasts over Est, the external component of the disturbance storm time index, showing that neural networks can learn measures of confidence in their output.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley and Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.",

The paper presents a comprehensive framework that combines deep reinforcement learning principles with NFV’s resource allocation problem. By leveraging this approach, intelligent and adaptive resource allocation strategies are developed, enhancing NFV performance, reducing operational costs, and optimizing resource utilization. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the paper evaluates the proposed framework’s effectiveness, comparing it with existing methods and showcasing its potential to transform NFV resource management.",

        "abstract": "Scalable electronic predictions are critical for soft materials design. Recently, the Electronic Coarse-Graining (ECG) method was introduced to renormalize all-atom quantum chemical (QC) predictions to coarse-grained (CG) molecular representations using deep neural networks (DNN). While DNN can learn complex representations that prove challenging for traditional kernel-based methods, they are susceptible to overfitting and the overconfidence of uncertainty estimations. Here, we develop ECG within the GPU-accelerated Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) framework to enable CG QC predictions of a conjugated oligomer using range-separated hybrid density functional theory. DKL-ECG provides accurate reproduction of QC electronic properties in conjunction with prediction uncertainties that facilitate efficient training over multiple temperature data sets via active learning. We show that while active learning algorithms enable efficient sampling of a more diverse configurational space relative to random sampling, the predictive accuracy of DKL-ECG models is effectively identical across all active learning methodologies employed. We attribute this result to the low conformational barriers of our test molecule and the redundant sampling of configurations induced by Boltzmann sampling, even for distinct temperature ensembles.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained from high-order ice flow model realizations have proven to be outstanding emulators in terms of fidelity and computational performance. However, the dependence on an ensemble of realizations of an instructor model renders this strategy difficult to generalize to a variety of ice flow regimes found in the nature. To overcome this issue, we adopt the approach of physics-informed deep learning, which fuses traditional numerical solutions by finite differences/elements and deep learning approaches. Here, we train a CNN to minimise the energy associated with high-order ice flow equations within the time iterations of a glacier evolution model. As a result, our emulator is a promising alternative to traditional solvers thanks to its high computational efficiency (especially on GPU), its high fidelity to the original model, its simplified training (without requiring any data), its capability to handle a variety of ice flow regimes and memorize previous solutions, and its relative simple implementation. Embedded into the ``Instructed Glacier Model’’ (IGM) framework, the potential of the emulator is illustrated with three applications including a large-scale high-resolution (2400x4000) forward glacier evolution model, an inverse modelling case for data assimilation, and an ice shelf.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In this study, we address point-forecasting using a deep learning LSTM-approach for renewable energy systems with focus on the short- to medium-range. Hourly resolution (medium-range) as well as 10-minute resolution (nowcasting) are the anticipated forecasting frequency. The forecasting approach is applied to: (i) wind speed at 10 meters height (observation sites), (ii) wind speed at hub-height of wind turbines, and (iii) solar power forecasts for selected solar power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As input to the proposed method numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, gridded observations (analysis and/or reanalysis), and point data are used. The data of studied test-cases is extracted from the Austrian TAWES system (Teilautomatische Wetterstationen, meteorological observations in 10-minute intervals), &amp;#160;SCADA data of wind farms, solar power output of a solar power plant, INCA's (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis) gridded observation fields, reanalysis fields from Merra2 and Era5-land, as well as, NWP data from the ECMWF IFS (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast&amp;#8217;s Integrated Forecasting System). These data-sources embrace very different temporal and spatial semantics, thus, careful pre-processing was carried out. Four daily runs over the course of one year for 12 synoptic sites + 38 wind turbines + 1 solar power plant test locations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of an LSTM architecture is that it includes recurrent steps in the ANN and, thus, is useful especially for time-series, such as meteorological observations or NWP forecasts. So far, comparatively few attempts have been made to integrate time-series with different semantics of a sensor network and physical models in one LSTM. We tackle this issue by conserving the time-steps of the delayed NWP along with their difference to recently observed time-series and, additionally, separate them into forecasting-intervals (e.g., of 3 to 12 subsequent forecasting hours being shortest in nowcasting). This enables us to employ a sequence-to-sequence LSTM based artificial neural network (ANN). The benefit of a sequence-to-sequence setup is to match an input- and output time-series in each sample, thereby, learning complex temporal relationships. To fully use the advantage of the diverse data a tailored pre- and post-processing of these heterogenous data sources in the renewable energy applications is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANN&amp;#8217;s results yield, in general, high forecast-skills, indicating a successful learning based on the used training data. Different combinations of inputs and processing-steps were investigated. It is shown that combining various data sources and implement an adequate pre- and post-processing yields the most promising results in the case studies (e.g.: a heuristic to estimate produced power based on the meteorological parameters and prediction of the offset to NWPs tailored to the studied location). Results are compared to traditional forecast methods and statistical methods such as a random forest and multiple-linear-regression.&lt;/p&gt;",

A relationship between a noisy character image to its clean counter-part are mapped using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.The overall process is divided into two stages: noise type classification and image denoising. Firstly, the noise type classification identifies the types of noise, and based on this noise type, a particular denoising model is selected, which increases the image denoising performance. The denoising network inputs a noisy image and a target of its clean corresponding image during the training. After the mapping function is trained, the generated model performs character image denoising. Then, on each band, a trained mapping function perform image denoising irrespective of the other band. Finally, each block is assembled to generate a clean image. In this paper, the MNIST and Char74K dataset of handwritten digits diluted with artificial noise divided into ten types are used for experimentation.. Our experimental results show that the proposed techniques perform better image denoising ascompared to the existing methods, both in terms of image noise type classification and image denoising. The overall Character recognition accuracy increased by 66% after performing the proposed denoising technique.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations have spread rapidly worldwide performing a variety of military and civilian applications. The ability and performance of UAS to carry out these applications are strongly affected by poor weather conditions. Fog is one of the critical issues that threaten the safety of UAS missions by altering visibility. Therefore, the mission planning based on accurate visibility nowcasts prior to Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) UAS missions will be mandatory to ensure safer UAS operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two types of models are generally considered for visibility nowcasting: physics-based or data-driven models. However, physics-based visibility forecasts remain expensive and difficult to use operationally. Recently, with the increase of the number of available historical data, data-driven models, especially those using deep learning approaches in particular, have attracted increasing attention in weather forecasting and have proven themselves as a powerful prediction tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims at developing a Visibility Nowcasting System (VNS) that improves the performance and the capability of nowcasting the visibility using deep learning over the U.S.. To that end, &amp;#160;a deep neural network, called an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN), is used to demonstrate specifically how basic NWP fields such as temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, etc. and visibility from surface observations can provide accurate visibility nowcasts. The VNS will be then tested in different geographical environments where UAS flights are deployed (for example, over North Dakota) since it can learn the time and space correlation according to the historical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the network, we created a labeled data set from available METAR reports and hourly reanalysis data from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model. This dataset will be also used to test the CNN and evaluate their nowcasting performance. The model will be then evaluated in operational use cases and compared to other available visibility observations during fog events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative multi-relay transmission scheme for mobile terminals to exploit spatial diversity. By improving the timeliness of measured channel state information (CSI) through deep learning (DL)-based channel prediction, the proposed scheme remarkably lowers the probability of wrong relay selection arising from outdated CSI in fast time-varying channels. It inherits the simplicity of opportunistic relaying by selecting a single relay, avoiding the complexity of multi-relay coordination and synchronization. Numerical results reveal that it can achieve full diversity gain in slow-fading channels and substantially outperforms the existing schemes in fast-fading wireless environments. Moreover, the computational complexity brought by the DL predictor is negligible compared to off-the-shelf computing hardware.",

The bit error rates (BERs) of these DL methods are compared with the conventional linear minimum mean squared error  (LMMSE) detector. Additionally, the relationships between the BER and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of interfering users (NoI) and modulation type are investigated. Numerical results show that all DL methods outperform LMMSE under different multiuser interference conditions, and FCDNN and LSTM give the best and robust anti-multiuser performance.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTNeural networks are important building blocks in technical applications. These artificial neural networks (ANNs) rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. A promising approach towards bridging this gap are the Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models that perform inference on their inputs. What is still missing are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers.Here, a learning rule for hierarchically organized SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits (MNIST) is presented. When applied together with an optimizer this learning method achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision that with this learning rule SBS networks will provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.",

        "abstract": "Chest X-rays have been found to be very promising for assessing COVID-19 patients, especially for resolving emergency-department and urgent-care-center overcapacity.  Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the detection of the disease using chest X-rays. While many new DL models have been being developed for this purpose, this study aimed to investigate the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases. In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve.  AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.",

Fortunately, we have abundant observational data of both the solar disk and solar wind, which are ameable to the application of data-hungry neural networks to the forecasting problem. To date, almost all neural networks trained for geomagnetic storm forecasting have utilized solar wind observations from the Earth-Sun first Lagrangian point (L1) or closer and have generated deterministic output without uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, existing models generate forecasts for indices that are also sensitive to induced internal magnetic fields, complicating the forecasting problem with another layer of non-linearity. In this work, we present neural networks trained on observations from both the solar disk and the L1 point. Our architecture generates reliable probabilistic forecasts over Est, the external component of the disturbance storm time index, showing that neural networks can learn measures of confidence in their output.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe vector autoregressive (VAR) model has been used to describe the dependence within and across multiple time series. This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley and Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.",

The paper presents a comprehensive framework that combines deep reinforcement learning principles with NFV’s resource allocation problem. By leveraging this approach, intelligent and adaptive resource allocation strategies are developed, enhancing NFV performance, reducing operational costs, and optimizing resource utilization.

Recently, the Electronic Coarse-Graining (ECG) method was introduced to renormalize all-atom quantum chemical (QC) predictions to coarse-grained (CG) molecular representations using deep neural networks (DNN). While DNN can learn complex representations that prove challenging for traditional kernel-based methods, they are susceptible to overfitting and the overconfidence of uncertainty estimations. Here, we develop ECG within the GPU-accelerated Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) framework to enable CG QC predictions of a conjugated oligomer using range-separated hybrid density functional theory. DKL-ECG provides accurate reproduction of QC electronic properties in conjunction with prediction uncertainties that facilitate efficient training over multiple temperature data sets via active learning. We show that while active learning algorithms enable efficient sampling of a more diverse configurational space relative to random sampling, the predictive accuracy of DKL-ECG models is effectively identical across all active learning methodologies employed. We attribute this result to the low conformational barriers of our test molecule and the redundant sampling of configurations induced by Boltzmann sampling, even for distinct temperature ensembles.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained from high-order ice flow model realizations have proven to be outstanding emulators in terms of fidelity and computational performance. However, the dependence on an ensemble of realizations of an instructor model renders this strategy difficult to generalize to a variety of ice flow regimes found in the nature. To overcome this issue, we adopt the approach of physics-informed deep learning, which fuses traditional numerical solutions by finite differences/elements and deep learning approaches. Here, we train a CNN to minimise the energy associated with high-order ice flow equations within the time iterations of a glacier evolution model. As a result, our emulator is a promising alternative to traditional solvers thanks to its high computational efficiency (especially on GPU), its high fidelity to the original model, its simplified training (without requiring any data), its capability to handle a variety of ice flow regimes and memorize previous solutions, and its relative simple implementation. Embedded into the ``Instructed Glacier Model’’ (IGM) framework, the potential of the emulator is illustrated with three applications including a large-scale high-resolution (2400x4000) forward glacier evolution model, an inverse modelling case for data assimilation, and an ice shelf.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In this study, we address point-forecasting using a deep learning LSTM-approach for renewable energy systems with focus on the short- to medium-range. Hourly resolution (medium-range) as well as 10-minute resolution (nowcasting) are the anticipated forecasting frequency. The forecasting approach is applied to: (i) wind speed at 10 meters height (observation sites), (ii) wind speed at hub-height of wind turbines, and (iii) solar power forecasts for selected solar power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As input to the proposed method numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, gridded observations (analysis and/or reanalysis), and point data are used. The data of studied test-cases is extracted from the Austrian TAWES system (Teilautomatische Wetterstationen, meteorological observations in 10-minute intervals), &amp;#160;SCADA data of wind farms, solar power output of a solar power plant, INCA's (Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis) gridded observation fields, reanalysis fields from Merra2 and Era5-land, as well as, NWP data from the ECMWF IFS (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast&amp;#8217;s Integrated Forecasting System). These data-sources embrace very different temporal and spatial semantics, thus, careful pre-processing was carried out. Four daily runs over the course of one year for 12 synoptic sites + 38 wind turbines + 1 solar power plant test locations are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of an LSTM architecture is that it includes recurrent steps in the ANN and, thus, is useful especially for time-series, such as meteorological observations or NWP forecasts. So far, comparatively few attempts have been made to integrate time-series with different semantics of a sensor network and physical models in one LSTM. We tackle this issue by conserving the time-steps of the delayed NWP along with their difference to recently observed time-series and, additionally, separate them into forecasting-intervals (e.g., of 3 to 12 subsequent forecasting hours being shortest in nowcasting). This enables us to employ a sequence-to-sequence LSTM based artificial neural network (ANN). The benefit of a sequence-to-sequence setup is to match an input- and output time-series in each sample, thereby, learning complex temporal relationships. To fully use the advantage of the diverse data a tailored pre- and post-processing of these heterogenous data sources in the renewable energy applications is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANN&amp;#8217;s results yield, in general, high forecast-skills, indicating a successful learning based on the used training data. Different combinations of inputs and processing-steps were investigated. It is shown that combining various data sources and implement an adequate pre- and post-processing yields the most promising results in the case studies (e.g.: a heuristic to estimate produced power based on the meteorological parameters and prediction of the offset to NWPs tailored to the studied location). Results are compared to traditional forecast methods and statistical methods such as a random forest and multiple-linear-regression.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we proposed implementing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. A relationship between a noisy character image to its clean counter-part are mapped using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.The overall process is divided into two stages: noise type classification and image denoising. Firstly, the noise type classification identifies the types of noise, and based on this noise type, a particular denoising model is selected, which increases the image denoising performance. The denoising network inputs a noisy image and a target of its clean corresponding image during the training. After the mapping function is trained, the generated model performs character image denoising. Then, on each band, a trained mapping function perform image denoising irrespective of the other band. Finally, each block is assembled to generate a clean image. In this paper, the MNIST and Char74K dataset of handwritten digits diluted with artificial noise divided into ten types are used for experimentation.. Our experimental results show that the proposed techniques perform better image denoising ascompared to the existing methods, both in terms of image noise type classification and image denoising. The overall Character recognition accuracy increased by 66% after performing the proposed denoising technique.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations have spread rapidly worldwide performing a variety of military and civilian applications. The ability and performance of UAS to carry out these applications are strongly affected by poor weather conditions. Fog is one of the critical issues that threaten the safety of UAS missions by altering visibility. Therefore, the mission planning based on accurate visibility nowcasts prior to Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) UAS missions will be mandatory to ensure safer UAS operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two types of models are generally considered for visibility nowcasting: physics-based or data-driven models. However, physics-based visibility forecasts remain expensive and difficult to use operationally. Recently, with the increase of the number of available historical data, data-driven models, especially those using deep learning approaches in particular, have attracted increasing attention in weather forecasting and have proven themselves as a powerful prediction tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims at developing a Visibility Nowcasting System (VNS) that improves the performance and the capability of nowcasting the visibility using deep learning over the U.S.. To that end, &amp;#160;a deep neural network, called an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN), is used to demonstrate specifically how basic NWP fields such as temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, etc. and visibility from surface observations can provide accurate visibility nowcasts. The VNS will be then tested in different geographical environments where UAS flights are deployed (for example, over North Dakota) since it can learn the time and space correlation according to the historical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To train the network, we created a labeled data set from available METAR reports and hourly reanalysis data from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model. This dataset will be also used to test the CNN and evaluate their nowcasting performance. The model will be then evaluated in operational use cases and compared to other available visibility observations during fog events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative multi-relay transmission scheme for mobile terminals to exploit spatial diversity. By improving the timeliness of measured channel state information (CSI) through deep learning (DL)-based channel prediction, the proposed scheme remarkably lowers the probability of wrong relay selection arising from outdated CSI in fast time-varying channels. It inherits the simplicity of opportunistic relaying by selecting a single relay, avoiding the complexity of multi-relay coordination and synchronization. Numerical results reveal that it can achieve full diversity gain in slow-fading channels and substantially outperforms the existing schemes in fast-fading wireless environments. Moreover, the computational complexity brought by the DL predictor is negligible compared to off-the-shelf computing hardware.",

Since, Twitter is so extensively utilized throughout the world, the ability to do reliable opinion mining and gauge public opinion and perception on a variety of issues is more vital than ever. Emojis are frequently used to communicate feelings or sentiments that are difficult to express succinctly in language.

The bit error rates (BERs) of these DL methods are compared with the conventional linear minimum mean squared error  (LMMSE) detector. Additionally, the relationships between the BER and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of interfering users (NoI) and modulation type are investigated. Numerical results show that all DL methods outperform LMMSE under different multiuser interference conditions, and FCDNN and LSTM give the best and robust anti-multiuser performance.

Most of these however have non-trivial barriers to use. We introduce the Greifswald Sleep Stage Classifier (GSSC), which is free, open source, and can be relatively easily installed and used on any moderately powered computer. In addition, the GSSC has been trained to perform well on a large variety of electrode set-ups, allowing high performance sleep staging with portable systems. The GSSC can also be readily integrated into brain-computer interfaces for real-time inference. These innovations were achieved while simultaneously reaching a level of accuracy equal to, or exceeding, recent state of the art classifiers and human experts, making the GSSC an excellent choice for researchers in need of reliable, automatic sleep staging.",

        "abstract": "Deep-Learning (DL) is a sub-field of Machine-Learning (ML) whose popularity has grown exponentially during the last decade thanks to its numerous successes related to artificial intelligence, e.g. visual object recognition and detection, image generation, natural language processing or speech recognition. But, like other ML algorithms, DL can be applied to a broader variety of problems, as long as the necessary data is available to train the model. In this aspect, the field of meteorology satisfy the data requirement. Particularly, DL could improve the accuracy of precipitation estimation. Accurate precipitation estimation is a very important product of weather institutes for water supply monitoring, and as input and validation for Numerical Weather Prediction models and precipitation nowcasting. Currently, precipitation are mainly estimated using both radar and rain-gauge data, but an important limitation of this method is the limited coverage of these measurements. A possible solution to this problem could come from satellite radiometers observations. Unfortunately, estimating precipitation accurately from satellite radiometer data is challenging.\nAs a solution, we developed a DL method to merge rain gauge measurements with a ground-based radar composite and satellite radiometer imagery. The proposed convolutional neural network, composed of an encoder&#8211;decoder architecture, performs a multiscale analysis of the three input modalities to estimate simultaneously the rainfall probability and the precipitation rate. We used SEVIRI infrared channels, the OPERA radar composite and the measurements of automatic rain gauges. The training of our model and its performance evaluation are carried out on a dataset spanning 5 years from 2015 to 2019 and covering Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the North Sea.  Our results for instantaneous precipitation detection, instantaneous precipitation rate estimation, and for daily rainfall accumulation estimation show that the best accuracy is obtained for the model combining all three modalities. We show that the combination of rain gauge measurements with radar data allows for a considerable increase in the accuracy of the precipitation estimation, and the addition of satellite imagery provides precipitation estimates where rain gauge and radar coverage are lacking. We also show that our multi-modal model significantly improves performance compared to the European radar composite product provided by OPERA and the quasi gauge-adjusted radar product RADOLAN provided by the DWD for precipitation rate estimation. Additionally, we carried a study of our method on the case of the extreme precipitation event of July 2021 that affected Belgium and Germany, which caused huge societal and economical damage.",

        "abstract": "AbstractArtificial deep convolutional networks (DCNs) meanwhile beat even human performance in challenging tasks. Recently DCNs were shown to also predict real neuronal responses. Their relevance for understanding the neuronal networks in the brain, however, remains questionable. In contrast to the unidirectional architecture of DCNs neurons in cortex are recurrently connected and exchange signals by short pulses, the action potentials. Furthermore, learning in the brain is based on local synaptic mechanisms, in stark contrast to the global optimization methods used in technical deep networks. What is missing is a similarly powerful approach with spiking neurons that employs local synaptic learning mechanisms for optimizing global network performance. Here, we present a framework consisting of mutually coupled local circuits of spiking neurons. The dynamics of the circuits is derived from first principles to optimally encode their respective inputs. From the same global objective function a local learning rule is derived that corresponds to spike-timing dependent plasticity of the excitatory inter-circuit synapses. For deep networks built from these circuits self-organization is based on the ensemble of inputs while for supervised learning the desired outputs are applied in parallel as additional inputs to output layers.Generality of the approach is shown with Boolean functions and its functionality is demonstrated with an image classification task, where networks of spiking neurons approach the performance of their artificial cousins. Since the local circuits operate independently and in parallel, the novel framework not only meets a fundamental property of the brain but also allows for the construction of special hardware. We expect that this will in future enable investigations of very large network architectures far beyond current DCNs, including also large scale models of cortex where areas consisting of many local circuits form a complex cyclic network.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThe serotonergic system modulates brain processes via functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons with heterogeneous properties, including their electrophysiological activity. In extracellular recordings, serotonergic neurons to be investigated for their functional properties are commonly identified on the basis of “typical” features of their activity, i.e. slow regular firing and relatively long duration of spikes. Thus, due to the lack of equally robust criteria for discriminating serotonergic neurons with “atypical” features from non-serotonergic cells, the physiological relevance of the diversity of serotonergic neuron activities results largely understudied.New MethodsWe propose deep learning models capable of discriminating typical and atypical serotonergic neurons from non-serotonergic cells with high accuracy. The research utilized electrophysiological in vitro recordings from serotonergic neurons identified by the expression of fluorescent proteins specific to the serotonergic system and non-serotonergic cells. These recordings formed the basis of the training, validation, and testing data for the deep learning models. The study employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known for their efficiency in pattern recognition, to classify neurons based on the specific characteristics of their action potentials.ResultsThe models were trained on a dataset comprising 43,327 original spike samples, alongside an extensive set of 6.7 million synthetic spike samples, designed to mitigate the risk of overfitting the background noise in the recordings, a potential source of bias. Results show that the models achieved high accuracy and were further validated on “non-homogeneous” data, i.e., data not used for constructing the model, to confirm their robustness and reliability in real-world experimental conditions.Comparison with existing methodsConventional methods for identifying serotonergic neurons allow recognition of serotonergic neurons defined as typical. Our model based on the analysis of the sole spike reliably recognizes over 92 features of spike and activity.ConclusionsThe model is ready for use in experiments conducted with the here described recording parameters. We release the codes and procedures allowing to adapt the model to different acquisition parameters or for identification of other classes of spontaneously active neurons.PACS87.19.L, 87.19.lv, 87.85.dm, 07.05.Mh, 87.85.Tu",

        "abstract": "The simulation of oceanic phenomena plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting climate change, as well as in protecting marine ecosystems, sustainable utilization of marine resources, and effective disaster prevention and mitigation. These simulations are typically based on the Navier-Stokes equations; however, traditional numerical solutions are computationally expensive and present numerous challenges. With the advancement of deep learning technology, the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Navier-Stokes equations has become a burgeoning field, promising significant improvements in computational efficiency. However, existing methods are heavily dependent on extensive fluid model data and suffer from limited generalizability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel, self-supervised, and highly generalizable numerical solution method for the Navier-Stokes equations. This method integrates convolutional neural networks under physical supervision, thereby allowing the equation to be solved and a variety of oceanic phenomena to be simulated without resorting to traditional fluid simulation data. Our experimental results indicate that this method can efficiently and effectively simulate oceanic phenomena under various environmental conditions, with its validity corroborated by alignment with observations from the SDGSAT-1 satellite. This study offers an efficient and innovative tool for the simulation and analysis of oceanic phenomena, thereby contributing significantly to climate research and marine resource management.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDeep learning has been successful at predicting epigenomic profiles from DNA sequences. Most approaches frame this task as a binary classification relying on peak callers to define functional activity. Recently, quantitative models have emerged to directly predict the experimental coverage values as a regression. As new models continue to emerge with different architectures and training configurations, a major bottleneck is forming due to the lack of ability to fairly assess the novelty of proposed models and their utility for downstream biological discovery. Here we introduce a unified evaluation framework and use it to compare various binary and quantitative models trained to predict chromatin accessibility data. We highlight various modeling choices that affect generalization performance, including a downstream application of predicting variant effects. In addition, we introduce a robustness metric that can be used to enhance model selection and improve variant effect predictions. Our empirical study largely supports that quantitative modeling of epigenomic profiles leads to better generalizability and interpretability.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly being used in the development of new therapeutic drugs, in areas such as cancer therapy and hypertension. Additionally, they are seen as an alternative to antibiotics due to the increasing occurrence of bacterial resistance. Wet-laboratory experimental identification, however, is both time consuming and costly, so in-silico models are now commonly used in order to screen new AMP candidates. This paper proposes a novel approach of creating model inputs; using pre-trained language models to produce contextualized embeddings representing the amino acids within each peptide sequence, before a convolutional neural network is then trained as the classifier. The optimal model was validated on two datasets, being one previously used in AMP prediction research, and an independent dataset, created by this paper. Predictive accuracies of 93.33% and 88.26% were achieved respectively, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art classification models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTime series classification can be categorized into two main types: univariate and multivariate. The major difference between the two is that multivariate datasets have multiple dimensions, which makes them more intricate than univariate datasets. Selecting a suitable classifier for multivariate time series classification can be challenging, as it involves trying out several algorithms to handle the intricate data. While some studies have been conducted on automatically finding suitable classifiers for univariate datasets, there are currently no such studies for multivariate ones. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a recommendation system for deep-learning classifiers that are suitable for multivariate time series classification. The experiments demonstrate that this recommendation system can automatically identify the suitable deep-learning classifier for some multivariate time series datasets.",

        "abstract": "Water distribution networks are often susceptible to pipeline leaks caused by mechanical damages, natural hazards, corrosion, and other factors. This paper focuses on the detection of leaks in water distribution networks (WDN) using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. A hybrid Autoencoder neural network (AE) is developed, which utilizes unsupervised learning to address the issue of unbalanced data (as anomalies are rare events). The AE consists of a 3DCNN encoder, a ConvLSTM decoder, and a ConvLSTM future predictor, making the anomaly detection robust. Additionally, spatial, and temporal attention mechanisms are employed to enhance leak localization. The AE first learns the expected behavior and subsequently detects leaks by identifying deviations from this expected behavior. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) Simulator is utilized to generate water pressure and flow rate data in a water supply network. Various conditions such as fluctuating water demands, data noise, and the presence of leaks are considered using the pressure-driven demand (PDD) method. Datasets with and without pipe leaks are obtained, where the AE is trained using the dataset without leaks and tested using the dataset with simulated pipe leaks. The results, based on a benchmark WDN and a confusion matrix analysis, demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identifies leaks in 96% of cases and a false positive rate of 4% compared to a random forest model baseline based on supervised learning with a false positive rate of 15% due to unbalanced data. Furthermore, a real case study demonstrates the applicability of the developed model for leak detection in operational conditions of water supply networks using inline sensor data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThe serotonergic system modulates brain processes via functionally distinct subpopulations of neurons with heterogeneous properties, including their electrophysiological activity. In extracellular recordings, serotonergic neurons to be investigated for their functional properties are commonly identified on the basis of “typical” features of their activity, i.e. slow regular firing and relatively long duration of spikes. Thus, due to the lack of equally robust criteria for discriminating serotonergic neurons with “atypical” features from non-serotonergic cells, the physiological relevance of the diversity of serotonergic neuron activities results largely understudied.New MethodsWe propose deep learning models capable of discriminating typical and atypical serotonergic neurons from non-serotonergic cells with high accuracy. The research utilized electrophysiological in vitro recordings from serotonergic neurons identified by the expression of fluorescent proteins specific to the serotonergic system and non-serotonergic cells. These recordings formed the basis of the training, validation, and testing data for the deep learning models. The study employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known for their efficiency in pattern recognition, to classify neurons based on the specific characteristics of their action potentials.ResultsThe models were trained on a dataset comprising 43,327 original spike samples, alongside an extensive set of 6.7 million synthetic spike samples, designed to mitigate the risk of overfitting the background noise in the recordings, a potential source of bias. Results show that the models achieved high accuracy and were further validated on “non-homogeneous” data, i.e., data not used for constructing the model, to confirm their robustness and reliability in real-world experimental conditions.Comparison with existing methodsConventional methods for identifying serotonergic neurons allow recognition of serotonergic neurons defined as typical. Our model based on the analysis of the sole spike reliably recognizes over 92 features of spike and activity.ConclusionsThe model is ready for use in experiments conducted with the here described recording parameters. We release the codes and procedures allowing to adapt the model to different acquisition parameters or for identification of other classes of spontaneously active neurons.PACS87.19.L, 87.19.lv, 87.85.dm, 07.05.Mh, 87.85.Tu",

        "abstract": "The simulation of oceanic phenomena plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting climate change, as well as in protecting marine ecosystems, sustainable utilization of marine resources, and effective disaster prevention and mitigation. These simulations are typically based on the Navier-Stokes equations; however, traditional numerical solutions are computationally expensive and present numerous challenges. With the advancement of deep learning technology, the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Navier-Stokes equations has become a burgeoning field, promising significant improvements in computational efficiency. However, existing methods are heavily dependent on extensive fluid model data and suffer from limited generalizability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel, self-supervised, and highly generalizable numerical solution method for the Navier-Stokes equations. This method integrates convolutional neural networks under physical supervision, thereby allowing the equation to be solved and a variety of oceanic phenomena to be simulated without resorting to traditional fluid simulation data. Our experimental results indicate that this method can efficiently and effectively simulate oceanic phenomena under various environmental conditions, with its validity corroborated by alignment with observations from the SDGSAT-1 satellite. This study offers an efficient and innovative tool for the simulation and analysis of oceanic phenomena, thereby contributing significantly to climate research and marine resource management.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDeep learning has been successful at predicting epigenomic profiles from DNA sequences. Most approaches frame this task as a binary classification relying on peak callers to define functional activity. Recently, quantitative models have emerged to directly predict the experimental coverage values as a regression. As new models continue to emerge with different architectures and training configurations, a major bottleneck is forming due to the lack of ability to fairly assess the novelty of proposed models and their utility for downstream biological discovery. Here we introduce a unified evaluation framework and use it to compare various binary and quantitative models trained to predict chromatin accessibility data. We highlight various modeling choices that affect generalization performance, including a downstream application of predicting variant effects. In addition, we introduce a robustness metric that can be used to enhance model selection and improve variant effect predictions. Our empirical study largely supports that quantitative modeling of epigenomic profiles leads to better generalizability and interpretability.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are increasingly being used in the development of new therapeutic drugs, in areas such as cancer therapy and hypertension. Additionally, they are seen as an alternative to antibiotics due to the increasing occurrence of bacterial resistance. Wet-laboratory experimental identification, however, is both time consuming and costly, so in-silico models are now commonly used in order to screen new AMP candidates. This paper proposes a novel approach of creating model inputs; using pre-trained language models to produce contextualized embeddings representing the amino acids within each peptide sequence, before a convolutional neural network is then trained as the classifier. The optimal model was validated on two datasets, being one previously used in AMP prediction research, and an independent dataset, created by this paper. Predictive accuracies of 93.33% and 88.26% were achieved respectively, outperforming all previous state-of-the-art classification models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTime series classification can be categorized into two main types: univariate and multivariate. The major difference between the two is that multivariate datasets have multiple dimensions, which makes them more intricate than univariate datasets. Selecting a suitable classifier for multivariate time series classification can be challenging, as it involves trying out several algorithms to handle the intricate data. While some studies have been conducted on automatically finding suitable classifiers for univariate datasets, there are currently no such studies for multivariate ones. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a recommendation system for deep-learning classifiers that are suitable for multivariate time series classification. The experiments demonstrate that this recommendation system can automatically identify the suitable deep-learning classifier for some multivariate time series datasets.",

        "abstract": "Water distribution networks are often susceptible to pipeline leaks caused by mechanical damages, natural hazards, corrosion, and other factors. This paper focuses on the detection of leaks in water distribution networks (WDN) using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. A hybrid Autoencoder neural network (AE) is developed, which utilizes unsupervised learning to address the issue of unbalanced data (as anomalies are rare events). The AE consists of a 3DCNN encoder, a ConvLSTM decoder, and a ConvLSTM future predictor, making the anomaly detection robust. Additionally, spatial, and temporal attention mechanisms are employed to enhance leak localization. The AE first learns the expected behavior and subsequently detects leaks by identifying deviations from this expected behavior. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the Water Network Tool for Resilience (WNTR) Simulator is utilized to generate water pressure and flow rate data in a water supply network. Various conditions such as fluctuating water demands, data noise, and the presence of leaks are considered using the pressure-driven demand (PDD) method. Datasets with and without pipe leaks are obtained, where the AE is trained using the dataset without leaks and tested using the dataset with simulated pipe leaks. The results, based on a benchmark WDN and a confusion matrix analysis, demonstrate that the proposed method successfully identifies leaks in 96% of cases and a false positive rate of 4% compared to a random forest model baseline based on supervised learning with a false positive rate of 15% due to unbalanced data. Furthermore, a real case study demonstrates the applicability of the developed model for leak detection in operational conditions of water supply networks using inline sensor data.",

Simulating these environments is very complex and needs a solid framework. This paper uses a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to better schedule ambulance dispatch problem during those disasters. The concept of a call and assignment of ambulances are illustrated and the elements of states, rewards, and actions in the formulations are described. The algorithm steps for solving this problem are also presented. This paper can help disaster planners to have a better idea for better scheduling ambulances.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGalaxy is a web-based and open-source scientific data-processing platform. Researchers compose pipelines in Galaxy to analyse scientific data. These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To make creating workflows easier, faster and less error-prone, a predictive system is developed to recommend tools facilitating further analysis. A model is created to recommend tools by analysing workflows, composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server, using a deep learning approach. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units (GRU) neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network (RNN). The weights of tools used in the neural network training are derived from their usage frequencies over a period of time. The hyper-parameters of the neural network are optimised using Bayesian optimisation. An accuracy of 97% in predicting tools is achieved by the model for precision@1, precision@2 and precision@3 metrics. It is accessed by a Galaxy API to recommend tools in real-time. Multiple user interface (UI) integrations on the server communicate with this API to apprise researchers of these recommended tools interactively.Contactkumara@informatik.uni-freiburg.degruening@informatik.uni-freiburg.debackofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.de",

Therefore, there is an obvious need to accurately identify the vital mutation sites and understand the complex patterns of mutation effect of viral protein. However, existing work do not explicitly modelling vital positions functioning for virus fitness, leading to large search space with money- and time-consuming search cost. Here, we propose EVPMM (evolutionary integrated viral protein mutation machine), a co-evolution profiles integrated deep learning framework for dominant variants forecasting, vital mutation sites prediction and fitness landscape depicting. It consists of a position detector to directly detect the functional positions as well as a mutant predictor to depict fitness landscape. Moreover, pairwise dependencies between residues obtained by a Markov Random Field are also incorporated to promote reasonable variant generation. We show that EVPMM significantly outperforms existing machine learning algorithms on mutation position detection, residue prediction and fitness prediction accuracies. Remarkably, there is a highly agreement between positions identified by our method with current variants of concern and provides some new mutation pattern hypothesis. The method can prioritize mutations as they emerge for public health concern.",

        "abstract": "Ice flows in response to stresses according to the flow law that involves ice viscosity. An accurate description of effective ice viscosity is essential for predicting the mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, yet measurement of ice viscosity is challenging at a continental scale. Lab experiments of polycrystalline ice shows that the effective viscosity of ice obeys a power-law relation with the strain rate, known as Glen&#8217;s flow law. However, it remains unclear how processes at ice-shelf scales impact the effective viscosity of glacial ice. Here, we leverage the availability of remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning to infer the effective ice viscosity and examine the rheology, i.e. flow law, &#160;of glacial ice in Antarctic Ice Shelves. We find that the rheology of ice shelves differs substantially between the compression and extension zones. In the compression zone near the grounding line the rheology of ice closely obeys power laws with exponents in the range 1<n<3, consistent with prior laboratory experiments. In the extension zone, which comprises most of the total ice-shelf area, ice performs complex rheological behavior, deviating from laboratory findings. We also discover the areas where ice viscosity appears non-isotropic.",

        "abstract": "Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds are commonly acquired to describe a 3D shape of terrain and attributes of objects and landforms located on it. They proved to be useful in a variety of applications, including geometrical characterization of both man-made and natural objects and landforms. Usually, the first step of point cloud processing is classification. As a result, its accuracy highly influences the results of subsequent processing. Therefore, reliable and automatic point cloud classification is of key importance in most of the ALS data applications.Recently, deep learning techniques attracted the attention of the community in the context of point cloud classification. However, the reproducibility of the trained deep learning networks remains unexplored because there is too little accessible and precisely classified 3D training data. Recently many countries have published their national ALS data sets. This initiative leads to promising options for deep learning classification of point clouds as it allows for comprehensive training of deep networks.In this study we present the investigations that aimed at creation of a universal, deep learning based classifier that will be able to classify point clouds of varying characteristics. The experiments were carried out using selected parts of data sets that have been made available by three European countries: Poland, Austria and Switzerland. The point clouds were classified into four classes: ground and water, vegetation, buildings and bridges, and others. The results of the experiments showed that it is possible to achieve high overall accuracy of the classification for the ground and water (above 98%), vegetation (92-97%, depending on a test site), and building and bridges (92-96%, depending on a test site). A lower overall accuracy was achieved for class others because of a very high variability of geometry of objects that belong to this class. Furthermore, in some cases, adding training data from a different country to the initial training data resulted in improved classification accuracy in selected classes and reduced dataset-specific errors.As a result, this study proves that it is possible to create a universal, deep learning based classifier that will be able to maintain high classification accuracy while it processes data sets of different characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Earth observation (EO) data are critical for monitoring the state of planet Earth and can be helpful for various real-world applications [1]. Although numerous benchmark datasets have been released, there is no unified platform for developing and fairly comparing deep learning models on EO data [2]. For deep learning methods, the backbone networks, hyper-parameters, and training details are influential factors while comparing the performances.. However, existing works usually neglect these details and even evaluate the performance with different training/validation/test dataset splits. This makes it difficult to fairly and reliably compare different algorithms. In this study, we introduce the EarthNets platform, an open deep-learning platform for remote sensing and Earth observation. The platform is based on PyTorch [3] and TorchData. There are about ten different libraries, covering different tasks in remote sensing. Among them, Dataset4EO is designed as a standard and easy-to-use data-loading library, which can be used alone or together with other high-level libraries like RSI-Classification (for image classification), RSI-Detection (for object detection), RSI-Segmentation (for semantic segmentation), and so on. Two factors are considered for the design of the EarthNets platform: the first one is the decoupling between dataset loading and high-level EO tasks. As there are more than 400 RS datasets with different data modalities, research domains, and download links, efficient preparation of analysis-ready data can largely accelerate the research for the whole community. The other factor is to bring advances in machine learning to EO by providing new deep-learning models. The EarthNets platform provides a fair and consistent evaluation of deep learning methods on remote sensing and Earth observation data [4]. It also helps bring together the remote sensing and a larger machine-learning community.

Analysis of COVID-19 related genetic pathways allows for a better understanding of the possible effects and sequelae of the disease. Using 6178 scRNA sequenced human cells, having a status of control/mild/severe COVID-19 disease status, differential expression of genes and pathways was analyzed. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), mild COVID-19 was found to over-express the Influenza Pathway. In order to identify genes important in COVID-19 severity, a deep learning classifier was trained. Classifiers were repeatedly trained for this task using 10 randomly selected genes from the total number of 18,958 genes. The highest performing classifier (AUC = 0.748) was trained using: AC008626.1, SGO1, RHOBTB2, RBM41, NDUFAF4P1, COX5A, ZDHHC17, STX11, IPP, NUDT5 genes.

Deep learning is a growing trend in the edge of technology and its applications are now seen in many aspects of our life such as object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc. Currently, almost all major sciences and technologies are benefiting from the advantages of deep learning such as high accuracy, speed and flexibility. Therefore, any efforts in improving performance of related techniques is valuable. Deep learning accelerators are considered as hardware architecture, which are designed and optimized for increasing speed, efficiency and accuracy of computers that are running deep learning algorithms. In this paper, after reviewing some backgrounds on deep learning, a well-known accelerator architecture named MAERI (Multiply-Accumulate Engine with Reconfigurable interconnects) is investigated. Performance of a deep learning task is measured and compared in two different data flow strategies: NLR (No Local Reuse) and NVDLA (NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator), using an open source tool called MAESTRO (Modeling Accelerator Efficiency via Spatio-Temporal Resource Occupancy). Measured performance indicators of novel optimized architecture, NVDLA shows higher L1 and L2 computation reuse, and lower total runtime (cycles) in comparison to the other one.",

It is a soil-borne disease that affects leaves of plants. In the current research, the emphasis is on the early diagnosis and prevention of plant leaf disease. In this paper, strawberry, tomato, pepper bell, and potato disease detection network (STPP- DDN) based on Faster R-CNN and multi-task learning. STPP-ddn is developed which leverages attention mechanisms in feature extraction. STPP-DDN detects disease based on plant symptoms. Unlike other approaches for diagnosing disease from the total plant look, the STPP-DDN automatically classifies the petioles and young leaves. A large dataset with number of photos divided into various groups is constructed to serve as a basis for analyzing and testing our proposed technique. Each image also includes a label that indicates whether or not the plants has been affected. With the proposed STPP-DDN, we achieved a mAP of 77:54% on object detection of 4 categories and 99:95% accuracy for strawberry verticillium wilt detection.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nToday, it seems natural to discuss Artificial Intelligence or, if you prefer, Machine Learning. Many observers of digital marketing and tourism trends in recent years have not missed an opportunity to emphasize how these technologies will become increasingly prevalent and pervasive in our digital age, especially in the travel and tourism sector. But what are machine learning and deep learning? They are branches of artificial intelligence that provide computers with the ability to ’learn without being explicitly programmed’. In essence, when properly trained, artificial intelligence can respond to novel situations based on reasoning and past experiences. This technology, particularly artificial intelligence in tourism, paves new pathways allowing the automation of tasks that were previously done manually. Even in the hospitality industry, it can be successfully deployed for guest assistance tasks, both before and during their stay. Having an assistant on the site communicating with the visitor in real-time without any delay is an effective way to convert them into a customer. Statistics are confirming a correlation between response time to inquiries and the site’s conversion rate. Moreover, during the stay, the use of chatbots has proven its worth. Having a continuously active assistant ready to respond is undoubtedly a boon for the establishment. It also includes activities where there’s a need to understand the guest’s requirements and make decisions, such as recommending services to the guest or preparing a quote. Fortunately, the future will not solely consist of chatbots and robots. A new era of tourism is on the horizon, where humans will spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time catering to and entertaining guests in ways that, for now, only we humans can. In this study, we utilized data from several hotel reviews. Each review represents a client’s assessment of a hotel. For each textual review, we aim to predict whether it corresponds to a positive review (the customer is satisfied) or a negative review (the customer is dissatisfied). The overall ratings of the reviews can range from 2.5/10 to 10/10. To simplify the issue, we’ll categorize them as follows: negative reviews have overall ratings of less than 5; positive reviews have ratings of 5 or higher. The challenge lies in predicting this information using only the raw textual data of the review.",

Due to its major consequences in regard to critical tasks such as Information Retrieval, Question Answering, Text Summarization, and Natural Language Understanding, categorization of texts has grown in importance in many real-world applications. Text classification can be done in two different ways: manual and automatic classification. In the manual text classification, A human annotator interprets the substance of text and categorizes it suitably in classification. This procedure normally produces good results, although it is time-consuming and costly. While automatic the task of automatically assigned semantic categories to natural language text, has become one of the methods for organized online information. Despite the fact that several works are done for multi label classification in English and other languages. However, very few works have been worked for multi label classification in the Afaan Oromo language and this due the lack of resources. Most researchers have applied a machine learning approach for classification in Afaan Oromo while no researchers have used a deep learning approach for multi label classification task. Afaan Oromo news texts data are collected from different sources such OBC, FBC and BBC Afaan Oromo. We use the LSTM model using the training dataset and for the classification process. The proposed model is pass through the process of: -preprocessing, wordembedding, deep network building, training the model and classification. To predict class label, the word embedding is used separately and in various combinations through several channels of LSTM, including a single layer and a three-layer with nine outputs, Sigmoid activation functions, and binary cross entropy loss functions. we used software Python to pre-process the data and design the model. Finally, the multi label Afaan Oromo text classification model achieves an accuracy. Micro -F1 90.20% and 83% value for the best for six and nine and macro F1 90.20%and 85.41% for six and nine class respectively.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTDifferential analysis occupies the most significant portion of the standard practices of RNA-Seq analysis. However, the conventional method is matching the tumor samples to the normal samples, which are both from the same tumor type. The output using such method would fail in differentiating tumor types because it lacks the knowledge from other tumor types. Pan-Cancer Atlas provides us with abundant information on 33 prevalent tumor types which could be used as prior knowledge to generate tumor-specific biomarkers. In this paper, we embedded the high dimensional RNA-Seq data into 2-D images and used a convolutional neural network to make classification of the 33 tumor types. The final accuracy we got was 95.59%, higher than another paper applying GA/KNN method on the same dataset. Based on the idea of Guided Grad Cam, as to each class, we generated significance heat-map for all the genes. By doing functional analysis on the genes with high intensities in the heat-maps, we validated that these top genes are related to tumor-specific pathways, and some of them have already been used as biomarkers, which proved the effectiveness of our method. As far as we know, we are the first to apply convolutional neural network on Pan-Cancer Atlas for classification, and we are also the first to match the significance of classification with the importance of genes. Our experiment results show that our method has a good performance and could also apply in other genomics data.",

        "abstract": "Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for identifying diffuse liver disorders, it is an intrusive procedure with a host of negative side effects. Physician subjectivity may affect the ultrasonography diagnosis of diffuse liver disease. As a result, there is still a clear need for an appropriate classification of liver illnesses. In this article, an unique deep classifier made up of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that have already been trained is proposed to categories the liver condition. The variants of ResNet and AlexNet are a few networks that are combined with fully connected networks (FCNs). Transfer learning can be used to extract deep features that can offer adequate categorization data. Then, an FCN can depict images of the disease in its many stages, including tissue, liver hepatitis, and hepatitis. To discriminate between these liver images, three different (normal/cirrhosis, perfectly natural, and cirrhosis/hepatitis) and 3 (normal/cirrhosis/hepatitis) models were trained. A hybrid classifier is presented in order to integrate the graded odds of the classes produced by each individual classifier since two-class classifiers performed better than three-class classifiers. The class with the highest score is then chosen using a majority voting technique. The experimental results demonstrate an high accuracy when liver images were divided into three classes using ResNet50 and a hybrid classifier.",

        "abstract": "Artificial  Intelligence  and  Deep  Learning  are  good  fields  of  research.  Recently,  the  brother of Artificial Intelligence titled \"Artificial Satisfaction\" was introduced in literature [10]. In this article, we coin the term “Deep Loving”. After the publication of this article, \"Deep Loving\" will be considered  as  the  friend  of  Deep  Learning.  Proposing  a  new  field  is  different  from  proposing  a  new algorithm. In this paper, we strongly focus on defining and introducing \"Deep Loving Field\" to  Research  Scientists  across  the  globe.  The  future  of  the  \"Deep  Loving\"  field  is  predicted  by  showing  few  future  opportunities  in  this  new  field.  The  definition  of  Deep  Learning  is  shown  followed by a literature review of the \"Deep Loving\" field. The World's First Deep Loving Algorithm (WFDLA) is designed and implemented in this work by adding Deep Loving concepts to Particle Swarm  Optimization  Algorithm.  Results  obtained  by  WFDLA  are  compared  with  the  PSO  algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Data sets for medical images are generally imbalanced and limited in sample size because of high data collection costs, time-consuming annotations, and patient privacy concerns. The training of deep neural network classification models on these data sets to improve the generalization ability does not produce the desired results for classifying the medical condition accurately and often overfit the data on the majority of class samples. To address the issue, we propose a framework for improving the classification performance metrics of deep neural network classification models using transfer learning: pre-trained models, such as Xception, InceptionResNet, DenseNet along with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) – based data augmentation. Then, we trained the network by combining traditional data augmentation techniques, such as randomly flipping the image left to right and GAN-based data augmentation, and then fine-tuned the hyper-parameters of the transfer learning models, such as the learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. With these configurations, the Xception model outperformed all other pre-trained models achieving a test accuracy of 98.7%, the precision of 99%, recall of 99.3%, f1-score of 99.1%, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) - area under the curve (AUC) of 98.2%.",

Skeleton data includes two or three dimensional coordinates of body joints. All of the body joints are not effective in recognizing different activities, so finding key joints within a video and across different activities has a significant role in improving the performance. In this paper we propose a novel framework that performs joint selection in skeleton video frames for the purpose of human activity recognition. To this end, we formulate the joint selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where we employ deep reinforcement learning to find the most informative joints per frame. The proposed joint selection method is a general framework that can be employed to improve human activity classification methods. Experimental results on two benchmark activity recognition data sets using three different classifiers demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed joint selection method.</div>",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Energy transport in the atmosphere is accomplished by systems of several length scales, from cyclones to Rossby waves. From recently developed Fourier and wavelet based methods it has been found that the planetary component of the latent heat transport affects the Arctic surface temperatures more than its dry-static counterpart and the synoptic scale component of the latent heat transport. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, both the Fourier and wavelet based methods require enormous amounts of data and are time consuming to process. The Fourier and wavelet decompositions are computed &amp;#160;from 6 hourly data, throughout the whole vertical column of the atmosphere. The data required are usually only available from reanalysis archives, or possibly from climate model experiments where a goal is to examine the decomposed energy transport. However, the vast CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives are out of reach for the exact computations of the Fourier and wavelet decompositions. Even if all the data were available in the CMIP archives, it would be a computationally, and storage-wise, intensive task to compute the Fourier and wavelet decompositions for a large selection of the CMIP experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we suggest a deep-learning approach to approximate the decomposed energy transport from significantly less data than the original methods. The idea is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on ERA5 data, where we have already computed the Fourier decomposition of the energy transport. The CNN is trained on data at 850hPa in the atmosphere on a daily temporal resolution. The required data are only a small fraction of the data required to compute the exact Fourier decompositon of the energy transport. Once the CNN is trained, the model is tested on data from the EC-Earth climate model. For EC-Earth we have an ensemble of model runs where the energy transport is decomposed using the Fourier method, hence the CNN may be evaluated on the EC-Earth dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNN based energy transport decomposition matches well with the classically computed energy transport from EC-Earth.The CNN captures the mean meridional transport well, and the projected changes from the 1950s to the 2090s in EC-Earth. Additionally the CNN model captures the day to day variability well, as regressions of temperature on the transport from the CNNcomputations and the classical Fourier decomposition are similar. Further we may investigate how the decomposed energy transport changes in a range of CMIP models and experiments&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surface wind is an extremely difficult parameter to predict, particularly in the complex topography of the Alps. Due to several important processes happening at sub-kilometer scale, even high resolution Numerical Weather Prediction models such as COSMO-1 still present substantial biases. To address this, a wide range of statistical post-processing methods are used. Recently, methods based on Deep Learning have emerged as a new solution and are now actively developed at many weather services, including MeteoSwiss. At the same time, efforts are made to obtain accurate representations of surface wind speed up to a few hours ahead by integrating all available information in real-time, an approach known as nowcasting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the aim of seamlessly combining nowcasting and post-processing approaches for surface wind speed predictions, we developed a Deep Learning probabilistic post-processing model that is also able to integrate real time observations, and developed a new metric, the Similarity Index, for this purpose. The Similarity Index is a way to estimate the correlation of surface wind speed between two locations, based on their position and geomorphological setting, and can be used to choose the best available observation to be used at any point in space at any given time, and weigh that observation in a way that mimics geostatistical interpolation methods. The proposed methodology yields improved forecasts of wind speed where both systematic and random errors are reduced, thanks to the post-processing and nowcasting components respectively. In a second phase, we implemented a state- of-the-art explainability framework for machine learning, SHAP, and presented how it can be used to get insights into the model and build trust in the results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

It provides valuable insights that can be of tremendous help to protein’s function research and the detection of potential cell surface/secreted drug targets. The prediction of protein subcellular localization using bioinformatics methods is an inexpensive option to experimentally approaches. Many computational tools have been built during the past two decades, however, producing reliable prediction has always been the challenge. In this study, a Deep learning (DL) technique is proposed to enhance the precision of the analytical engine of one of these tools called PSORTb v3.0. Its conventional SVM machine learning model was replaced by the state-of-the-art DL method (BiLSTM) and a Data augmentation measure (SeqGAN). As a result, the combination of BiLSTM and SeqGAN outperformed SVM by improving its precision from 57.4% to 75%. This method was applied on a dataset containing 8230 protein sequences, which was experimentally derived by Brinkman Lab. The presented model provides promising outcomes for the future research. The source code of the model is available athttps://github.com/mgetech/SubLoc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nToday, captcha is a common method for preventing automated programs from accessing online resources like websites, emails, etc. Captcha is an acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing test to differentiate between computers and humans. It is a challenge-response test that determines whether the user is a person or a computer. There are various varieties of captcha techniques, including audio-based, text-based, and image-based, etc. Image-based captchas, in which the user is required to recognize and enter a combination of letters and numbers displayed in an image, are extensively used among these techniques. In this endeavor, we’ve employed deep learning techniques to improve the precision of alphanumeric-based captcha solving. We used a real-time dataset to make predictions with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Combination of CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Neural Network with Nested Design model. TensorFlow, Keras, OCR, OpenCV, and Tkinter were used to create the model, and Tkinter is used for the image selection user interface. We used a dataset from Kaggle in which all the images are five-letter words that may contain digits, and noise (blur and a line) has been applied to the images. The images are PNGs measuring 200 by 50 pixels. We divided the dataset into train and test sets, calculated the accuracy, and provided an image captcha prediction. The goal of the project is to increase the accuracy of the model by comparing the outcomes of various deep learning techniques. This project aims to determine which deep learning technique provides the highest level of accuracy for solving alphanumeric-based captchas by comparing the accuracy of various deep learning techniques. This project’s outcomes can be utilized to improve the security of other captcha techniques.",

The hypothesis is that GP non-parametric and non-differentiable learning units (abstract syntax trees) have the same learning and representation capacity to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In an analogy to the traditional ANN/Gradient Descend/Backpropagation DL approach, the proposed framework aims at building a DL alike model fully based on GP.

This paper proposes a DND-P (Deep Model in Nacos Discovery Protocol) protocol to realize the rapid integration of deep learning models and microservice architectures. First, this paper selects three representative deep learning models DCN (Deep & Cross Network), DeepFM and xDeepFM in the field of CTR (Click Through Rate) as the research objects, and randomly samples 600,000 of them from the Criteo public data set. The model is trained with 10,000 sample sets to obtain a relatively stable model version. Second, use the Django framework to integrate the trained model as a web application. Finally, the DND-P protocol is directly referenced in Django to implement service registration in the microservice architecture, and the CTR is estimated at the business layer through OpenFeign. Through experiments, it is concluded that the integration of microservice architecture and deep learning model with DND-P protocol can break the barriers between the two, so as to quickly realize the integration of business applications.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Due to anthropogenic climate change, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters is only increasing. As supercomputing capabilities increase in an era of computational geosciences, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key tool in assessing the progression and impact of these disasters. Recovery from extreme weather events is aided by machine learning-based systems trained on multitemporal satellite imagery data. We work on shifting paradigms by seeking to understand the inner decision-making process (interpretability) of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for damage assessment in buildings after natural disasters, as these deep learning algorithms are typically black boxes. We compare the efficacy of models trained on different input modalities, including combinations of the pre-disaster image, the post-disaster image, the disaster type, and the ground truth of neighboring buildings. Furthermore, we experiment with different loss functions, and find that ordinal cross entropy loss is the most effective criterion for optimization. Finally, we visualize inputs by creating gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) on the data, with the end goal of deployment. Earth observation data harnessed by deep learning and computer vision is not only useful for disaster assessment, but also in understanding the other impacts of our changing climate from marine ecology to agriculture in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;",

In this paper we propose a novel framework that performs joint selection in skeleton video frames for the purpose of human activity recognition. To this end, we formulate the joint selection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where we employ deep reinforcement learning to find the most informative joints per frame. The proposed joint selection method is a general framework that can be employed to improve human activity classification methods. Experimental results on two benchmark activity recognition data sets using three different classifiers demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed joint selection method.</div>",

Digital image processing and Deep Learning technologies enable us to develop an automatic system for the diagnosis/detection of various kind of diseases and abnormalities. The tumor detection system may include image enhancement, segmentation, data augmentation, features extraction and classification; all these steps are discussed in details in the above sections. To work on CNNs, powerful GPU based system are required to speed up the process, lot of processing is carried out and also lot of RAM is required to process the images for testing. CNNs have also some options such as optimization technique selection, Number of Epoch, Batch size, iteration and learning rate. These options are tuned to get the optimal results from the CNN model. Learning rate is used to update the weights and bias in training phase, learning rate changes the weights. One Epoch is when the model see all images in training, as the training data maybe of very big sizes, the data in each Epoch is divided into batch sizes. Every epoch has a training and test session, after each Epoch the weights are updated according to the learning rate, optimization algorithms are used to update the learning of a CNN adaptively. When the best weights for training are computed, the model is said to be trained. All the experimental work is carried out in MATLAB simulation tool.",

        "abstract": "Renewable Energy is gaining more importance in tackling globally growing energy demands. However, time-series obtained form production sites are often limited in time-horizon and also different in nature due to present technology in power plants. Due to their high resource demands high-resolution NWPs, such as AROME, can often not be fully stored long-term and change significantly in each update cycle, making them a challenging input for data hungry deep learning approaches. Still, in short- and medium range forecasts selected NWP parameters often improve forecast results of machine learning approaches.\nIn this study, we investigate how to setup a synthetically generated/extended training dataset based on diverse spatially and temporary heterogeneous inputs. For practical reasons, we concentrate on a solar power production case study. Data considered includes NWP models (e.g.: AROME, ECMWF), satellite data and products (e.g.:&#160; CAMS), radiation time series from remote sensing, and observation time-series. In particular, we present a machine learning methodology on extending time-series from AROME in accordance with close observations.&#160; Our synthetic data generator learns from long observation time series, and longer available but still coarse ECMWF. It yields both synthetic observations for missing data in the observation, synthetic production optimized for a relatively new established site, as well as a prolongation of numeric model data for studied renewable energy sites.\nResults are evaluated by our deep learning framework (e.g.: LSTM) and cross-validation or achieved data of the data-set. The combination of real and synthetic data generally offers benefits in forecasting by more complex machine learning methods relying on sufficiently long training data-sets.",

Nevertheless, as ellipsometry is essentially an indirect characterization method, ellipsometry data analysis, which traditionally involves tedious and time-consuming human-expert intervention and requires adequate knowledge and experience to model the optical properties of film materials, has long been universally considered to be challenging. We proposed a smart ellipsometry network (SENet), with which optical constants satisfying the Kramers–Kronig relations can be achieved automatically without any prior knowledge of material optical properties. The proposed method was verified experimentally using a variety of thin films, with the materials covering metals, dielectrics and semiconductors in an ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared broad spectral range. Furthermore, our method demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in the analysis of thin films at different angles of incidence, in different spectral ranges, and prepared on different substrates from those in the generation of the training dataset. The developed method paves the way for ellipsometry as a general characterization technique that allows for the automatic, accurate, and fast determination of material optical properties.",

In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms). We hope this paper inspires further research interest in Text Data Augmentation.",

However, commercial ASR systems usually have poor performance on domain-specific speech especially under low-resource settings. The author works with pre-trained DeepSpeech2 and Wav2Vec2 acoustic models to develop benefit-specific ASR systems. The domainspecific data are collected using proposed semi-supervised learning annotation with little human intervention. The best performance comes from a fine-tuned Wav2Vec2-Large-LV60 acoustic model with an external KenLM, which surpasses the Google and AWS ASR systems on benefit-specific speech. The viability of using error prone ASR transcriptions as part of spoken language understanding (SLU) is also investigated. Results of a benefit-specific natural language understanding (NLU) task show that the domain-specific fine-tuned ASR system can outperform the commercial ASR systems even when its transcriptions have higher word error rate (WER), and the results between fine-tuned ASR and human transcriptions are similar",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNumerous techniques exist for detecting shot or scene boundaries, typically relying on visual characteristics of frames and contrasting said features among adjacent frames to identify shot boundaries. Shot Boundary Detection can utilize a range of visual characteristics such as edge feature, gray intensity, motion vector, and color histogram. The accuracy of Shot Boundary identification methods that currently exist has demonstrated a relatively high level of effectiveness. It is imperative to adapt current techniques to accommodate diverse video content types, as contemporary video productions employ a wider range of video creation methods than their predecessors. The presented approach in this methodology examines the different techniques fr the purpose of achieving the shot boundary detection. The Dual Tree – Discrete Wavelet Transformation approach has been contrasted with the deep learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network. The video is given as input on which frame extraction, feature extraction through Entropy Calculation and Mean Log Estimation is realized with the Deep learning methodologies. The outcomes of the shot boundary identification have been effectively compared with one another to determine performance which is displayed in the later sections of this research article.",

Analysis of COVID-19 related genetic pathways allows for a better understanding of the possible effects and sequelae of the disease. Using 6178 scRNA sequenced human cells, having a status of control/mild/severe COVID-19 disease status, differential expression of genes and pathways was analyzed. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), mild COVID-19 was found to over-express the Influenza Pathway. In order to identify genes important in COVID-19 severity, a deep learning classifier was trained. Classifiers were repeatedly trained for this task using 10 randomly selected genes from the total number of 18,958 genes. The highest performing classifier (AUC=0.748) was trained using: AC008626.1, SGO1, RHOBTB2, RBM41, NDUFAF4P1, COX5A, ZDHHC17, STX11, IPP, NUDT5 genes. These results further illustrate the other factors contributing to mild versus severe COVID-19, as well as evidence of potential misdiagnosis or overlapping pathway effects of Influenza and COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNowadays, healthcare solutions have accomplished radical advancements in developing diagnostic mechanisms using machine and deep learning (DL) based techniques. The symptoms of lung cell cancer are common to many other ailments; hence the healthcare practitioners may make mistakes in identification of lung cancer in early stages. Cancer enters into human body silently and the symptoms such as weakness, weight loss and fever are common to many other ailments which may confuse the physicians to distinguish between cancer symptoms and other ailment symptoms. Cancer is usually detected in lateral stages when it is difficult to control the further spread of cancer in the other parts of the body. Cancer is one of the major causes of the deaths in the youngsters these days. There are many existing techniques which can help in diagnosis of cancer but still there is a need to explore more intelligent mechanisms which not only identify the presence of cancer in the cells but also determine the stages of the cancer for timely treatment. Hence the proposed DL based diagnostic mechanism not only identifies the presence of cancer in lung cells but also determines the respective stage. A DL-based Lung Cell Cancer Detection (DL-LCCD) is suggested in this paper to detect lung cell cancer. The proposed DL-LCCD method determines the cancerous cells with the aid of digital image processing techniques with high accuracy and precision. A Hybrid CNN model is devised to determine the cancer from the CT scanned images. The evaluation metrics are used to test the viability of the proposed DL-LCCD method. The classification accuracy of 95.30% is achieved with 10-fold cross-validation and 96.10% accuracy with 15-fold cross-validation.",

        "abstract": "Social science theories often postulate causal relationships among a set of variables or events. Although directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used to represent these theories, their full potential has not yet been realized in practice. As non-parametric causal models, DAGs require no assumptions about the functional form of the hypothesized relationships. Nevertheless, to simplify the task of empirical evaluation, researchers tend to invoke such assumptions anyway, even though they are typically arbitrary and do not reflect any theoretical content or prior knowledge. Moreover, functional form assumptions can engender bias, whenever they fail to accurately capture the complexity of the causal system under investigation. In this article, we introduce causal-graphical normalizing flows (cGNFs), a novel approach to causal inference that leverages deep neural networks to empirically evaluate theories represented as DAGs. Unlike conventional approaches, cGNFs model the full joint distribution of the data according to a DAG supplied by the analyst, without relying on stringent assumptions about functional form. In this way, the method allows for flexible, semi-parametric estimation of any causal estimand that can be identified from the DAG, including total effects, conditional effects, direct and indirect effects, and path-specific effects. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of Blau and Duncan’s (1967) model of status attainment and Zhou’s (2019) model of conditional versus controlled mobility. To facilitate adoption, we provide open-source software together with a series of online tutorials for implementing cGNFs. The article concludes with a discussion of current limitations and directions for future development.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTNeural networks are important building blocks in technical applications. These artificial neural networks (ANNs) rely on noiseless continuous signals in stark contrast to the discrete action potentials stochastically exchanged among the neurons in real brains. A promising approach towards bridging this gap are the Spike-by-Spike (SbS) networks which represent a compromise between non-spiking and spiking versions of generative models that perform inference on their inputs. What is still missing are algorithms for finding weight sets that would optimize the output performances of deep SbS networks with many layers.Here, a learning rule for hierarchically organized SbS networks is derived. The properties of this approach are investigated and its functionality demonstrated by simulations. In particular, a Deep Convolutional SbS network for classifying handwritten digits (MNIST) is presented. When applied together with an optimizer this learning method achieves a classification performance of roughly 99.3% on the MNIST test data. Thereby it approaches the benchmark results of ANNs without extensive parameter optimization. We envision that with this learning rule SBS networks will provide a new basis for research in neuroscience and for technical applications, especially when they become implemented on specialized computational hardware.",

Due to their flexibility and predictive accuracy, neural networks have ushered in a new wave of data-driven and data-free modeling for physical phenomena. With several key research breakthroughs, modern deep learning architectures are now more accurate and generalizable facilitating improved physics-informed models. This presentation explores the use of several different deep learning approaches for learning physical dynamics including Bayesian neural networks, generative models, physics-constrained learning and self-attention. By leveraging these recent deep neural network advancements and probabilistic frameworks, powerful multiscale deep learning approaches that incorporate known physical constraints as prior knowledge can be used to accurately predict complex mutliscale dynamical features. We will use such techniques together with generative and adversarial AI models to highlight their potential for inversion tasks including the identification of the heterogeneous conductivity field and reconstructing contaminant release history for subsurface remediation.\n",

        "abstract": "Electrical load forecasting (ELF) is gaining importance especially due to the severe impact of climate change on electrical energy usage and dynamically evolving smart grid technologies in the last decades. In this regard, medium-term load forecasting, a crucial need for power system planning (generation optimization and outages plan) and operation control, has become prominent in particular. Machine learning and deep learning-based techniques are currently trending approaches in electrical load estimation due to their capability to model complex non-linearity, feature abstraction and high accuracy, especially in the smart power systems environment.\r\nIn this study, several load forecasting models based on machine learning methods which comprise linear regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), gradient boosting, adaBoost, and deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are studied for medium-term electrical load demand forecasting at an aggregated level. Performance metric results of these analyzes are presented in detail. State-of-the-art feature selection models are examined on the dataset and their effects on these forecasting methods are evaluated. Numerical results show that forecasting performance can be significantly improved. These results are validated by the results of other studies on the subject and found to be superior.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has exploded in the past few years, especially after 2015. Much of it is due to the widespread use of GPUs, which has made parallel computing faster, cheaper, and more efficient. Of course, the combination of infinite expansion of storage capacity and sudden explosion of data torrent (big data) also makes image data, text data, transaction data, mapping data comprehensive and massive explosion. The wave of artificial intelligence has swept the world, and many words still plague us: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. Many people do not have a deep understanding of the meaning of these high-frequency words and the relationship behind them. In order to better understand artificial intelligence, this article explains the meaning of these words in the simplest language to clarify the relationship between them, hoping to be helpful to the beginners. Deep learning expands the scope of artificial intelligence by enabling a wide range of applications for machine learning. Deep learning can overwhelmingly accomplish a variety of tasks, making all machine access capabilities available. For more complex applications, many implementations do not have to rely on supercomputing environments and big data. Data is indispensable, but too much data will also lead to overfitting. Algorithms are the key to solving learning problems. Efficient algorithms make artificial intelligence and machine learning less dependent on big data and supercomputer environment. Data, algorithms and computing power (computing speed, space) maintain a dynamic triangle in the implementation of artificial intelligence.",

Although there is a general awareness of the significance of deep learning in learning and teaching among scholars and educators, the majority of existing research is concerned with theoretical discussion of deep learning, with relatively few empirical studies available. From the perspective of Activity Theory, this study discusses the development of students’ deep learning competence in PBL, and explores possible influencing factors. An empirical study was conducted in PBL, which is based on a course offered to first-year English majors in ** university. Data was collected through questionnaires, research journals and semi-structured interviews, and classroom observation. Results show that the students’ deep learning competence has improved significantly after the completion off PBL tasks, with improvement in all the six indicators of deep learning competence. In light of Activity Theory, this study discussed the main factors that affect the development of students’ deep learning competence in PBL.",

        "abstract": "Sarcasm is an expression of emotion, which often expresses criticism and disgust in a positive tone, and we see it everywhere on social networking platforms. Because of this nature, sarcasm can be challenging to process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) Systems. Failing to detect sarcasm correctly can negatively affect the results of natural language processing tasks such as text correct and sentiment analysis. In recent years, there are more and more studies on sarcasm detection, and the research methods are diverse. According to the survey, the methods based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) account for the majority. Therefore, this paper mainly summarizes the literature on sarcasm detection based on ML and DL methods in recent years. This paper first introduces the application of sarcasm, then expounds the general architecture of sarcasm detection and makes a distinction between machine learning and deep learning. Then the author investigates the relevant literature and compares the results. Finally, the challenges and research directions in this field are summarized. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate the follow-up research of sarcasm detection.",

        "abstract": "The fabrication of extremely life like spoof films and pictures that are getting harder to tell apart from actual content is now possible because to the quick advancement of deep fake technology. A number of industries, including cybersecurity, politics, and journalism, are greatly impacted by the widespread use of deepfakes, which seriously jeopardizes the accuracy of digital media. In computer vision, machine learning, and digital forensics, detecting deepfakes has emerged as a crucial topic for study and development. An outline of the most recent cutting-edge methods and difficulties in deep fake detection is given in this abstract. In this article, we go over the fundamental ideas behind deepfake creation and investigate the many approaches used to spot and stop the spread of fake news. Methods include sophisticated machine learning algorithms trained on enormous datasets of real and fake media, as well as conventional forensic investigation.  We explore the principal characteristics and artifacts that differentiate authentic video from deepfakes, such as disparities in audio-visual synchronization, aberrant eye movements, and inconsistent facial emotions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), two deep learning frameworks, have been used by researchers to create sophisticated detection models that can recognize minute modifications in multimedia information. The fast developments in deep fake generating techniques,  however, continue to exceed efforts in detection and mitigation, making deep fake detection a daunting problem. The issue is made worse by the democratization of deepfake technology and its accessibility to non-experts, which calls for creative solutions and multidisciplinary cooperation to counter this expanding danger.

        "abstract": "Applications of machine learning in seismology have greatly improved our capability of detecting earthquakes in large seismic data archives. Most of these efforts have been focused on continental shallow earthquakes, but here we introduce an integrated deep-learning-based workflow to detect deep earthquakes recorded by a temporary array of ocean-bottom seismographs (OBSs) and land-based stations in the Tonga subduction zone. We develop a new phase picker, PhaseNet-TF, to detect and pick P- and S-wave arrivals in the time-frequency domain. The frequency-domain information is critical for analyzing OBS data, particularly the horizontal components, because they are contaminated by signals of ocean-bottom currents and other noise sources in certain frequency bands. PhaseNet-TF shows a much better performance in picking S waves compared to its predecessor PhaseNet. The predicted phases are associated using an improved Gaussian Mixture Model Associator GaMMA-1D and then relocated with a double-difference package teletomoDD. We further enhance the model performance with a semi-supervised learning approach by iteratively refining labelled data and retraining PhaseNet-TF. This approach effectively suppresses false picks and significantly improves the detection of small earthquakes. The new catalogue of Tonga deep earthquakes contains more than 10 times more events compared to the reference catalogue that was analyzed manually. This deep-learning-enhanced catalogue reveals Tonga seismicity in unprecedented detail, and better defines the lateral extent of the double-seismic zone at intermediate depths and the location of 4 large deep-focus earthquakes relative to background seismicity. It also offers new potential for deciphering deep earthquake mechanisms, refining tomographic models, and understanding of subduction processes.",

DNNs with depthsbetween 4 and 15 layers were trained to predict azimuth direction of targetspeech in 72 directional bins of width 5 degree, embedded in an isotropic,multi-speech-source noise field. Several system parameters were varied, inparticular number of microphones in the bilateral hearing aid scenario wasset to 2, 4, and 6, respectively.\r\nResults show that DNNs provide a clear improvement inlocalization performance over a linear classifier reference system.Increasing the number of microphones from 2 to 4 results in a larger increase ofperformance for the DNNs than for the linear system. However, 6 microphonesprovide only a small additional gain. The DNN architectures perform betterwith 4 microphones than the linear approach does with 6 microphones, thusindicating that location-specific information in source-interference scenariosis encoded non-linearly in the sound field.",

However, people at times have to go through unwanted side effects of the vaccinations which might often cause serious illness. Therefore, modern techniques are to be utilised for safe implementations of vaccines. In this research, Gated Recurrent Unit, GRU, which is a form of Recurrent Neural Network is used to predict whether a particular vaccine will have any side effect on a particular patient.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPlants are valued for their practical purposes (food, medicine, etc.) and are thus considered indispensable. Diseases that attack the plant's leaves might strike at any time among plantings, wreaking havoc on the crop and its economic value. Consequently, the ability to recognize leaf diseases is extremely important in the agricultural sector. Nonetheless, it calls for a lot of work, additional time for planning, and an in-depth understanding of plant pathogens. Both “deep learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML)” algorithms for diagnosing leaf diseases have been created and evaluated by several researchers, with generally favorable results for both categories of techniques. However, they still have certain issues when it comes to covering large regions to detect leaf diseases. We offer a new method for disease prediction in leaves, which we name Multi-Gradient Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Adaptive Support Vector Machine (M-D-C-A-S). We were able to cover he largest area with the greatest accuracy, and our technique outperformed other more conventional approaches. To evaluate the efficacy of the prediction of leaf diseases, a variety of measures are used, like accuracy, precision, f1-score, and recall. Experiments that predicted plant leaf diseases demonstrated the viability and efficacy of our technique.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is the widest spreading disease among women globally. The prevalence rate of breast cancer continued to rise in the last few decades. The mitotic count is a relevant factor for grading invasive breast cancer. Early analysis is an extremely imperative step in treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several skepticisms in detection which employ mammograms. Since it is subject to human prone error, requires more time for completion and the nuclei look similar during all stages of mitosis, automatic detection of mitosis is a good solution to overcome these problems. Detailed analysis of breast cancer normally requires medical images of different methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis largely depend on the experiences of the radiologists, and uncertain diagnosis is quite frequent because of resolution limitations and the concerns of lawsuits arisen from wrong diagnosis or undetected lesions. In this paper, the top methodologies used for mitosis detection are analyzed. There are many algorithms for classification and prediction of breast cancer: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (CART), k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Bayesian Networks (BN). The Wisconsin data set was used to\nanalyze breast cancer as a training set to assess and measure the performance of the three ML classifiers in terms of key frameworks such as accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC. The outcome obtained in this paper provides a critique of the stateofart ML techniques for breast cancer detection. It was also found that the ensemble classifier gives better performance. A preliminary experiment conducted on cascaded RF and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) results in better accuracy than individual classifiers. The paper shows how we can use deep learning technology diagnosis of breast cancer using MIAS Dataset. A deep learning approach is almost used for immense task objective Image processing, Computer Vision, Medical Diagnosis, and Neural Language Processing.",
