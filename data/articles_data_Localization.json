        "abstract": "This chapter looks at the active orientation mechanisms developed by some animals. The chapter focuses on echolocation, a mechanism to negotiate an animal's surroundings based on the emission of sound, its reflection by objects located within the emission beam, and the analysis of the returning echo. Echolocation has been found in bats, toothed whales, and oilbirds. The chapter revisits the beginning of echolocation research at the end of the eighteenth century when several scientists conducted a series of experiments on how bats orient in the dark. It describes the two major categories of sounds produced by bats: frequency-modulated (FM) signals which are used to estimate the distance of the bat from an object, and constant-frequency (CF) signals which are well suited for the so-called Doppler shift analysis. Lastly, the chapter discusses the adaptations developed by some insects to counteract bat echolocation.",

        "abstract": "AbstractOver the last decades, super-resolution techniques have revolutionized the field of fluorescence microscopy. Among them, interferometric or 4Pi microscopy methods exhibit supreme resolving power in the axial dimension. Combining with single-molecule detection/localization and adaptive optics, iPALM/4PiSMS/W-4PiSMSN allowed 10-15 nm isotropic 3D resolution throughout the whole cell. However, further improving the achieved 3D resolution poses significantly challenges which, in part, is blocked by the complexity of single-molecule emission pattern generated by these systems rendering a large portion of information carrying photons unusable. Here we introduce a localization algorithm that achieves the theoretical information limit for 4Pi based single-molecule switching nanoscopy (4Pi-SMSN), and demonstrates improvements in resolution, accuracy as well as applicability comparing with the state of art 4Pi-SMSN methods. Further, with a novel 4Pi-compatible light-sheet illumination reducing the fluorescence background by >5-fold, we demonstrated the new system enables further improvement in the achievable resolution of 4Pi/interferometric single-molecule imaging systems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractUltrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an emerging vascular imaging technique that overcomes the resolution-penetration compromise of ultrasound imaging. Accurate and robust microbubble (MB) localization is essential for successful ULM. In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)- based localization technique that uses both Field-II simulation and in vivo chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) data for training. Both radiofrequency (RF) and in-phase quadrature (IQ) data were tested in this study. The simulation experiment shows that the proposed DL-based localization was able to reduce both missing MB localization rate and MB localization error. In general, RF data showed better performance than IQ. For the in vivo CAM study with high MB concentration, DL-based localization was able to reduce the vessel MB saturation time by more than 50% as compared to conventional localization. Additionally, we propose a DL-based framework for real-time visualization of the high-resolution microvasculature. The findings of the paper support the use of DL for more robust and faster MB localization, especially under high MB concentrations. The results indicate that further improvement could be achieved by incorporating temporal information of the MB data.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor-based indoor global localization system integrating visual localization aided by CNN-based image retrieval with a probabilistic localization approach. The global localization system consists of three parts: coarse place recognition, fine localization and re-localization from kidnapping. Coarse place recognition exploits a monocular camera to realize the initial localization based on image retrieval, in which off-the-shelf features extracted from a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are adopted to determine the candidate locations of the robot. In the fine localization, a laser range finder is equipped to estimate the accurate pose of a mobile robot by means of an adaptive Monte Carlo localization, in which the candidate locations obtained by image retrieval are considered as seeds for initial random sampling. Additionally, to address the problem of robot kidnapping, we present a closed-loop localization mechanism to monitor the state of the robot in real time and make adaptive adjustments when the robot is kidnapped. The closed-loop mechanism effectively exploits the correlation of image sequences to realize the re-localization based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results indicate that the proposed method not only exhibits great improvement on accuracy and speed, but also can recover from localization failures compared to two conventional localization methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nClinical research using human participants to further medical knowledge has been at the forefront in 2021.\n\t\t\t\t\tClinical research studying the efficacy of treatments can be categorised in two broad categories as ‘observational studies’ or\n\t\t\t\t\t‘clinical trials’. Written from the perspective of a localization project manager at Vitaccess, which conducts global digital\n\t\t\t\t\tresearch for biopharmaceutical companies, this paper discusses five core challenges that impact the localization of such a study\n\t\t\t\t\tlaunched in France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Japan, the UK, the US and Canada, conducted via a smartphone app. The\n\t\t\t\t\tlocalization project manager role provides a bridge between translators, revisers, ethics bodies, authors, legal, and medical\n\t\t\t\t\treviewers, enabling oversight to keep the balance between launching the study globally and enabling each country to have the\n\t\t\t\t\tcontent and structure tailored to their cultural and linguistic expectations through localization.\nThe main challenges in localizing a real-world evidence study is the complexity and volume of ethical, legal, and\n\t\t\t\t\tmedical feedback required for the content of the study, which is further complicated by the need to target different countries and\n\t\t\t\t\tlanguages. Subjectivity and variance in the feedback per country also pose difficulties. International harmonisation of ethical,\n\t\t\t\t\tmedical, and legal reviews of such global studies could streamline the process.",

The equivariant localization formula for a torus action expresses the integral of an equivariantly closed form as a finite sum over the fixed point set.

The chapter describes the equivariant localization formula for a circle action and works out an application to the surface area of a sphere. It also explores some equivariant characteristic classes of a vector bundle. These include the equivariant Euler class, the equivariant Pontrjagin classes, and the equivariant Chern classes.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Rheological models of Earth&amp;#8217;s granitoid mid- to upper crust are commonly based on the physico-chemical properties of the most abundant rock forming minerals quartz and feldspar. However, there is increasing field evidence that deformation in these rocks localizes in ultrafine-grained polymineralic shear zones, which are weaker than any of the end member minerals. Especially at the brittle to viscous transition, the localization and deformation mechanisms, i.e. the role of incipient brittle deformation vs. continuous viscous strain localization, is not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill this gap in knowledge, ultramylonite samples with granitic composition from the Central Aar Granite (Aar Massif, Central Switzerland) were deformed using a Griggs type apparatus. The foliation of the ultramylonitic starting material was oriented 45&amp;#176; to the compression direction, to investigate the influence of grain size and composition on strain localization in the different mylonite bands. Two types of coaxial experiments were conducted at 650&amp;#176;C, and 1.2&amp;#160;GPa confining pressure: A) Discrete fractures were created before the shear deformation starts; B) No fractures were induced during an early stage of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All experiments have in common that strain is accommodated in 20-100&amp;#160;&amp;#181;m wide viscous shear zones with elongated grains and minor grain size reduction. In these shear zones, most strain is further localized in 10-20&amp;#160;&amp;#181;m wide zones, showing dramatic grain size reduction down to few tens of nanometres. In the experimentally generated shear zones, both, brittle and viscous processes are active. In terms of overall rock strength, all newly formed ultrafine-grained shear zones are up to three times weaker than comparable experiments on pure quartz or coarser grained granites &amp;#8211; which agrees well with field observations. Furthermore, pre-fractured type A) is up to two times weaker than the non-fractured type B), and the orientation and number of shear zones is also fundamentally different between the two experiment types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study confirms two weakening factors promoting different types of strain localization at the brittle to viscous transition: 1) The existence of fractures and their interconnectivity &amp;#8211; facilitating highly-localized grain size reduction; 2) Initial sample heterogeneity by polymineralic composition and ultrafine grain size &amp;#8211; generating grain size reduction along strain gradients by activating viscous processes. Further quantitative microstructural analyses will reveal the role of chemistry and the deformation mechanisms on the localization behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground:\nThe number of patients with non-palpable breast lesions has increased gradually. This is because of the technological development in imaging techniques and the screening programs that lead to early detection of breast lesions.\nThe aim of marking the non-palpable breast lesions is to achieve accurate lesion localization, to obtain the better cosmetic result with less tissue loss and to provide negative surgical margin.\nAim:the aim of the study is to compare the wire-guided localization (WGL) technique with the radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) technique to assess their accuracy and efficacy in non-palpable breast lesions localization.\nMethods:From January 2018 and June2022 a total of 670 patients underwent an excision for non-palpable lesions were enrolled randomly in ROLL group (n = 320 ) and WGL (n =350 ) at Baheya center for Early Detection and Treatment of Breast Cancer.\nResults: There were no differences between the two groups in terms of age, localization technique.Both the localization time and the time of operation were decreased with the ROLL. Complete lesion excision with clear margins were reported in (88.2%) of ROLL patients and in (81.8%) of WGL patients. Reoperations were done as a second operation on16( 11.8%)of ROLL patients and on 29( 18.2%) of WGL patients.\nConclusion:This study shows that ROLL is as effective as WGL for non-palpable breast lesions excision. Also, ROLL improve the outcomes by decreasing the duration of surgery, localization time,achieving a higher percentage of clear margin in spite of lower specimen size and scar length.",

The Hennaton was a monastic center of Byzantine and medieval Egypt, one that attracted pilgrims and believers from Egypt and the whole world. However, the only surviving traces of its existence today are artistic depictions vouching for what once was a grand existence. Its prestigious reputation inspired kings to leave behind their earthly kingdoms, attracted pilgrims from all over the world, drew native Egyptians into the ascetic life, and finally, produced both patriarchs and saints whose memory is immortalized in the history of the Coptic Orthodox Church.",

        "abstract": "In underwater localization systems several sources of error may impact in different ways the accuracy of the final position estimates. Through simulations and statistical analysis it is possible to identify and characterize such sources of error and their relative importance. This is especially of use when an accurate localization system has to be designed within required accuracy prescriptions. This approach allows one to also investigate how much these sources of error influence the final position estimates achieved by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). This paper presents the results of experiments designed in a virtual environment used to simulate real acoustic underwater localization systems. The paper intends to analyze the main parameters that significantly influence the position estimates achieved by a Short Baseline (SBL) system. Specifically, the results of this analysis are presented for a proprietary localization system constituted by a surface platform equipped with four acoustic transducers used for the localization of an underwater target. The simulator here presented has the purpose of simulating the hardware system and modifying some of its design parameters, such as the base-line length and the errors on the GPS and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) units, in order to understand which parameters have to modify for improving the accuracy of the entire positioning system. It is shown that statistical analysis techniques can be of help in determining the best values of these parameters that permit to improve the performance of a real hardware system.",
