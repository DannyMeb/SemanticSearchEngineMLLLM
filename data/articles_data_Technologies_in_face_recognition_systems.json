        "abstract": "The article is dedicated to the investigation of face identification methods and aims to determine the most suitable one for a security system based on facial recognition from surveillance cameras. The time costs of these methods and their robustness against geometric scale distortions and rotations in various planes have been analyzed. Custom datasets have been generated for experimentation purposes. Special attention has been given to striking a balance between the speed and accuracy of the examined methods for their utilization as the initial stage of a security system based on facial recognition in a video stream. The conducted research has revealed that the most effective methods are RetinaFace-MobileNet0.25, FaceBoxes, SCRFD500MF, and CenterFace; RetinaFaceResNet125, DSFD, and RetinaFaceMobile0.25 which are resilient to facial rotations. Furthermore, when selecting the most optimal facial recognition method for application within a security system, the presence of informative facial parameters was taken into account, as well as the fact that the recognition methods used in the subsequent stage have their limitations concerning resilience to affine transformations.",

Özellikle derin öğrenme ağ mimari yapılarından biri olan evrişimsel sinir ağları (Convolutional Neural Network-CNN), yüz tanıma çalışmalarında büyük başarılar sağlamaktadır. Bu başarılar da veri setlerinin büyüklüğü önemli rol oynamaktadır. Özellikle kullanılan veri setlerindeki yetersizlik başarı oranlarını etkileyebilmektedir. Bunun önüne geçmek için ise veri tipine göre değişik veri artırma teknikleri uygulanmaktadır. Yapılan bu çalışmada yüz tanımlama problemi için derin öğrenmeye dayalı adaptif bir yüz tanıma modeli (AYTM) geliştirildi. Geliştirilen bu model kontrast sınırlı uyarlanabilir histogram eşitleme (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization-CLAHE), CNN ve çok katmanlı algılayıcı (Multi Layer Perceptron-MLP)’ndan oluşmaktadır. İki farklı veri seti grubu kullanılarak geliştirilen modelin performans değerlendirilmesi yapılmıştır. Özellikle veri artırma işleminin model başarısını ciddi oranda artırdığı gözlendi ve veri artırma işleminin derin öğrenme uygulamalarında gerekliliği vurgulanmıştır.",

        "abstract": "Due to its simplicity, face authentication is currently more frequently used than authentication using a personal identification number or an unlock pattern, especially on mobile devices. This has made it a seductive target for attackers who use a demonstration assault. Traditional presentation attacks employ the victim's face or victim footage. The existence of master faces—faces that match numerous enrolled templates in face recognition systems—has been demonstrated in earlier research, and their presence increases the effectiveness of presentation attacks. In this article, we present the results of a thorough investigation of latent variable evolution (LVE), a technique frequently employed to produce master faces. To determine the characteristics of master faces, an LVE algorithm was used in a variety of settings and with many databases and/or face recognition systems.",

        "abstract": "Compared to the traditional sparse representation and the dictionary processing method of occlusion, deep learning-based face recognition methods are being used more and more widely in the field of face recognition. However, in practice, face recognition results are greatly influenced by light intensity, shooting Angle, mask and sunglasses occlusion and other factors. Therefore, this paper will discuss the face recognition under the occlusion situation. In order to solve the problem of large pose change of human face and local occlusion respectively, an offset network and a weight network was introduced into the convolutional neural network. In the following paper, the facial recognition accuracy of the introduction of the offset network, the facial recognition accuracy of the weight network and the recognition accuracy of the unification of the two are compared with the traditional facial recognition model VGG16.",

The software used for building facial recognition algorithms is Python and OpenCV. \"Attendance using Face Recognition\" is a method for tracking and managing attendance that makes use of facial recognition technology. By seamlessly integrating the 'Face Recognition' module, a native Python feature, and the OpenCV library, our system excels in accuracy and dependability. The system then stores attendance records in a database and provides real-time reports. In this article, we demonstrate how to create a face recognition system in Python utilizing the built-in \"Face Recognition\" module and the OpenCV library. Our results show that our system achieves high accuracy and robustness while being efficient and scalable, catering to a wide spectrum of educational institutions, organizations, and enterprises.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAging is a complex process that affects both the shape and texture of a face. In the aging domain, various methods have been proposed for age estimation or simulation of the face based on an image at a given age. Face recognition methods that are designed for automatic face recognition are still a challenging issue. We present a novel age invariant face recognition method using tensor subspace learning with fuzzy synthetic classification. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) processed face images are used to learn the tensor sub‐space, which converts high dimensional feature space to age‐invariants while retaining key elements of the local geometrical structure of the face. Tensor sub‐space is better in terms of sub‐space learning and feature extraction than Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) that been used in many techniques in the literature. Tensor Normalized Face images are generated which exhibit maximum inter‐class distances and minimum intra‐class distances. Further local patches are used for synthesizing global Fuzzy membership scores to classify the test face images. Experiments performed on standard face‐aging datasets, namely FG‐NET, AGEDB, and MORPH‐Album‐II, and received accuracy of 99.15%, 99.20%, and 99.8%, respectively. Experimental results outperform the current state‐of‐the‐art techniques, and results show the promise of the proposed system for personal identification despite the aging process. It also proved that the local descriptor gives better performance over the global descriptor like PCA for the aging process. The method also demonstrated improved performance as compared with compute‐intensive methods that required training on deep networks.",

        "abstract": "The face Recognition technique is important in Computer Vision nowadays. The research study focuses on a Face Recognition system that uses deep learning to identify face photos. Face detection and categorization are carried out using various Convolutional neural network (CNN) models using deep learning methods. Prior research has mostly focused on either the ResNet or DenseNet-based CNN models. The current study combines ResNet and DenseNet to create a hybrid model. The suggested work aims to improve efficiency and accuracy. During the simulation's training and testing phases, categories are taken into account. The present study is centered on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The photos go through an initial noise reduction procedure. Picture quality assessment involves considering measures like MSE, PSNR, and SSIM. Once the suggested model has completed training, it produces high-quality images. The suggested system includes the Innovative CNN approach framework, which combines DenseNet with a noise reduction approach, a segmentation mechanism, and a ResNet model based on CNN. Comparative research was performed to assess the precision of several filtered image collections using different convolutional neural network models. The simulation results show that the proposed model had higher performance and accuracy than traditional ResNet and DenseNet models.\r\n ",

        "abstract": "The complex and diverse background conditions, the variability of human face and the artificial deliberate transformation have all become the problems that traditional face recognition technology can't solve, and they can't really reflect the imperceptible advantages of face recognition. After wearing masks, the most important mouth and nose areas of human face are covered by these masks with different shapes and colors, and some facial features are hidden, and the key feature points that can be extracted are greatly reduced. In this paper, the existing mask region repair algorithms at home and abroad are classified and summarized, mainly including mask occlusion face recognition based on robust occlusion, mask occlusion face recognition based on sparse representation classification and mask occlusion face recognition based on neural network. It is pointed out that partial occlusion is one of the main difficulties. The main methods and shortcomings of face recognition based on mask region repair algorithm are systematically analyzed and summarized, and the main problems and possible research ways in the future are analyzed.",

There are many security technologies that was developed to keep user information save. for example, there are several technologies used to let just the accurate user to log into devices like fingerprint, face recognition, or any another type of these systems. These technologies are in continuous development and are still suffering from accuracy, so several studies were performed to get the best accuracy for any of these systems.\nComputer vision was developed to give the devices the ability to see and recognize objects in an image or a video scene. It is a science that aims to build an intelligent application that are able to understand the content inside images as humans can do. To create a system like this, first step is to make Data acquisition, this task is done by cameras which gives us a sequence of frames when we record a video. After that, this data is analyzed and studied to extract important features from it. This feature will allow us to re- construct the description of the outer world in a manner that can understood by computer system.\nFace recognition systems are used on a wide range in mobile applications, banks, and military sites, police stations to make a recognition of the criminals, even in covid19 situations the face recognition was used too.\nOur proposed method aims to increase the accuracy a face recognition system using deep learning models, the system proposed is able to work on any platform compiled with python which is the application was used in our study. The model performed gives a high accuracy with a very speed result.\n\n\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the application of intelligent devices in the network is becoming more and more extensive, and the monitoring technology is gradually developing towards the direction of intelligence and digitization. As a hot topic in the field of computer vision, face recognition faces problems such as low level of intelligence and long processing time. Therefore, under the technical support of the IoTs, the research uses internet protocol cameras to collect face information, improves the principal component analysis (PCA), poses a PLV algorithm, and then applies it to the face recognition system for remote monitoring. The outcomes demonstrate that in the Olivetti Research Laboratory face database, the accuracy of PLV is relatively stable, and the highest and lowest are 98 and 94%, respectively. In Yale testing, the accuracy of this algorithm is 12% higher than that of PCA algorithm; In the database of Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), the PLV algorithm requires a time range of 0.2–0.3 seconds and has high operational efficiency. In the selected remote monitoring face database, the accuracy of the method is stable at more than 90%, with the highest being 98%, indicating that it can effectively improve the accuracy of face recognition and provide a reference technical means for further optimization of the remote monitoring system.",

The Speech.dll library was used to control voice commands and the EmguCV libraries for face recognition. The application was developed in C # programming language. In this application, a security system with a very controlled structure was developed due to the importance of security systems. With the developed application, any high-security operation can be carried out anywhere with computer control. In the developed application, a method with two controls was proposed to provide security control of any system.\n\n",

        "abstract": "In computer vision, we must handle with the various structural aspects of image or video data. The texture is one of the most important aspects of this type of data, which is utilised to identify objects or regions of interest in an image. As imaging conditions change, textures inside actual images significantly change in brightness, contrast, size, and skew. To recognise textures in real-world images, a similarity measure that is invariant to these features must be used. Existing recognition techniques did not perform well due to issues such as illumination, scale, and subject rotation. To address this issue, invariant feature representation methods are being developed to generate features that are insensitive to such variations. In this paper, we proposed a robust hybrid feature descriptor and predicted the faces under illumination, scale, and pose variations using an optimum multi-kernel support vector machine. Additionally, the suggested robust hybrid feature descriptor is enhanced by combining a hybrid transform composed of discrete wavelet and discrete shearlet transforms with some image statistical textural data. The proposed face recognition system is implemented in MATLAB, and analysed using various parameters to show proposed methods improved performance as compared to the state of the art methods.",

        "abstract": "Unconstrained video face recognition is an extension of face recognition technology, and it is an indispensable part of intelligent security and criminal investigation systems. However, general face recognition technology cannot be directly applied to unconstrained video face recognition, because the video contains fewer frontal face image frames and a single image contains less face feature information. To address the above problems, this work proposes a Feature Map Aggregation Network (FMAN) to achieve unconstrained video face recognition by aggregating multiple face image frames. Specifically, an image group is used as the input of the feature extraction network to replace a single image to obtain a multi-channel feature map group. Then a quality perception module is proposed to obtain quality scores for feature maps and adaptively aggregate image features from image groups at the feature map level. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging face recognition benchmarks YTF, IJB-A and COX to evaluate the proposed method, showing a significant increase in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "In [1] Karanwal et al. introduced the novel color descriptor in Face Recognition (FR) called as Fused Local Color Pattern (FLCP). In FLCP, the RGB color format is utilized for extracting features. From R, G and B channels, the MRELBP-NI, 6 × 6 MB-LBP and RD-LBP are imposed for feature extraction and then all are integrated to form the FLCP size. FLCP beats the accuracy of various methods. The one major shortcoming observed in [1] is that the basic format RGB is used for extracting features. Literature suggests that other hybrid formats achieves better recognition rates than RGB. Motivated from literature, the proposed work uses the hybrid color space format RCrQ for feature extraction. In this format R channel is taken from RGB, Cr channel is taken from YCbCr and Q channel is taken from YIQ. On R channel, MRELBP-NI is imposed for extracting features, On Cr channel 6 × 6 MB-LBP is imposed and on Q channel RD-LBP is imposed for extracting features. Then all channel features are joined to build the robust and discriminant feature called as Robust And Discriminant Local Color Pattern (RADLCP). Compression and matching is assisted from PCA and SVMs. For evaluating results GT face dataset is used. Results proves the potency of RADLCP in contrast to gray scale based implemented descriptors. RADLCP also beats the results of FLCP. Several literature techniques are also outclassed by RADLCP. For evaluating all the results MATLAB R2021a is used.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been proposed to advance the progress of various applications, including face recognition, object detection, pattern recognition, and number plate recognition. The utilization of CNNs in these areas has considerably improved security and surveillance capabilities by providing automated recognition solutions, such as traffic surveillance, access control devices, biometric security systems, and attendance systems. However, there is still room for improvement in this field. This paper discusses several classic CNN models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, as well as lightweight models for mobile-based applications, such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet. Additionally, deep CNN-based face recognition models, such as DeepFace, DeepID, FaceNet, and SphereFace, are explored, along with their architectural characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and recognition accuracy. The results indicate that many scholars are researching lightweight face recognition, but applying it to mobile devices is impractical due to high computational costs. Furthermore, noise label learning is not robust in actual scenarios, and unlabeled face learning is expensive in manual labeling. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion of the current problems faced by face recognition technology and its potential future directions for development. ",

        "abstract": "Distopik anlatılar, yaşanmak istenmeyen toplumlara ve ülkelere dair anlatılar olup amaçları izleyicilere katarsis yaşatarak daha iyi hissetmelerini sağlamak değil, içinde yaşanan toplumlar hakkında eleştirel ve sorgulayıcı olmaya yöneltmektir. Gözetim toplumuna dayalı distopyaların ele alındığı sinema filmlerine ait akademik incelemelere sıkça rastlanmaktadır; fakat gözetim toplumuna dayalı distopik anlatı animasyonları konusunda yapılmış akademik inceleme yok denecek kadar azdır. Bu çalışma animasyonda gözetim toplumuna dayalı distopyanın nasıl resmedildiğini ve distopik eleştirelliğin nasıl kurgulandığını araştırmayı amaçlar. Çalışmada Sovyetler Birliği döneminde Estonya’da yaşamış olan animatör Martinus Klemet’in Face Recognition adlı distopik kısa animasyon filmi incelenmiştir. Öncelikle gözetim toplumu ile ilgili alanyazındaki sosyolojik kuramlar ve kavramlar ortaya konmuş, ardından gözetim toplumuna dayalı distopya filmleri hakkında yapılmış incelemeler ele alınmıştır. Face Recognition filminin analizi için görsel, işitsel ve tematik ögelerin analizine dayanan filmsel metin analizi kullanılmıştır. Analiz bulgularına bakıldığında Face Recognition filminin süperpanoptik*** evreninde özel ve kamusal alanlarda yer alan gözetleme kameraları, bireylerin kişisel bilgilerinin depolandığı veri tabanları, 2D animasyon ile pixel art gibi farklı animasyon tekniklerinin bir arada kullanılması, dijitalize edilmiş ses ve görüntüler, müstesna kadavra gibi sürreal bir teknik ile hem gözetleme toplumunun farklı yönleri ortaya konulmuş hem de seyircinin yabancılaştırılması ve uyarılması ile distopyanın eleştirelliği vurgulanmıştır. Sonuç olarak animasyonda gerek distopik anlatının tasarımı, gerekse distopik eleştirelliğin kurgulanması için görsel, işitsel, tematik ve yapısal olmak üzere faydalanılabilecek çok sayıda öge bulunduğu ifade edilebilir.",

However, it is imperative to comprehend how these systems perform under real-world conditions, specifically when confronted with degraded images. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of image degradation on facial recognition systems that rely on deep neural networks. The study evaluates three facial detection algorithms and eight facial recognition algorithms, with experiments conducted on four diverse datasets. A total of 14 types of image degradations, encompassing pure and mixed variations, were employed at six different intensity levels. Three distinct types of image pairs were generated to encompass various scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to enhance the understanding and assessment of facial recognition system outcomes, thereby strengthening the overall analysis of these systems. On average, the models had a minimum impact of 17% and a maximum of 43% for the datasets used in the experiment.",

        "abstract": "Advancing in variable scopes in network technology, many new technologies were developed. Security issues were important, especially in the detection and recognition of people using variable methods like face details. Sensors have been used widely in recent days to support security systems. Sensors are devices used to convert any type of signals into electrical signals that are recorded to be processed later. These signals can be viewed by the user in several ways. Sensors increased in the development stage that can be integrated with operating systems, data storage systems, processing units, communication units, and any other function units. Detection and recognition systems were developed into a new level of technology. Some systems like figure print and palm lines face many problems because the possible change of the skin structure can be faced in time. So, these methods faced a certain problem and limitations that caused them to search for other methods more accurate. This search aims to create a new method for face detection and recognition depending on sensors. Most of the methods used for face recognition depend on OpenCV libraries that give good accuracy and time recovery availability. On the other hand, practical applications were developed to increase the accuracy of these systems like SeetaFace and YouTu methods. Three methods of detection were important to be detected too to increase the accuracy of the whole system which are the side face detection, the occlusion detection, and the face expressions. Then these data were compared to create the whole accuracy result of the system.",

This article analyses the threats that the development and use of facial recognition technologies pose to privacy and personal data protection. It discusses the concept of privacy and the protection of personal data, including biometric data, at European Union level, and assesses the proposed new legal framework. It questions whether this is sufficient to protect privacy and ensure personal data protection in the context of the rapid development and increasing usage of facial recognition technologies in public and private sectors.",

        "abstract": "Biometrics are one of the most privacy-sensitive data. Ubiquitous authentication systems with a focus on privacy favor decentralized approaches as they reduce potential attack vectors, both on a technical and organizational level. The gold standard is to let the user be in control of where their own data is stored, which consequently leads to a high variety of devices used. Moreover, in comparison with a centralized system, designs with higher end-user freedom often incur additional network overhead. Therefore, when using face recognition for biometric authentication, an efficient way to compare faces is important in practical deployments, because it reduces both network and hardware requirements that are essential to encourage device diversity. This paper proposes an efficient way to aggregate embeddings used for face recognition based on an extensive analysis on different datasets and the use of different aggregation strategies. As part of this analysis, a new dataset has been collected, which is available for research purposes. Our proposed method supports the construction of massively scalable, decentralized face recognition systems with a focus on both privacy and long-term usability.",
