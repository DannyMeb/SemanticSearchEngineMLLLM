The comparison considered performance measures such as the area under the curve (AUC), F-score, precision, and confusion matrix. The paper evaluated the performance of eight supervised learning algorithms for email spam detection. The first stage collected the dataset of emails from the Kaggle repository. The second stage involves pre-processing, duplicate removal, and the dataset features scaling. After the pre-processing stage, the study employed a synthetic minority technique for balancing samples representing the spam and no spam emails in the dataset. In the final stage, the supervised learning algorithms are trained on the pre-processed dataset and then the test result is analyzed. The comparison shows the random forest (RF) model performing at higher accuracy than the other models. The RG model achieved 96.6% accuracy in email spam detection. Thus, the result demonstrates that different models tend to perform differently in email spam detection.",

The great performance of machine learning algorithms into several fields provided the humans with opportunities to tackle some of their hard jobs to be handled by machine learning systems. These tasks seem effortless for machines, and need less time as the amount of texts or spams need to be classified is huge. Hence, in his paper, we propose three different models for the task of emails spam detection. The three models are trained and validated on a public spam dataset. Experimentally, the models performed differently and it was seen that the Na√Øve Bayes outperformed the other machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.",

        "abstract": "Despite the great advances in spam detection, spam remains a major problem that has affected the global economy enormously. Spam attacks are popularly perpetrated through different digital platforms with a large electronic audience, such as emails, microblogging websites (e.g. Twitter), social networks (e.g. Facebook), and review sites (e.g. Amazon). Different spam detection solutions have been proposed in the literature, however, Machine Learning (ML) based solutions are one of the most effective. Nevertheless, most ML algorithms have computational complexity problem, thus some studies introduced Nature Inspired (NI) algorithms to further improve the speed and generalization performance of ML algorithms. This study presents a survey of recent ML-based and NI-based spam detection techniques to empower the research community with information that is suitable for designing effective spam filtering systems for emails, social networks, microblogging, and review websites. The recent success and prevalence of deep learning show that it can be used to solve spam detection problems. Moreover, the availability of large-scale spam datasets makes deep learning and big data solutions (such as Mahout) very suitable for spam detection. Few studies explored deep learning algorithms and big data solutions for spam detection. Besides, most of the datasets used in the literature are either small or synthetically created. Therefore, future studies can consider exploring big data solutions, big datasets, and deep learning algorithms for building efficient spam detection techniques.",

        "abstract": "Unsolicited emails, popularly referred to as spam, have remained one of the biggest threats to cybersecurity globally. More than half of the emails sent in 2021 were spam, resulting in huge financial losses. The tenacity and perpetual presence of the adversary, the spammer, has necessitated the need for improved efforts at filtering spam. This study, therefore, developed baseline models of random forest and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) ensemble algorithms for the detection and classification of spam emails using the Enron1 dataset. The developed ensemble models were then optimized using the grid-search cross-validation technique to search the hyperparameter space for optimal hyperparameter values. The performance of the baseline (un-tuned) and the tuned models of both algorithms were evaluated and compared. The impact of hyperparameter tuning on both models was also examined. The findings of the experimental study revealed that the hyperparameter tuning improved the performance of both models when compared with the baseline models. The tuned RF and XGBoost models achieved an accuracy of 97.78% and 98.09%, a sensitivity of 98.44% and 98.84%, and an F1 score of 97.85% and 98.16%, respectively. The XGBoost model outperformed the random forest model. The developed XGBoost model is effective and efficient for spam email detection.",

In addition, the problem of SMS spam detection was addressed as a clustering analysis that requires a metaheuristic algorithm to find the clustering structures. Three differential evolution variants viz DE/rand/1, jDE/rand/1, jDE/best/1, are adopted for solving the SMS spam problem. Experimental results illustrate that the jDE/best/1 produces best results over other variants in terms of accuracy, false-positive rate and false-negative rate.

But this practice overlooks important sources of variability resulting in potentially misleading estimates and may conflate response bias with participants‚Äô underlying sensitivity to detect lies from truths. We offer an alternative approach using Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models (BGLMMs) within a Signal Detection Theory (SDT) framework to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates individual differences from both judges and senders, which are a principal source of spurious findings in deception research. By avoiding data transformations and aggregations, this methodology outperforms traditional methods and provides more informative and reliable effect estimates. The proposed framework offers researchers a powerful tool for analyzing deception data and advances our understanding of veracity judgments. All code and data are openly available.",

        "abstract": "The spam filtering system is used to identify which emails in the received emails are completely meaningless to the recipient and perform operations such as interception and deletion. Nowadays, with the rapid development of the Internet, while e-mail provides convenience for people, spam also comes along with it, which brings many troubles to users. According to statistics, 80% of the emails in the world are spam, and e-spam is really annoying. Therefore, how to solve the problem of filtering emails has important practical significance. Spam filtering using Bayesian theory is a statistical technique applied to email filtering. It essentially uses Bayesian classification to discriminate the attributes of emails, including spam and non-spam. Bayesian-based spam filtering is a very effective technique that can modify the model to meet the needs of specific users and give a lower spam detection rate that is acceptable to users. In this experiment, we use Naive Bayes for experiments, and we use Unigram and bigram methods to preprocess the data, respectively. Finally, it is concluded that the data processing accuracy of unigram and bigram is greater than 0.75, and bigram performs better in four different evaluation indicators.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of digital technologies as an integral part of today‚Äôs everyday life, the risk of information security breaches is increasing. Email spam, commonly known as junk email, continues to pose a significant challenge in the digital realm, inundating inboxes with unsolicited and often irrelevant messages. This relentless influx of spam not only disrupts user productivity but also raises security concerns, as it frequently serves as a vehicle for phishing attempts, malware distribution, and other cyber threats. The prevalence of spam is fueled by its low-cost dissemination and its ability to reach a wide audience, exploiting vulnerabilities in email systems. This paper marks the inception of an in-depth investigation into the viability and potential implementation of a robust spam filtering and prevention system tailored explicitly to university networks. With the escalating threat of email-based hacking attacks and the incessant deluge of spam, the need for a comprehensive and effective defense mechanism within academic institutions becomes increasingly imperative. In exploring potential solutions, this study delves into the applicability and efficacy of Bayesian filters, a class of probabilistic classifiers renowned for their aptitude in distinguishing between legitimate emails and spam messages. Bayesian filters utilize statistical algorithms to analyze email content, learning patterns and features to accurately categorize incoming emails.",

        "abstract": "Signal detection theory (SDT) is an important tool for research in psychology and neuroscience. Estimating sensitivity (d‚Äô) and bias (c) of responses to stimuli is at the heart of a wide range of experimental domains. In the present work, we investigate a conventional Bayesian SDT model and incrementally build upon it to improve the model‚Äôs capacity to render precise estimates of sensitivity, bias, hit rate, false alarm rate, and correlation between sensitivity and bias. To test these models, we simulate responses from 100 participants to an oddball task with 25 targets and 75 foils. We simulate a high sensitivity group (d'‚âÖ2¬±0.5, c‚âÖ0.1¬±0.5), and a low accuracy group (d'‚âÖ1¬±0.5, c‚âÖ0.5¬±0.5). We test three variations of the model, one with fixed parameters, a second with varying parameters, and a third with multivariate varying parameters with Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe (LKJ) correlation priors. The models are assessed progressively via prior predictive checks, precision analysis, convergence checks, posterior assessment via similarity measures, posterior predictive checks, and model comparison. Results indicate that a basic/base model improves precision with increased sample size but does not improve accuracy of estimates. A model with adaptive priors (i.e. multilevel a.k.a. hierarchical) solves this problem, but cannot provide information about parameters‚Äô correlations. A third model with LKJ priors performs similarly well and provides correlations. These outcomes exemplify the capacity of a gradual model design Bayesian approach to examine theoretical assumptions and provide more informative model outputs.",

        "abstract": "Email spam is an unwanted bulk message that is sent to a recipient‚Äôs email address without explicit consent from the recipient. This is usually considered a means of advertising and maximizing profit, especially with the increase in the usage of the internet for social networking, but can also be very frustrating and annoying to the recipients of these messages. Recent research has shown that about 14.7 billion spam messages are sent out every single day of which more than 45% of these messages are promotional sales content that the recipient did not specifically opt-in. This has gotten the attention of many researchers in the area of natural language processing. In this paper, we used the Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) for classification tasks between spam and Ham messages. The performance of LSTM is compared with that of a Recurrent Neural Network( RNN) which can also be used for a classification task of this nature but suffers from short-time memory and tends to leave out important information from earlier time steps to later ones in terms of prediction. The evaluation of the result shows that LSTM achieved 97% accuracy with both Adams and RMSprop optimizers compared to RNN with an accuracy of 94% with RMSprop and 87% accuracy with Adams optimizer.",

The corporation has to assess market reactions towards its goods. However, it is not straightforward to track and organize popular reviews. Many public views are hard to manually process in social media. A methodology is then required to categories positive or negative public assessments automatically. Online feedback will provide customers with an insight into the consistency, efficiency and advice of the product; this provides prospective buyers with a better understanding of the product. One such unrealized opportunity is the usability of web assessments from suppliers in order to fulfill client requirements by evaluating beneficial feedback. Good and negative reviews play a major role in assessing customer needs and in quicker collection of product input from consumers. Sentiment Analysis is a computer study that extracts contextual data from the text. In this study a vast number of online mobile telephone ratings are analyzed.  We classify the text as positive and negative, but we also included feelings of frustration, expectation, disgust, apprehension, happiness, regret, surprise and confidence for spam review detection. This delimited grouping of feedback helps to holistically assess the product, allowing buyers to decide better.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of social networks has caused these platforms to become the target of malicious people. Although social networks have their own spam detection systems, these systems sometimes may not prevent spams in their social networks. Spam contents and messages threaten the security and performance of users of these networks. A spam account detection framework based on three components is proposed in this study. Short link analysis, machine learning and text analysis are the components used together in the proposed framework. First, a dataset was created for this purpose and the attributes of spam accounts were determined. Later, the hyperlinks in the messages in this dataset were analyzed through link analysis component. The machine learning component was modelled through attributes. Moreover, the messages of the social network users were analyzed through text analysis method. A web-based application of the proposed model was put into practice. As a result of the experimental studies carried out thanks to the framework, it was determined that the proposed framework showed a performance of 95.69 %. The success of this article was calculated according to the F-measure and precision evaluation metrics under the influence of sensitive content rate. It is aimed to detect spam accounts on social network and the spam detection policy of these networks is intended to support.",

It is one the major issues in today's internet world. Spam emails contain mostly advertisements and offensive content, which are often sent without the recipient's request and are generally annoying, time consuming, and wasting space on the communication media's resources. It creates inconveniences and financial loss to the recipients. Hence, there is always the need to filter the spam emails and separate them from the legitimate emails. There are a lot of content-based machine learning techniques that have proven to be effective in detecting and filtering spam emails. Due to a large increase in email spamming, the emails are studied and classified as spam or not spam. In this chapter, three machine learning models, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), are used classify the emails as spam and benign. ",

In addition to this dataset, the dataset our collect consists of 1015 images in total. Feature extraction was performed on these images. Obtained features were classified by SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm.

Nevertheless, the rise in email users has occurred a dramatic increase in spam emails in recent years. Processing and managing emails properly for individuals and companies are getting increasingly difficult. This article proposes a novel technique for email spam detection that is based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms. During system training, the network is selectively focused on necessary parts of the email text. The usage of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, abstract, and generalizable features by hierarchical representation is the major contribution of this study. Additionally, this contribution incorporates cross-dataset evaluation, which enables the generation of more independent performance results from the model's training dataset. According to cross-dataset evaluation results, the proposed technique advances the results of the present attention-based techniques by utilizing temporal convolutions, which give us more flexible receptive field sizes are utilized. The suggested technique's findings are compared to those of state-of-the-art models and show that our approach outperforms them.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMany social media platforms have emerged as a result of the online social network's (OSN) rapid expansion. They have become important in day-to-day life, and spammers have turned their attention to them. Spam detection is done in two different ways, such as machine learning (ML) and expert-based detection. The expert-based detection technique‚Äôs accuracy depends on expert knowledge, and the manual process is a time consuming task. Thus, ML-based spam detection is preferred in OSN. Spam identification on social networks is a difficult operation involving a variety of factors, and spam and ham have resulted in an imbalanced data distribution, which gives an advantage to spammers for corrupting our devices. Spam detection based on ML algorithms like Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGB, Voting Classifier (VC), and many other algorithms are used to design the address balance and to attain high assessment accuracy. There is a non-balance issue. Text is vectorized by vectorizers and all the relative results are stored. The experimental result shows that, as compared to KN, NB, ETC, RF, SVC, LR, XGB, and DT, the proposed VC provides a higher classification accuracy rate of 97.96%. The proposed methods are effective in identifying balanced and imbalanced datasets, as evidenced by the validation results. The website was created to detect messages as spam or not.",

        "abstract": "As the popularity of social networking sites continues to increase, spam accounts are also on the rise. Over the past few years, social networking and information-sharing microblogging websites such as Twitter and Sina Weibo have gained popularity. Unsolicited content, such as social spam, has also been exploited by spammers to overwhelm most users unfairly. In contrast to existing work, this paper uses a novel graph-based approach for spam detection. The problem of graph summarization has practical applications involving visualization and graph compression. As graph-structured databases become popular and prominent, summarizing and compressing graph-structured databases can become more and more valuable. Our experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of our proposed strategy. The accuracy of the graph is considered before and after Graph Summarization using MultiNominal NB and then compared with other machine learning algorithms. Various algorithms are considered, and it is found that MultiNominal NB gives the lowest training time and the highest accuracy. The training time of MultiNominal NB is found to be 0.55 sec before graph summarization. After graph summarization, the training time is optimized to be 0.02 seconds, and the accuracy value is 96.64%.¬† ¬†",

        "abstract": "In recent years, social media platforms have experienced a surge in popularity, leading to an increase in spam and spammer communities. This paper presents a comprehensive study on spam detection and spammer community detection in social media platforms using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach focuses on three main features: Review-Behavioral (RB) Based features, Review-Linguistic (RL) Based Features, and User-Behavioral (UB) Based Features. By combining these features, we aim to create a robust and accurate spam detection model that effectively identifies spam content and spammer communities in social media networks. The Review-Behavioral (RB) Based features focus on the patterns and tendencies observed in user-generated content, such as the frequency of posting, the time between posts, and the distribution of ratings. Review-Linguistic (RL) Based Features, on the other hand, analyze the linguistic characteristics of the content, including the use of specific keywords, the complexity of the text, and sentiment analysis. Lastly, User-Behavioral (UB) Based Features examine the behavior of users in the social media platform, including their social connections, interactions, and activity patterns. By incorporating these features into a machine learning model, we aim to develop an effective spam detection and spammer community detection system that can be used to protect social media platforms from malicious activities. The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of these features in identifying spam and spammer communities, as well as contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security and integrity of social media networks.",

About 76% of mobile users received spam messages of Ads, fraud messages and\nphishing links.

Although the operators are making much effort against\nspam message, the number of spams are increasing day by day.\n\n\nAim:\nMany schemes designed to detect and filter spam have been proposed in the research area. The\nBayesian classification algorithm is one of the most popular schemes. Most of the spam detection\nschemes based on Bayesian are designed for communication providers. The scalability of filter policy\nis hard to control because the strict policy might filter the normal messages while some spam\nmessages would not be detected due to the flexibility in the policy.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe current mobile device has a robust computational capability so it can execute complex\njobs. A spam detection framework is designed in the present study.\n\n\nResults:\nIt can sniffer the coming messages in mobile device by hooking the Android SMS API, and\nsend them to the filter module, -which is responsible to filter messages into normal or spam based\non Bayesian classification. This is a light-weight framework of consuming low power, which is suitable\nfor mobile devices.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAn unsolicited means of digital communications in the internet world is the spam email, which could be sent to an individual or a group of individuals or a company. These spam emails may cause serious threat to the user i.e., the email addresses used for any online registrations may be collected by the malignant third parties (spammers) and they expose the genuine user to various kinds of attacks. Another method of spamming is by creating a temporary email register and receive emails that can be terminated after some certain amount of time. This method is well suited for misusing those temporary email addresses for sending free spam emails without revealing the spammers real account details. These attacks create major problems like theft of user credentials, lack of storage, etc. Hence it is essential to introduce an efficient detection mechanismthrough feature extraction and classification for detecting spam emails and temporary email addresses. This can be accomplished through a novel Natural Language Processing based Random Forest (NLP-RF) approach. With the help of our proposed approach, the spam emails are reduced and this method improves the accuracy of spam email filtering, since the use of NLP makes the system to detect the natural languages spoken by people and the Random Forest approach uses multiple decision trees and uses a random node for filtering the spams.",

        "abstract": "Selecting a feature in data mining is one of the most challenging and important activities in pattern recognition. The issue of feature selection is to find the most important subset of the main features in a specific domain, the main purpose of which is to remove additional or unrelated features and ultimately improve the accuracy of the categorization algorithms. As a result, the issue of feature selection can be considered as an optimization problem and to solve it, meta-innovative algorithms can be used. In this paper, a new hybrid model with a combination of whale optimization algorithms and flower pollination algorithms is presented to address the problem of feature selection based on the concept of opposition-based learning. In the proposed method, we tried to solve the problem of optimization of feature selection by using natural processes of whale optimization and flower pollination algorithms, and on the other hand, we used opposition-based learning method to ensure the convergence speed and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. In fact, in the proposed method, the whale optimization algorithm uses the bait siege process, bubble attack method and bait search, creates solutions in its search space and tries to improve the solutions to the feature selection problem, and along with this algorithm, Flower pollination algorithm with two national and local search processes improves the solution of the problem selection feature in contrasting solutions with the whale optimization algorithm. In fact, we used both search space solutions and contrasting search space solutions, all possible solutions to the feature selection problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are performed in two stages. In the first phase, experiments were performed on 10 sets of data selection features from the UCI data repository. In the second step, we tried to test the performance of the proposed algorithm by detecting spam emails. The results obtained from the first step show that the proposed algorithm, by running on 10 UCI data sets, has been able to be more successful in terms of average selection size and classification accuracy than other basic meta-heuristic algorithms. Also, the results obtained from the second step show that the proposed algorithm has been able to perform spam emails more accurately than other similar algorithms in terms of accuracy by detecting spam emails.",
