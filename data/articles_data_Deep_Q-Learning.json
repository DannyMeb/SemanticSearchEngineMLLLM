        "abstract": "Deep learning is a more situational and reflective way of learning that integrates complex knowledge and skills into intuitive thinking. As a language that closely combines sound, form and meaning, Chinese teaching and learning from the perspective of deep learning can help break through the limitations of the current teaching model that only focuses on certain language knowledge or cultural behaviors. This paper combines deep learning with international Chinese education, creates deep Chinese teaching and learning model including “four stages and ten steps”, and carries out practical application and teaching effect test. The results show that the deep Chinese teaching and learning model is conducive to improving students’ discourse presentation ability and comprehensive skills, cultivating the learners’ autonomous learning ability and intercultural communication competence, and strengthening the integration of language teaching and cultural teaching. At the same time, this model also has some limitations, need to be further adjusted and optimized.",

To validate the diagnosis results, various clinical parameters must be defined. In this context, several algorithms and mathematical tools have been developed in the last two decades to extract accurate information from medical images or signals. Traditionally, the extraction of features using image processing from medical data are time-consuming which requires human interaction and expert validation. The segmentation of medical images, the classification of medical images, and the significance of deep learning-based algorithms in disease detection are all topics covered in this chapter.",

        "abstract": "Informal learning is a universal current phenomenon of learning via participation, experience, or learning via student-centered knowledge creation. It stands in stark contrast with the traditional view of didactic teacher-centered learning. Online education can be regarded as a positive and self-directed form of informal learning. Whether or not deep learning takes place for the online learner is a controversial topic for many educators. This chapter will discuss the benefits and challenges of the relationship between informal online learning leading to deeper learning. But, what isn't controversial is that in this century more education has been delivered in digital platforms than in any other time in history. For most providers of education to remain highly competitive, they must engage in electronic education of some form by moving beyond the brick and mortar of the traditional classroom. Informal learning has become the impetus resulting in the extensive and intensive application of electronic education. ",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there's been a resurgence in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is gaining a lot of attention. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms that can be used to model high-level abstractions in data by using multiple processing layers with complex structures, or otherwise composed of multiple non-linear transformations. Estimation of depth in a Neural Network (NN) or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an integral as well as complicated process. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. This chapter describes the motivations for deep architecture, problem with large networks, the need for deep architecture and new implementation techniques for deep learning. At the end, there is also an algorithm to implement the deep architecture using the recursive nature of functions and transforming them to get the desired output. ",

Article presents reinforcement learning (RL) as a tool for the manager on the path to learning winning behavior in the complex environment of organization management. Organization management has wicked learning challenges because agents are under biases that prevent understanding the phenomenon of delayed reward. Therefore, the digital simulation with RL is effective forming breakthrough learning results. Human capital management theories provide architecture in creating organization digital twin where agent can practice management actions effect on business economics and staff wellbeing. Utilizing RL algorithms, it is possible to foster behavior for creating sustainable competitive advantage – this means the Nash equilibrium between profit and staff wellbeing. In this digital twin there is AI learning assistant as a teacher that provides demonstrations on how to act so that the delayed reward is good in the future. The article explains game theoretical approach that is the foundation for creating management deep learning AI system. Human agent at the organization is playing the game of Strategic Stochastic Bayesian Nonsymmetric Signaling game in co-operative or non-cooperative way and at zero-sum or general sum game mind-set.",

Furthermore, risk-based security, as a means of improving travelers’ experience at check points is expected to reduce queueing and waiting times while improving at the same travelers’ experience during checks. A number of projects have been funded by the European Commission to investigate the concept of risk-based security and develop the means and technology required to implement it. The author is the Coordinator of two of the flagship projects funded by EC on risk-based security: FLYSEC and TRESSPASS. This chapter discusses and analyses the concept of risk-based security, the inherent competing mechanism between risk assessment, screening time and level of security, and means to implement risk-based security based on anomaly detection using deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) methods.",

More recently, deep learning has been widely used in optimising the performance of nanophotonic devices, where the conventional computational approach may require much computation time and significant computation source. In this chapter, we briefly review the recent progress of deep learning in nanophotonics. We overview the applications of the deep learning approach to optimising the various nanophotonic devices. It includes multilayer structures, plasmonic/dielectric metasurfaces and plasmonic chiral metamaterials. Also, nanophotonic can directly serve as an ideal platform to mimic optical neural networks based on nonlinear optical media, which in turn help to achieve high-performance photonic chips that may not be realised based on conventional design method.",

        "abstract": "The long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). During the training of RNN architecture, sequential information is used and travels through the neural network from input vector to the output neurons, while the error is calculated and propagated back through the network to update the network parameters. Information in these networks incorporates loops into the hidden layer. Loops allow information to flow multi-directionally so that the hidden state signifies past information held at a given time step. Consequently, the output is dependent on the previous predictions which are already known. However, RNNs have limited capacity to bridge more than a certain number of steps. Mainly this is due to the vanishing of gradients which causes the predictions to capture the short-term dependencies as information from earlier steps decays. As more layers in RNN containing activation functions are added, the gradient of the loss function approaches zero. The LSTM neural networks (LSTM-ANNs) enable learning long-term dependencies. LSTM introduces a memory unit and gate mechanism to enable capture of the long dependencies in a sequence. Therefore, LSTM networks can selectively remember or forget information and are capable of learn thousands timesteps by structures called cell states and three gates.",

        "abstract": "“Deep learning” uses Post-Selection—selection of a model after training multiple models using data. The performance data of “Seep Learning” have been deceptively inflated due to two misconducts: 1: cheating in the absence of a test; 2: hiding bad-looking data. Through the same misconducts, a simple method Pure-Guess Nearest Neighbor (PGNN) gives no errors on any validation dataset V, as long as V is in the possession of the authors and both the amount of storage space and the time of training are finite but unbounded. The misconducts are fatal, because “Deep Learning” is not generalizable, by overfitting a sample set V. The charges here are applicable to all learning modes. This chapter proposes new AI metrics, called developmental errors for all networks trained, under four Learning Conditions: (1) a body including sensors and effectors, (2) an incremental learning architecture (due to the “big data” flaw), (3) a training experience, and (4) a limited amount of computational resources. Developmental Networks avoid Deep Learning misconduct because they train a sole system, which automatically discovers context rules on the fly by generating emergent Turing machines that are optimal in the sense of maximum likelihood across a lifetime, conditioned on the four Learning Conditions.",
