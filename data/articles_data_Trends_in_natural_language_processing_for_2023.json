        "abstract": "The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed lifestyles in much of the world. It forced people to profoundly review their relationships and interactions with digital technologies. Nevertheless, people prefer using these technologies in their favorite languages.   Unfortunately, most languages are considered even as low or less-resourced, and they do not have the potential to keep up with the new needs. Therefore, this study explores how this kind of languages, mainly the Amazigh, will behave in the wholly digital environment, and what to expect for new trends.  Contrary to last decades, the research gap of low and less-resourced languages is continually reducing. Nonetheless, the literature review exploration unveils the need for innovative research to review their informatization roadmap, while rethinking, in a valuable way, people’s behaviors in this increasingly changing environment. Through this work, we will try first to introduce the technology access challenges, and explain how natural language processing contributes to their overcoming. Then, we will give an overview of existing studies and research related to under and less-resourced languages’ informatization, with an emphasis on the Amazigh language. After, based on these studies and the agile revolution, a new roadmap will be presented.",

        "abstract": "Significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have unexpectedly improved the standard of living globally. One recent development garnering attention is ChatGPT, a natural language processing (NLP) model created by OpenAI. ChatGPT combines OpenAI's GPT-2 language model with supervised and reinforcement learning techniques, leveraging the extensive language patterns in the GPT-3 corpus. This enables natural text-based interactions between users and AI systems, making it suitable for customer service applications and the creation of voice and text-based virtual assistants. ChatGPT offers features such as topic detection, sentiment detection, sentiment analysis, and the ability to generate multiple threads, enhancing users' understanding and enabling realistic interactions. This paper explores the challenges in AI development and proposed strategies to overcome them. It further examines how ChatGPT can enhance sectors such as chat e-commerce, education, entertainment, finance, health, news, and productivity, highlighting current use cases and potential future applications. The article emphasizes ChatGPT's potential to generate personalized content, making it a promising technology for improving user experiences and advancing AI-driven interactions.",

Platforms like YouTube are incredibly active, with a constant influx of video uploads, views, and comments. While the YouTube app allows us to browse videos and comments, it offers only a limited glimpse into the interests and trends of others. Analysing this vast data pool, encompassing diverse language styles, presents a significant challenge. This article delves into the YouTube Data API and its application in Python for accessing raw data. The process involves data cleaning using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, harnessing Python-based machine learning to explore social media interactions, and automating the extraction of trends and influential factors. The journey towards trend analysis is meticulously detailed, featuring examples that leverage a variety of open-source Python tools.",

        "abstract": "In the insurance industry nowadays, data is carrying the major asset and playing a key role. There is a wealth of information available to insurance transporters nowadays. We can identify three major eras in the insurance industry's more than 700-year history. The industry follows the manual era from the 15th century to 1960, the systems era from 1960 to 2000, and the current digital era, i.e., 2001-20X0. The core insurance sector has been decided by trusting data analytics and implementing new technologies to improve and maintain existing practices and maintain capital together. This has been the highest corporate object in all three periods.AI techniques have been progressively utilized for a variety of insurance activities in recent years. In this study, we give a comprehensive general assessment of the existing research that incorporates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) methods into all essential insurance jobs. Our work provides a more comprehensive review of this research, even if there have already been a number of them published on the topic of using artificial intelligence for certain insurance jobs. We study algorithms for learning, big data, block chain, data mining, and conversational theory, and their applications in insurance policy, claim prediction, risk estimation, and other fields in order to comprehensively integrate existing work in the insurance sector using AI approaches.",

        "abstract": "The number of patients diagnosed with depression yearly is a growing concern among mental health advocates. Consequently, the ef ect of this ailment is detrimental to not only the patient but also family members, as well as their jobs or school. Many factors, ranging from hereditary conditions to life-altering experiences, can trigger depression, and symptoms vary between individuals. Hence, the disparity of symptoms in diagnosing depression makes it dif icult to identify early on. Fortunately, the prevalence of social media platforms has led to individuals posting updates on various aspects of their lives, particularly their mental health. These platforms now provide valuable data sources for mental health researchers, aiding in the timely diagnosis of depression. In this research, we use sentiment analysis to identify depressed tweets from random tweets. We used six natural language processing frameworks for our classification. They are BERT, XLNet, ALBERT, DeBERTa, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA. Our results show that BERT performs best with an accuracy of 99%, while ALBERT is the model with the lowest accuracy rate at 87%. This research shows that by leveraging NLP frameworks, we can successfully utilize machine learning for the early detection of depression and help diagnose individuals struggling with this ailment.",

        "abstract": "With the ability to predict political outcomes and provide insights into public opinion, using Twitter data to predict election results has gained popularity. Twitter offers a massive supply of data for analysis due to its enormous user base and real-time nature. Researchers use sentiment analysis tools to categorize tweets as good, harmful, or neutral and follow sentiment patterns over time. Network analysis finds influential users and digs deeper into the dynamics of political discourse. The accuracy of predictions is improved by combining traditional polling data with machine learning methods. Twitter data analysis has the potential to offer insightful information for election campaigns and improve political strategies despite issues like representativeness and identifying genuine sentiment. Ongoing research focuses on refining methodologies and addressing limitations, advancing the reliability of election prediction using Twitter data. The paper shows the results of election prediction for Indian political parties based on Twitter data",

        "abstract": "This study investigates digitalization in the shipping industry by analyzing over 500 industry presentations from an eight-year span to discern key trends and nascent signals. Employing optical character recognition, advanced natural language processing techniques, and similarity metrics, the research enhances topic interpretability. Through Theil–Sen regressions and diffusion metrics, it identifies trends and emerging signals, noting a rise in interest in smart ports and supply chain management, signaling a shift toward more intelligent technology integration. However, attention to supply chain management shows a decline. The research tracks a shift from broad technology themes to specific areas like cybersecurity and blockchain, reflecting a narrative pivot to tackle particular digital challenges and opportunities. The study detects weak signals, including terms like “subsea” and “drone”, suggesting forthcoming industry innovations and shifts, notably toward ESG considerations. An additional machine learning analysis corroborates findings on key topics like energy efficiency and crew welfare, also spotlighting virtual disaster recovery and ERP projects as emerging areas of interest. This work aids in comprehending the fluid digitalization landscape in shipping, highlighting the sector’s ongoing evolution, and underscoring the need for further inquiry into autonomous shipping and related domains.",

        "abstract": "ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, which was introduced in 2019. It employs a transformer-based neural mesh to produce human being responses in real-time, allowing for natural language conversations with a machine. ChatGPT is instructed on huge quantities of data captured using the internet, making it knowledgeable in an extensive span of topics, from news & entertainment to politics and sports. This allows it to generate contextually relevant responses to questions and statements, making the conversation seem more lifelike. The model can be used in various applications, including customer service, personal assistants, and virtual assistants. ChatGPT has also shown promising results in generating creative content, such as jokes and poetry, showcasing its versatility and potential for future applications.This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on ChatGPT, highlighting its key advantages, such as improved accuracy and flexibility compared to traditional NLP tools, as well as its limitations and the need for further research to address potential ethical concerns. The review also highlights the potential for ChatGPT to be used in NLP applications, including question-answering and dialogue generation, and highlights the need for further research and development in these areas.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHaving a reliable classification of knowledge assets in a corporate knowledge base system in an oil and gas company is challenging. This is due to the tremendous amount and variety of knowledge assets generated by complex business and engineering processes. Submission of the knowledge assets is one of the main challenges as users may choose the wrong knowledge type or classification. A lengthy manual review process is required to evaluate the submission and some need to be rejected and returned to users. Incorrect classification of knowledge assets may cause issues in knowledge search engines as users cannot find correct articles due to the misclassification of the knowledge assets. In another challenge, some assets knowledge submission is duplicated as other users have submitted the same assets.Our research evaluates the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications in the form of neural language modeling transformers. The models will generate the following functions: Knowledge categorization: Automatically categorizes the knowledge items based on the given abstract. This will reduce the possibility of the wrong classification that can prevent the knowledge from being published, simplify knowledge submission and expedite the knowledge review process.Text Summarization: Automatically generating a summary of knowledge assets that can be used as short descriptions or abstracts during knowledge submission.Document Semantic Similarity: Identifies similar documents in terms of the context that can help for document search or deletion of duplicate documents",

        "abstract": "Terrorism has become a worldwide plague with severe consequences for the development of nations. Besides killing innocent people daily and preventing educational activities from taking place, terrorism is also hindering economic growth. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can contribute to fighting terrorism by predicting in real-time future terrorist attacks if accurate data is available. This paper is part of a research project that uses text from social networks to extract necessary information to build an adequate dataset for terrorist attack prediction. We collected a set of 3000 social network texts about terrorism in Burkina Faso and used a subset to experiment with existing NLP solutions. The experiment reveals that existing solutions have poor accuracy for location recognition, which our solution resolves. We will extend the solution to extract dates and action information to achieve the project's goal.",

As one of the initial domains of inquiry in the domain of machine learning, it has been utilized in a variety of significant sub-disciplines, such as text processing, speech recognition, and machine translation. Natural language processing has contributed to notable progress in computing and artificial intelligence. The recurrent neural network serves as a fundamental component for numerous techniques in domain of NLP. The present article conducts a comprehensive evaluation of various algorithms for processing textual and voice data, accompanied by illustrative instances of their functionality. Various algorithmic outcomes exhibit the advancements achieved in this field during the preceding decade. Our endeavor involved the classification of algorithms based on their respective types and expounding on the scope for future research in this domain. Furthermore, the study elucidates the potential applications of these heterogeneous algorithms and also evaluates the disparities among them through an analysis of the findings. Despite the fact that natural language processing has not yet achieved its ultimate objective of flawlessness, it is plausible that with sufficient exertion, the field will eventually attain it. Currently, a wide variety of artificial intelligence systems use natural language processing algorithms to comprehend human-spoken directions.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing competition in the telecom sector, accurate churn prediction has become indispensable for service providers seeking to retain customers. This research paper introduces a novel approach that combines Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and specifically leveraging the XGBoost algorithm, to enhance the precision and efficiency of churn prediction in the telecom industry. The integration of NLP enables the extraction of meaningful insights from diverse data sources, while XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, is employed to build a robust predictive model for identifying potential churners. A machine learning method called the XGBoost churn prediction model is utilized in the telecom industry to forecast client churn. To construct a predictive model that can precisely identify consumers prone to churn, XGBoost is essentially an ensemble method based on gradient-enhanced trees. Several telecom carriers have used this model to understand their consumers better and identify issues that can contribute to churn. It has been used to predict churn in the telecom sector accurately. The model has been tested for accuracy and effectiveness in identifying factors and forecasting customer attrition. These evaluations' findings indicate that the XGBoost model is a trustworthy and precise method for forecasting customer attrition in the telecom industry.",

        "abstract": "Sign Language Recognition is a variant of Action Recognition that consists of more detailed features, such as hand shapes and movements. Researchers have been trying to apply computer-based methods to tackle this task throughout the years. However, the methods proposed are constrained by hardware limitations, thus limiting them from being applied in real-life situations. In this research, we explore the possibilities of creating a lightweight Sign Language Recognition model so that it can be applied in real-life situations. We explore two different approaches. First, we extract keypoints and use a simple LSTM model to do the recognition and get 75% of Top-1 Validation Accuracy. We used the lightweight MoViNet A0 model for the second one and achieved 71% of Top-1 Test accuracy. Although these models achieved worse results than the state-of-the-art I3D, their complexity in terms of FLOPs is far better.",
