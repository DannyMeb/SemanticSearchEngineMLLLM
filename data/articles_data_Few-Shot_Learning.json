        "abstract": "In recent years, deep-learning-based WiFi fingerprinting has been intensively studied as a promising technology for providing accurate indoor location services. However, it still demands a time-consuming and labor-intensive site survey and suffers from the fluctuation of wireless signals. To address these issues, we propose a prototypical network-based positioning system, which explores the power of few-shot learning to establish a robust RSSI-position matching model with limited labels. Our system uses a temporal convolutional network as the encoder to learn an embedding of the individual sample, as well as its quality. Each prototype is a weighted combination of the embedded support samples belonging to its position. Online positioning is performed for an embedded query sample by simply finding the nearest position prototype. To mitigate the space ambiguity caused by signal fluctuation, the Kalman Filter estimates the most likely current RSSI based on the historical measurements and current measurement in the online stage. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs better than the existing deep-learning-based models with fewer labeled samples.",

        "abstract": "<abstract><p>In recent years, with the development of science and technology, powerful computing devices have been constantly developing. As an important foundation, deep learning (DL) technology has achieved many successes in multiple fields. In addition, the success of deep learning also relies on the support of large-scale datasets, which can provide models with a variety of images. The rich information in these images can help the model learn more about various categories of images, thereby improving the classification performance and generalization ability of the model. However, in real application scenarios, it may be difficult for most tasks to collect a large number of images or enough images for model training, which also restricts the performance of the trained model to a certain extent. Therefore, how to use limited samples to train the model with high performance becomes key. In order to improve this problem, the few-shot learning (FSL) strategy is proposed, which aims to obtain a model with strong performance through a small amount of data. Therefore, FSL can play its advantages in some real scene tasks where a large number of training data cannot be obtained. In this review, we will mainly introduce the FSL methods for image classification based on DL, which are mainly divided into four categories: methods based on data enhancement, metric learning, meta-learning and adding other tasks. First, we introduce some classic and advanced FSL methods in the order of categories. Second, we introduce some datasets that are often used to test the performance of FSL methods and the performance of some classical and advanced FSL methods on two common datasets. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects in this field.</p></abstract>",

        "abstract": "Few-shot learning which aims to generalize knowledge learned from annotated base training data to recognize unseen novel classes has attracted considerable attention. Existing few-shot methods rely on completely clean training data. However, in the real world, the training data are always corrupted and accompanied by noise due to the disturbance in data transmission and low-quality annotation, which severely degrades the performance and generalization capability of few-shot models. To address the problem, we propose a unified peer-collaboration learning (PCL) framework to extract valid knowledge from corrupted data for few-shot learning. PCL leverages two modules to mimic the peer collaboration process which cooperatively evaluates the importance of each sample. Specifically, each module first estimates the importance weights of different samples by encoding the information provided by the other module from both global and local perspectives. Then, both modules leverage the obtained importance weights to guide the reevaluation of the loss value of each sample. In this way, the peers can mutually absorb knowledge to improve the robustness of few-shot models. Experiments verify that our framework combined with different few-shot methods can significantly improve the performance and robustness of original models.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGradient-based meta-learning techniques aim to distill useful prior knowledge from a set of training tasks such that new tasks can be learned more efficiently with gradient descent. While these methods have achieved successes in various scenarios, they commonly adapt all parameters of trainable layers when learning new tasks. This neglects potentially more efficient learning strategies for a given task distribution and may be susceptible to overfitting, especially in few-shot learning where tasks must be learned from a limited number of examples. To address these issues, we propose Subspace Adaptation Prior (SAP), a novel gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that jointly learns good initialization parameters (prior knowledge) and layer-wise parameter subspaces in the form of operation subsets that should be adaptable. In this way, SAP can learn which operation subsets to adjust with gradient descent based on the underlying task distribution, simultaneously decreasing the risk of overfitting when learning new tasks. We demonstrate that this ability is helpful as SAP yields superior or competitive performance in few-shot image classification settings (gains between 0.1% and 3.9% in accuracy). Analysis of the learned subspaces demonstrates that low-dimensional operations often yield high activation strengths, indicating that they may be important for achieving good few-shot learning performance. For reproducibility purposes, we publish all our research code publicly.",

        "abstract": "Plant leaf disease is one of the important factors affecting the normal growth of plants. It is important to accurately identify the types of leaf disease and take effective measures to ensure the increase of crop production. In this study, we propose a plant leaf diseases classification method based on Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which can obtain good identification accuracy in the classification task with few samples. By changing the parameter setting in FSL, some key features affecting classification accuracy are revealed. The proposal of this research method expands the application scope of artificial intelligence in agriculture, which has important practical significance.",

        "abstract": "Speckle noise has long been an extensively studied problem in medical imaging. In recent years, there have been significant advances in leveraging deep learning methods for noise reduction. Nevertheless, adaptation of supervised learning models to unseen domains remains a challenging problem. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained for computational imaging tasks are vulnerable to changes in the acquisition system’s physical parameters, such as: sampling space, resolution, and contrast. Even within the same acquisition system, performance degrades across datasets of different biological tissues. In this work, we propose a few-shot supervised learning framework for optical coherence tomography (OCT) noise reduction, that offers high-speed training (of the order of seconds) and requires only a single image, or part of an image, and a corresponding speckle-suppressed ground truth, for training. Furthermore, we formulate the domain shift problem for OCT diverse imaging systems and prove that the output resolution of a despeckling trained model is determined by the source domain resolution. We also provide possible remedies. We propose different practical implementations of our approach, verify and compare their applicability, robustness, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate the potential to improve sample complexity, generalization, and time efficiency, for coherent and non-coherent noise reduction via supervised learning models, that can also be leveraged for other real-time computer vision applications.",

Through self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised fine-tuning, the model can effectively utilize limited annotated data and expand the training set by generating high-quality pseudo-labels.

        "abstract": "With the advent of deep learning and the accessibility of massive data, scene classification algorithms based on deep learning have been extensively researched and have achieved exciting developments. However, the success of deep models often relies on a large amount of annotated remote sensing data. Additionally, deep models are typically trained and tested on the same set of classes, leading to compromised generalization performance when encountering new classes. This is where few-shot learning aims to enable models to quickly generalize to new classes with only a few reference samples. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative self-supervised transductive few-shot learning (CS2TFSL) algorithm for remote sensing scene classification. In our approach, we construct two distinct self-supervised auxiliary tasks to jointly train the feature extractor, aiming to obtain a powerful representation. Subsequently, the feature extractor’s parameters are frozen, requiring no further training, and transferred to the inference stage. During testing, we employ transductive inference to enhance the associative information between the support and query sets by leveraging additional sample information in the data. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art few-shot scene classification algorithms on the WHU-RS19 and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS2TFSL. More specifically, CS2TFSL ranks first in the settings of five-way one-shot and five-way five-shot. Additionally, detailed ablation experiments are conducted to analyze the CS2TFSL. The experimental results reveal significant and promising performance improvements in few-shot scene classification through the combination of self-supervised learning and direct transductive inference.",

        "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is essential in many practical applications. However, the limited training examples make the models more vulnerable to label noise, which can lead to poor generalization capability. To address this critical challenge, we propose a curriculum meta-learning model that employs a novel dual-level class-example sampling strategy to create a robust curriculum for adaptive task distribution formulation and robust model training. The dual-level framework proposes a heuristic class sampling criterion that measures pairwise class boundary complexity to form a class curriculum; it uses effective example sampling through an under-trained proxy model to form an example curriculum. By utilizing both class-level and example-level information, our approach is more robust to handle limited training data and noisy labels that commonly occur in few-shot learning tasks.\nThe model has efficient convergence behavior, which is verified through rigorous convergence analysis. Additionally, we establish a novel error bound through a hierarchical PAC-Bayesian analysis for curriculum meta-learning under noise. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in outperforming existing noisy few-shot learning methods under various few-shot classification benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Recently, the number of Internet of Things (IoT)-connected devices has increased daily. Consequently, cybersecurity challenges have increased due to the natural diversity of the IoT, limited hardware resources, and limited security capabilities. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a substantial role in securing IoT networks. Several researchers have focused on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to develop intrusion detection techniques. Although ML is good for classification, other methods perform better in feature transformation. However, at the level of accuracy, both learning techniques have their own certain compromises. Although IDSs based on ML and DL methods can achieve a high detection rate, the performance depends on the training dataset size. Incidentally, collecting a large amount of data is one of the main drawbacks that limits performance when training datasets are lacking, and such methods can fail to detect novel attacks. Few-shot learning (FSL) is an emerging approach that is employed in different domains because of its proven ability to learn from a few training samples. Although numerous studies have addressed the issues of IDSs and improved IDS performance, the literature on FSL-based IDSs is scarce. Therefore, an investigation is required to explore the performance of FSL in IoT IDSs. This work proposes an IoT intrusion detection model based on a convolutional neural network as a feature extractor and a prototypical network as an FSL classifier. The empirical results were analyzed and compared with those of recent intrusion detection approaches. The accuracy results reached 99.44%, which shows a promising direction for involving FSL in IoT IDSs.",

        "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning, a subfield of machine learning, aims to solve the problem of learning new tasks with only a small amount of annotated data. Compared to traditional supervised learning, Few-Shot Learning is more challenging because there are very few training samples available during the training process, which means that the model must learn quickly and generalize to new samples. Prompt learning is a recently emerged training paradigm in natural language processing, which can quickly leverage the language capabilities of large pre-trained language models to achieve fast start-up. Based on the prompt learning paradigm, this paper proposes to use its conjugate tasks to further enhance the model's ability in few-shot learning. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of the model on multiple datasets and can be combined quickly with other methods for joint optimization.",

        "abstract": "Complex tasks in the real world involve different modal models, such as visual question answering (VQA). However, traditional multimodal learning requires a large amount of aligned data, such as image text pairs, and constructing a large amount of training data is a challenge for multimodal learning. Therefore, we propose VL-Few, which is a simple and effective method to solve the multimodal few-shot problem. VL-Few (1) proposes the modal alignment, which aligns visual features into language space through a lightweight model network and improves the multimodal understanding ability of the model; (2) adopts few-shot meta learning in the multimodal problem, which constructs a few-shot meta task pool to improve the generalization ability of the model; (3) proposes semantic alignment to enhance the semantic understanding ability of the model for the task, context, and demonstration; (4) proposes task alignment that constructs training data into the target task form and improves the task understanding ability of the model; (5) proposes generation alignment, which adopts the token-level training and multitask fusion loss to improve the generation ability of the model. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of VL-Few for multimodal few-shot problems.",
