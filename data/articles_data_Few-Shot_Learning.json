A learning to teach small-data learning strategy (L2TSDL) is proposed to solve this problem. In this strategy, the teacher model will calculate the importance score for every training sample and help student to make use of all training samples.",

There have been great advancements towards more efficient and adaptive AI systems with few-shot learning and zero-shot learning, respectively, which can learn from minimal data and infer from particular data instances without previous exposure. Nevertheless, there are several limits and difficulties associated with these procedures. This chapter delves deeply into the theoretical foundations of both techniques, explaining how they work and what problems they solve in different ways. It examines the semantic gap, domain adaptation problems, and model bias, as well as the computational restrictions, overfitting, and model generalizability that are intrinsic to few-shot learning and zero-shot learning, respectively. We may better understand the ideas' potential use in different real-world contexts by comparing and contrasting them.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance of few-shot learning, the lack of labeled training data in the real world, makes it extremely challenging for existing machine learning methods as this limited data set does not represent the data variance well. In this research, we suggest employing a generative approach using variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be used specifically to optimize few-shot learning tasks by generating new samples with more intra-class variations. The purpose of our research is to increase the size of the training data set using various methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of the few-shot face recognition. Specifically, we employ the VAE generator to increase the size of the training data set, including the basic and the novel sets while utilizing transfer learning as the backend. Based on extensive experimental research, we analyze various data augmentation methods to observe how each method affects the accuracy of face recognition. We conclude that the face generation method we proposed can effectively improve the recognition accuracy rate to 96.47% using both the base and the novel sets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Cotton diceases seriously affect the yield and quality of cotton. The type of pest or disease suffered by cotton can be determined by the disease spots on the cotton leaves. This paper presents a small-sample learning framework that can be used for cotton leaf disease spot classification task, which using deep learning techniques is constructed based on a metric learning approach, to prevent and control cotton diseases timely. First, disease spots on cotton leaf's disease images are segmented by different methods, compared by using support vector machine (SVM) method and threshold segmentation, and discussed the suitable one. With segmented disease spot images as input, a disease spot dataset is established, and the cotton leaf disease spots were classified using a classical convolutional neural network classifier, the structure and framework of convolutional neural network had been designed, and the setting of relevant parameters and the detailed network structure configuration are analyzed according to the experimental environment. The features of two different images are extracted by a parallel two-way convolutional neural network with weight sharing. Then, the network uses a loss function to learn the metric space, in which similar leaf samples are close to each other and different leaf samples are far away from each other. Results: To achieve the classification of cotton leaf spots by small sample learning, this paper constructs a metric-based learning method to extract cotton leaf spot features and classify the leaves. In the process of leaf spot extraction, image segmentation of the spots is performed by threshold segmentation and SVM, and comparative analysis is performed. In the process of leaf spot classification, the structural framework of leaf spot feature extractor and feature classifier is constructed, and the overall framework is built using the idea of two-way parallel convolutional neural network. A variety of excellent convolutional neural network feature extractors such as Vgg, DesenNet, and ResNet were used for feature extraction work, and a combination design based on the small sample classification framework was performed and compared. Experimentally, it is demonstrated that the classification accuracy is improved by nearly 7.7% on average for different number of samples in the case of using this optimizer. S-DesneNet have the highest accuracy. When n is 5, 10, 15 and 20, the accuracy is 58.63%, 84.41% ,92.51% and 91.75%, respectively, and the average accuracy is improved by nearly 7.7% compared with DenseNet. Conclusions: To solve the problem of classification accuracy degradation due to small number of samples in small sample training tasks, a spatial structure optimizer (SSO) acting on the training process is proposed for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSpectrum prediction using deep learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Although existing deep learning methods have dramatically increased the pre-diction accuracy, there is still considerable space for improvement, which is presently limited by the difference of fragmentation types or instrument settings. In this work, we use the few-shot learning method to fit the data online to make up for the shortcoming. The method is evaluated using ten datasets, where the instruments includes Velos, QE, Lumos, and Sciex, with collision energies being differently set. Experimental results show that few-shot learning can achieve higher prediction accuracy with almost negligible computing resources. For example, on the dataset from a untrained instrument Sciex-6600, within about 10 seconds, the prediction accuracy is increased from 69.7% to 86.4%; on the CID (collision-induced dissociation) dataset, the prediction accuracy of the model trained by HCD (higher energy collision dissociation) spectra is increased from 48.0% to 83.9%. It is also shown that, the method is not critical to data quality and is sufficiently efficient to fill the accuracy gap.

However, current applied social science research which relies on these models tend to use closed-source models and zero-shot learning. This study contrasts the performance of state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with their open-source counterparts across 10 multi-class classification tasks critical to social science research, such as emotion detection and political speech classification. In addition, we introduce dynamic few-shot learning, an enhancement to static few-shot learning, that leverages semantic similarity to dynamically choose contextually relevant examples from a pre-defined corpus for improved prompt engineering. Our research indicates that dynamic few-shot learning significantly boosts classification performance, especially for much smaller models. Our findings help expand the methodological toolbox for social scientists and suggest more transparent, ethical, and efficient ways of leveraging the power of LLMs in social science research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses few-shot semantic segmentation and proposes a novel transductive end-to-end method that overcomes three key problems affecting performance. First, we present a novel ensemble of visual features learned from pretrained classification and semantic segmentation networks with the same architecture. Our approach leverages the varying dis-criminative power of these networks, resulting in visual features that capture rich and diverse information at different depths. Secondly, the pretrained semantic segmentation network serves as a base class extractor, which significantly reduces false positives. Thirdly, a transductive meta-learning method addresses the prediction by first learning the relationship between labeled and unlabeled data points with matching support foreground to query features (intra-class similarity) and then applying this knowledge to predict on the unlabeled query image (intra-object similarity), which simultaneously learns propagation and false positive suppression. To evaluate our method, we performed experiments on benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate significant improvement, with minimal trainable parameters 2.98M. Specifically, using Resnet-101, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for both 1-shot and 5-shot Pascal-5i , as well as on 1-shot and 5-shot COCO-20i .",

        "abstract": "Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) constitute the most valuable aspect of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). However, TTPs are often implicit in unstructured text, necessitating manual analysis by field experts. Automating the classification of TTPs from unstructured text is a crucial task in contemporary research. MITRE ATT&amp;CK serves as the de facto standard for studying TTPs. Existing research constructs classification datasets based on its procedural examples for tactics and techniques. However, due to a significant proportion of small sample categories, a long-tail phenomenon exists, leading to a highly imbalanced sample distribution. Consequently, more research concentrates on categories with relatively abundant samples. This paper proposes a method that combines ChatGPT data augmentation with Instruction Supervised Fine-Tuning of open large language models. This approach offers a solution for TTPs classification in few-shot learning scenarios, achieving coverage of 625 technical categories. The Precision, Recall, and F1 scores reach 86.2%, 89.9%, and 87.3%, respectively.",

From monitoring environmental changes and disaster management toprecision agriculture and urban planning, the applications of remote sensing arewide-ranging. One of the challenges in remote sensing is the need to recognize andclassify objects or phenomena with limited labeled data, a scenario often referredto as few-shot learning. Few-shot learning in remote sensing tasks presents unique challenges due to thescarcity of annotated samples for a wide variety of land cover and land usecategories. Traditional machine learning techniques often struggle to adapt to thesedata constraints, limiting the ability to accurately detect and classify objects ofinterest. To address this, researchers have turned to advanced machine learningtechniques, including contrastive learning, to improve few-shot learning in remotesensing",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing technology has revolutionized the way we perceive and interact with our planet, enablingus to acquire invaluable information about our environment, natural resources, and ecosystems. Frommonitoring land use changes to studying climate patterns and disaster management, remote sensing hasbecome an indispensable tool for scientific research and practical applications. However, the effective application of remote sensing data often relies on the ability to classify andinterpret these vast and complex datasets. This presents a substantial challenge, as remote sensing datatypically exhibit high dimensionality, encompassing diverse terrain types, weather conditions, andimaging modalities. Furthermore, acquiring labeled data for supervised machine learning approaches isoften arduous, time-consuming, and expensive in remote sensing contexts. Few-shot learning emerges as a promising paradigm to address these issues. It seeks to develop modelscapable of learning from a limited amount of labeled data, which is a common scenario in remote sensingapplications due to the cost and effort associated with ground truth data collection. Few-shot learning isespecially valuable in cases where we need to recognize previously unseen classes or adapt quickly tochanging conditions, such as tracking forest fires or monitoring urban development. Despite its potential, few-shot learning in remote sensing faces significant hurdles, such as inadequatemodel generalization, limited data diversity, and challenges in feature extraction from complex datasources. In recent years, several advancements have been made in remote sensing image analysis, including the integration of deep learning techniques, but there remains a critical need for improving few- shot learning capabilities in this domain. This paper introduces a novel approach to address the limitations of few-shot learning in remote sensing. We propose the incorporation of an auxiliary generator powered by contrastive learning, a technique thathas demonstrated success in diverse applications, from natural language processing to computer vision. This auxiliary generator, working in conjunction with our few-shot learning model, enhances the ability todiscriminate between different classes and adapt to new remote sensing scenarios with limited labeleddata",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInformation extraction provides the basic technical support for knowledge graph construction and Web applications. Named entity recognition(NER) is one of the fundamental tasks of information extraction. Recognizing unseen entities from numerous contents with the support of only a few labeled samples, also termed as few-shot learning, is a crucial issue to be studied. Few-shot NER aims at identifying emerging named entities from the context with the support of a few labeled samples. Existing methods mainly use the same strategy to construct a single prototype for each entity or non-entity class, which has limited expressiveness power and even biased representation. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid multi-prototype class representation approach. Specifically, for entity classes, we first insert labels after entities in support sentences to enrich the learned token and label embeddings with more contextual information. Then, for each entity span, the contextual token embeddings are averaged to form its entity-level prototype, while the contextual label embedding is considered as its label-level prototype. The set of prototypes for all entities in a class constitute the multi-prototype of this entity class. For non-entity class, we directly use the set of token embeddings to represent it, where multi-prototype refers to the multiple token embeddings. By treating the entity and non-entity classes differently, our hybrid strategy can extract more precise class representations from the support examples. Furthermore, we establish a harder and more reasonable experimental setting of few-shot NER by offering a rigorous sampling strategy. Extensive empirical results show that our proposal improves F1 scores by 3%â¼10% absolute points over prior models on popular benchmark Few-NERD under both loose and our proposed rigorous sampling constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

In this research, we suggest employing a generative approach using variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can be used specifically to optimize few-shot learning tasks by generating new samples with more intra-class variations on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The purpose of our research is to increase the size of the training dataset using various methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of the few-shot face recognition. Specifically, we employ the VAE generator to increase the size of the training dataset, including the basic and the novel sets while utilizing transfer learning as the backend. Based on extensive experimental research, we analyze various data augmentation methods to observe how each method affects the accuracy of face recognition. The face generation method based on VAEs with perceptual loss can effectively improve the recognition accuracy rate to 96.47% using both the base and the novel sets.",

MetaâââLearning and the DCCMN model are applied to detect frame structure damage under fewâââshot scenarios (Metaâ+âDCCMN). Experiments are conducted on the floor frame structure of Columbia University to validate the effectiveness of this approach.

Meta-learning was proposed to solve difficulties in few-shot learning and fast adaptive areas. Meta-learner learns to remember some common knowledge by training on large scale tasks sampled from a certain data distribution to equip generalization when facing unseen new tasks. Due to the limitation of samples, most approaches only use shallow neural network to avoid overfitting and reduce the difficulty of training process, that causes the waste of many extra information when adapting to unseen tasks. Euclidean space-based gradient descent also make meta-learner's update inaccurate. These issues cause many meta-learning model hard to extract feature from samples and update network parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel method by using multi-stage joint training approach to post the bottleneck during adapting process. To accelerate adapt procedure, we also constraint network to Stiefel manifold, thus meta-learner could perform more stable gradient descent in limited steps. Experiment on mini-ImageNet shows that our method reaches better accuracy under 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot conditions.",

To tackle this, we propose Domain Filtering and Target-Guided Learning (DFTGL). Initially, we measure domain gaps and retain source domains with smaller disparities. We introduce a limited number of target domain samples to create an intermediate domain for better feature transfer during training. Additionally, we employ category-prior-based augmentation to refine feature distribution estimation while ensuring image registration. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in image-level AUROC compared to the baseline: 5.1%, 5.9%, and 4.1% (2-shot, 4-shot, and 8-shot settings) on MVTec and 6.9%, 2.1%, and 2.5% on ViSA datasets. This pioneering research effectively narrows domain gaps, enabling proficient feature transfer, and holds promise for early anomaly detection in industries like product inspection and medical diagnostics.",
