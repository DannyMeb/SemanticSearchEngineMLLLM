Pada tahun 2019 setidaknya terdapat 157.137 hektare hutan dan lahan di Provinsi Jambi terbakar yang menyebabkan kerugian sebesar Rp.12 triliun. Demi mencegah hal tersebut terulang kembali, perlu dilakukan pencegahan dini dengan cara mengelompokkan data titik panas bumi menjadi sejumlah cluster sehingga bisa mengidentifikasi kelompok titik panas mana yang darurat kebakaran. Salah satu metode mengelompokkan titik panas bumi adalah Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering mengelompokkan sejumlah data berdasarkan kemiripan yang membentuk pohon hierarki dari bawah ke atas. Pada penelitian ini, Clustering dilakukan dengan mengelompokkan data menjadi 2 sampai 10 cluster. Evaluasi hasil clustering dilakukan dengan menghitung Silhouette Coefficient dan memilih koefisien yang terbaik dari tiap jumlah cluster. Dengan menggunakan 6.658 row data lalu Confidence, Brightness, dan FRP sebagai atributnya, hasilnya jumlah cluster 2 adalah jumlah cluster terbaik dengan nilai Silhouette Coefficient sebesar 0,5856441. Cluster-1 terdiri dari 6.283 titik dengan rata - rata tingkat kepercayaan 73,49642% yang tergolong sedang, kemudian Cluster-2 terdiri dari 375 titik dengan rata - rata tingkat kepercayaan  99,46133% yang tergolong tinggi sehingga perlu diproritaskan penanggulangannya.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA comparison of neural network clustering (NNC) and hierarchical clustering (HC) is conducted to assess computing dominance of two machine learning (ML) methods for classifying a populous data of large number of variables into clusters. An accurate clustering disposition is imperative to investigate assembly-influence of predictors on a system over a course of time. Moreover, categorically designated representation of variables can assist in scaling down a wide data without loss of essential system knowledge. For NNC, a self-organizing map (SOM)-training was used on a local aqua system to learn distribution and topology of variables in an input space. Ternary features of SOM; sample hits, neighbouring weight distances and weight planes were investigated to institute an optical inference of system’s structural attributes. For HC, constitutional partitioning of the data was executed through a coupled dissimilarity-linkage matrix operation. The validation of this approach was established through a higher value of cophenetic coefficient. Additionally, an HC-feature of stem-division was used to determine cluster boundaries. SOM visuals reported two locations’ samples for remarkable concentration analogy and presence of 4 extremely out of range concentration parameter from among 16 samples. NNC analysis also demonstrated that singular conduct of 18 independent components over a period of time can be comparably inquired through aggregate influence of 6 clusters containing these components. However, a precise number of 7 clusters was retrieved through HC analysis for segmentation of the system. Composing elements of each cluster were also distinctly provided. It is concluded that simultaneous categorization of system’s predictors (water components) and inputs (locations) through NNC and HC is valid to the precision probability of 0.8, as compared to data segmentation conducted with either of the methods exclusively. It is also established that cluster genesis through combined HC’s linkage and dissimilarity algorithms and NNC is more reliable than individual optical assessment of NNC, where varying a map size in SOM will alter the association of inputs’ weights to neurons, providing a new consolidation of clusters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paper tackles the problem of clustering multiple networks, that do not share the same set of vertices, into groups of networks with similar topology. A statistical model-based approach based on a finite mixture of stochastic block models is proposed. A clustering is obtained by maximizing the integrated classification likelihood criterion. This is done by a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm, that starts from singleton clusters and successively merges clusters of networks. As such, a sequence of nested clusterings is computed that can be represented by a dendrogram providing valuable insights on the collection of networks. Using a Bayesian framework, model selection is performed in an automated way since the algorithm stops when the best number of clusters is attained. The algorithm is computationally efficient, when carefully implemented. The aggregation of clusters requires a means to overcome the label-switching problem of the stochastic block model and to match the block labels of the networks. To address this problem, a new tool is proposed based on a comparison of the graphons of the associated stochastic block models. The clustering approach is assessed on synthetic data. An application to a set of ecological networks illustrates the interpretability of the obtained results.",

However, development of un-supervised machine learning algorithms has been a bottleneck of artificial intelligence. Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised task in many different subjects. Unfortunately, no present algorithm is satisfactory for clustering of high dimensional data with strong nonlinear correlations. In this work, we propose a simple and highly efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm based on encoding by composition rank vectors and tree structure, and demonstrate its utility with clustering of protein structural domains. No record comparison, which is an expensive and essential common step to all present clustering algorithms, is involved. Consequently, it achieves linear time and space computational complexity hierarchical clustering, thus applicable to arbitrarily large datasets. The key factor in this algorithm is definition of composition, which is dependent upon physical nature of target data and therefore need to be constructed case by case. Nonetheless, the algorithm is general and applicable to any high dimensional data with strong nonlinear correlations. We hope this algorithm to inspire a rich research field of encoding based clustering well beyond composition rank vector trees.",

        "abstract": "Software applications have become a fundamental part in the daily work of modern society as they meet different needs of users in different domains. Such needs are known as software requirements (SRs) which are separated into functional (software services) and non-functional (quality attributes). The first step of every software development project is SR elicitation. This step is a challenge task for developers as they need to understand and analyze SRs manually. For example, the collected functional SRs need to be categorized into different clusters to break-down the project into a set of sub-projects with related SRs and devote each sub-project to a separate development team. However, functional SRs clustering has never been considered in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to automatically cluster functional requirements based on semantic measure. An empirical evaluation is conducted using four open-access software projects to evaluate our proposal. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach identifies semantic clusters according to well-known used measures in the subject.",

Cell heterogeneity can be explored at different resolutions and the resulted varying cell states are inherently nested. However, most existing single-cell clustering methods output a fixed number of clusters without the hierarchical information. Classical hierarchical clustering provides dendrogram of cells, but cannot scale to large datasets due to the high computational complexity. We present HGC, a fast Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering method to address both problems. It combines the advantages of graph-based clustering and hierarchical clustering. On the shared nearest neighbor graph of cells, HGC constructs the hierarchical tree with linear time complexity. Experiments showed that HGC enables multiresolution exploration of the biological hierarchy underlying the data, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark data, and can scale to large datasets.

        "abstract": "AbstractMany problems in life sciences can be brought back to a comparison of graphs. Even though a multitude of such techniques exist, often, these assume prior knowledge about the partitioning or the number of clusters and fail to provide statistical significance of observed between-network heterogeneity. Addressing these issues, we developed an unsupervised workflow to identify groups of graphs from reliable network-based statistics. In particular, we first compute the similarity between networks via appropriate distance measures between graphs and use them in an unsupervised hierarchical algorithm to identify classes of similar networks. Then, to determine the optimal number of clusters, we recursively test for distances between two groups of networks. The test itself finds its inspiration in distance-wise ANOVA algorithms. Finally, we assess significance via the permutation of between-object distance matrices. Notably, the approach, which we will call netANOVA, is flexible since users can choose multiple options to adapt to specific contexts and network types. We demonstrate the benefits and pitfalls of our approach via extensive simulations and an application to two real-life datasets. NetANOVA achieved high performance in many simulation scenarios while controlling type I error. On non-synthetic data, comparison against state-of-the-art methods showed that netANOVA is often among the top performers. There are many application fields, including precision medicine, for which identifying disease subtypes via individual-level biological networks improves prevention programs, diagnosis, and disease monitoring.",

        "abstract": "AbstractRecent years have seen major changes in the classification criteria and taxonomy of viruses. The current classification scheme, also called “megataxonomy of viruses”, recognizes five different viral realms, defined based on the presence of viral hallmark genes. Within the realms, viruses are classified into hierarchical taxons, ideally defined by their shared genes. Therefore, there is currently a need for virus classification tools based on such shared genes / proteins. Here, VirClust is presented – a novel tool capable of performing i) hierarchical clustering of viruses based on intergenomic distances calculated from their protein cluster content, ii) identification of core proteins and iii) annotation of viral proteins. VirClust groups proteins into clusters both based on BLASTP sequence similarity, which identifies more related proteins, and also based on hidden markow models (HMM), which identifies more distantly related proteins. Furthermore, VirClust provides an integrated visualization of the hierarchical clustering tree and of the distribution of the protein content, which allows the identification of the genomic features responsible for the respective clustering. By using different intergenomic distances, the hierarchical trees produced by VirClust can be split into viral genome clusters of different taxonomic ranks. VirClust is freely available, as web-service (virclust.icbm.de) and stand-alone tool.",

        "abstract": "The identification of regional development gaps is an effort to see how far the development conducted in every District in a Province. By seeing the gaps occurred, it is expected that the Policymakers are able to determine which region that will be prioritized for future development. Along with the regional gaps, the identification in Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) sector is also an effort to identify the achievement in the development in certain fields seen from the potential GRDP owned by a District. There are two approaches that are often used to identify the regional development gaps and potential sector, Klassen Typology and Location Quotient (LQ), respectively. In fact, the results of the identification using these methods have not been able to show the proximity of the development gaps between a District to another yet in a same cluster. These methods only cluster the regions and GRDP sectors in a firm cluster based on their own parameter values. This research develops a new approach that combines the Klassen, LQ and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) into a new method named multi view hierarchical agglomerative clustering (MVHAC). The data of GRDP sectors of 23 Districts in West Java province were tested by using Klassen, LQ, HAC and MVHAC and were then compared. The results show that MVHAC is able to accommodate the ability of the three previous methods into a unity, even to clearly visualize the proximity of the development gaps between the regions and GRDP sectors owned. MVHAC clusters 23 districts into 3 main clusters, they are; Cluster 1 (Quadrant 1) consists of 5 Districts as the members, Cluster 2 (Quadrant 2) consists of 12 Districts and Cluster 3 (Quadrant 4) consists of 6 Districts.",

The gene expression data with a control group from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were used. The optimal cluster number for each clustering technique was obtained using the elbow method and dendrogram for K-means and hierarchical clustering methods respectively. We identified the ideal number of clusters as three and further classified them into seven groups. We observed that the second cluster contains over half the genes in healthy people and the cluster distribution of a healthy patient and a patient who died six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer is similar. Further analysis indicated that of all the time spent by patients after being diagnosed with brain cancer, group 0 has the highest percentage in one month after the diagnosis, while group -2 has the lowest percentage. Most genes shift their clusters when Kmeans and hierarchical clustering techniques we compared with the genes from the control and disease groups. The result of the measure of dissimilarity between the genes expression patterns indicates that the K-means technique outperforms the hierarchical technique with a higher rate of change in the cluster.",

Hal ini membuat pemerintah harus bersiap untuk memanfaatkan kekayaan laut yang dapat membangkitkan industri kelautan dan Perikanan. Sektor kelautan dan Perikanan masuk dalam Program Prioritas nasional yang diharapkan dapat meningkatkan pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional bagi negara. Namun untuk mencapai hal itu, Pemerintah membutuhkan kebijakan di sektor perikanan dan kelautan, tetapi minimnya pengelolaan Klasterisasi potensi perikanan menjadi hambatan bagi pemerintah. Tujuan penelitian yaitu pengelompokkan potensi wilayah produksi perikanan di Indonesia tahun 2021. Penelitian ini membandingkan antara metode klaster hirarki yaitu complete linkage, single linkage, average linkage dan Ward dengan Metode klaster non-hirarki yaitu k-means, k-medoids dan DBSCAN (Density-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise). Penentuan metode terbaik klaster hirarki dan jumlah klaster yang paling optimum  yang terdiri dari average linkage, complete linkage, single linkage dan Ward serta metode Non – hierarchical clustering yaitu K-means dan k-medoids adalah dengan Davies-Bouldin Index (DB), Calinski-Harabasz (CH), Silhouette, dan Dunn Index. Kemudian untuk metode DBSCAN adalah dengan membandingkan nilai Silhouette. Setelah ditentukan jumlah klaster terbaik, maka akan dilakukan evaluasi model dengan nilai  Internal Cluster Dispertion Rate. Model clustering terbaik adalah average linkage dengan nilai Internal Cluster Dispertion Rate paling kecil dibandingkan model cluster lainnya. Maka dapat dilihat provinsi dengan potensi ekonomi kelautan yang paling tinggi dan yang paling rendah. Klaster average linkage menghasilkan 2 klaster. Klaster 1 beranggotakan 30 provinsi dengan potensi ekonomi kelautan yang perlu ditingkatkan. Kemudian klaster 2 yang beranggotakan 4 provinsi dengan potensi ekonomi kelautan yang tinggi.",

Our scheme has the ability to infer a hierarchical structure from the data. It takes a particular relevance when quantitatively analyzing the biological particles of interest at different scales. It assumes a prior neither on the shape of particles nor on the background noise. Our multiscale clustering pipeline is built upon graph theory. At each scale, we first construct a weighted graph that represents the SMLM data. Next, we find clusters using spectral clustering. We then use the output of this clustering algorithm to build the graph in the next scale; in this way, we ensure consistency over different scales. We illustrate our method with examples that highlight some of its important properties.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTBackgroundThe English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is widely used as a measure of deprivation of geographic areas in analyses of health inequalities between places. However, similarly ranked areas can differ substantially in the underlying domains and indicators that are used to calculate the IMD score. These domains and indicators contain a richer set of data that might be useful for classifying local authorities. Clustering methods offer a set of techniques to identify groups of areas with similar patterns of deprivation. This could offer insights into areas that face similar challenges.MethodsHierarchical agglomerative (i.e. bottom-up) clustering methods were applied to sub-domain scores for 152 upper-tier local authorities. Recent advances in statistical testing allow clusters to be identified that are unlikely to have arisen from random partitioning of a homogeneous group. The resulting clusters are described in terms of their subdomain scores and basic geographic and demographic characteristics.ResultsFive statistically significant clusters of local authorities were identified. These clusters represented local authorities that were:Most deprived, predominantly urban;Least deprived, predominantly rural;Less deprived, rural;Deprived, high crime, high barriers to housing; andDeprived, low education, poor employment, poor health.ConclusionHierarchical clustering methods identify five distinct clusters that do not correspond closely to quintiles of deprivation. These methods can be used to draw on the richer set of information contained in the IMD domains and may help to identify places that face similar challenges, and places that appear similar in terms of IMD scores, but that face different challenges.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) utilises the reflectance information of a large number of contiguous spectral bands to solve various problems. However, the relative proximity of spectral signatures among classes can be exploited to generate an adaptive hierarchical structure for HSI classification. This enables a level by level optimisation for clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The Umbrella Clustering algorithm, introduced in this work, utilises this premise to significantly improve performance compared to non-hierarchical algorithms which attempt to optimise clustering globally. The key feature of the proposed methodology is that, unlike existing hierarchical algorithms which rely on fixed or supervised structures, the proposed method exploits a mechanism in spectral clustering to generate a self-organised hierarchy. The algorithm gradually zooms into the feature space to identify levels of clustering at each stage of the hierarchy. The results further demonstrate that the generated structure tallies with human perception. In addition, an improvement to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is also introduced to further improve performance. This modification maximises the pairwise class separation in the feature space. The entire algorithm includes this modified LDA step which requires a certain amount of class information in terms of features, at the training phase. The classification algorithm which incorporates all novel concepts was tested on the HSI data set of Pavia University as well the database of Common Sri Lankan Spices and Adulterants in order to assess the versatility of the algorithm.",

Hydrological signatures are: specific maximum discharge, runoff volume, time to peak, base time, infiltration index and runoff coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical culstering are applied with several distances calculated from these signatures and characteristics. Two clusters are considered for basin regions. Nine distances are compared (euclidean&amp;#160;, Spearman, Cheybechev, cityblock, correlation, cosine, hamming, Jaccard, Minkowsky).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silhouettes values are calculated for each cluster based on the distances calculated. All distances give satisfying results and correlation and Cosine distance give relative best silhouette values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to identify specific cultural segments i.e., clusters within the global market, which could be defined from marketers’ perspective as a zone of cultural homogeneity. It allows marketers to create and apply uniformed marketing program for each segment separately, using the strengths of localization, while maintaining a reasonable level of global approach i.e., optimized glocalization. The segmentation presented in this paper was conducted using the Hierarchical clustering analysis. As a segmentation variable (bases), the Hofstede’s cultural dimensions were applied i.e., power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, long-term orientation, and indulgence. Using statistical measures of the loss of information, six segments were created and described. For the description purposes, the bases were applied as the descriptors were left out of this research, creating the universal bases for future research, and allowing future precisions of these findings.",
