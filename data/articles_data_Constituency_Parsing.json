Our parsers iteratively compose constituent vectors from word embeddings without any grammar constraints. Their empirical complexities are subquadratic. Our extension includes 1) a swap action for the orientation-based binary model and 2) biaffine attention for the chunker-based multi-branching model. In tests conducted with the Discontinuous Penn Treebank and TIGER Treebank, we achieved state-of-the-art discontinuous accuracy with a significant speed advantage.",

        "abstract": "Estimating probability distribution is one of the core issues in the NLP field. \n\nHowever, in both deep learning (DL) and pre-DL eras, unlike the vast applications of linear-chain CRF in sequence labeling tasks, very few works have applied tree-structure CRF to constituency parsing, mainly due to the complexity and inefficiency of the inside-outside algorithm.\n\nThis work presents a fast and accurate neural CRF constituency parser. \n\nThe key idea is to batchify the inside algorithm for loss computation by direct large tensor operations on GPU, and meanwhile avoid the outside algorithm for gradient computation via efficient back-propagation.\n\nWe also propose a simple two-stage bracketing-then-labeling parsing approach to improve efficiency further.\n\nTo improve the parsing performance, inspired by recent progress in dependency parsing, we introduce a new scoring architecture based on boundary representation and biaffine attention, and a beneficial dropout strategy.\n\nExperiments on PTB, CTB5.1, and CTB7 show that our two-stage CRF parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both settings of w/o and w/ BERT, and can parse over 1,000 sentences per second.\n\nWe release our code at https://github.com/yzhangcs/crfpar.",

In this paper, we introduce an unlexicalized transition-based parser for discontinuous constituency structures, based on a structure-label transition system and a bi-LSTM scoring system. We compare it with lexicalized parsing models in order to address the question of lexicalization in the context of discontinuous constituency parsing. Our experiments show that unlexicalized models systematically achieve higher results than lexicalized models, and provide additional empirical evidence that lexicalization is not necessary to achieve strong parsing results. Our best unlexicalized model sets a new state of the art on English and German discontinuous constituency treebanks. We further provide a per-phenomenon analysis of its errors on discontinuous constituents.",

        "abstract": "\n      \n        Sequence-to-sequence constituency parsing casts the tree structured prediction problem as a general sequential problem by top-down tree linearization,and thus it is very easy to train in parallel with distributed facilities. Despite its success, it relies on a probabilistic attention mechanism for a general purpose, which can not guarantee the selected context to be informative in the specific parsing scenario. Previous work introduced a deterministic attention to select the informative context for sequence-to-sequence parsing, but it is based on the bottom-up linearization even if it was observed that top-down linearization is better than bottom-up linearization for standard sequence-to-sequence constituency parsing. In this paper, we thereby extend the deterministic attention to directly conduct on the top-down tree linearization. Intensive experiments show that our parser delivers substantial improvements over the bottom-up linearization in accuracy, and it achieves 92.3 Fscore on the Penn English Treebank section 23 and 85.4 Fscore on the Penn Chinese Treebank test dataset, without reranking or semi-supervised training.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "This chapter shows how a transformational account of ellipsis allows for a sound and complete parsing algorithm which allows for the efficient processing of discourses containing elliptical sentences. In the context of this implementation, two approaches to ellipsis in the transformational community are naturally seen as equivalent descriptions at different levels: the LF-copying approach to ellipsis resolution is best seen as a description of the parser, whereas the phonological deletion approach is a description of the underlying relation between form and meaning. The parsing algorithm result described in this chapter relies not just on formal properties of the grammar formalism (formal universals) but also, crucially, on linguistic assumptions (substantive universals).",

At present there is no obvious way for the issues raised by this research to be framed in terms of an MG parser. Stabler’s 2013 top-down MG parser does not involve any corresponding notion of “retrieval’”: it requires that a phrase’s position in the derivation tree be completely identified before the phrase can be scanned, which means that a filler cannot be scanned without committing to a particular location for its corresponding gap. This chapter attempts to develop a parsing algorithm that is inspired by Stabler, but which allows a sentence-initial filler to be scanned immediately while delaying the choice of corresponding gap position.",

Here, we address one question important for such progress: how can we bring prosody in to inform syntactic parsing of spoken language? We identify and take on two key challenges: (i) explicitly defining aspects of the syntax–prosody interface, including prosodic trees, and (ii) modeling distinct contributions of syntax to conditioning prosodic events, including aspects other than relations between syntactic and prosodic domain edges, such as prosodic reflexes of spell-out. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation of simultaneous (post-)syntactic and prosodic parsing of a Samoan utterance, with syntactic parsing informed by prosody, and prosodic parsing informed by syntax.",

Specifically, this national field experiment shows that for India’s high-level politicians, information on electoral preferences does not affect the willingness of representatives to respond to an individual’s request for assistance. In addition, indications of shared ethnicity, e.g., caste, which may be closely tied to political preferences, do not result in preferential treatment. Overall, these findings offer strong evidence that the aid high-level politicians offer to individuals requiring assistance navigating the state is often noncontingent in nature, taking the form of constituency service.",

It draws on a range of cross-national data to show that the contextual characteristics supporting constituency service—the dynamics of patronage democracy, difficulty in access to public benefits, and partisan allocation of benefits at local levels, accompanied by the presence of high-level representatives with little ability to monitor individual electoral behavior—coexist across a range of democracies around the world. It offers evidence to suggest that high-level politicians in countries across Africa, Asia, and Latin America also engage in individual-level distribution to build a personal vote, rather than support for their party, and that highly partisan distribution by local operatives may ironically heighten their incentives to assist constituents in a nonpartisan manner. Thus, India is an exemplar of a common trend, rather than a global outlier.",

And (2) Will they invest resources in leadership development, and how will that investment be balanced with strategies to mobilize “at scale”? The cases are ISAIAH, a long-standing faith-based community organization in Minnesota, and Indivisible, a new national organization that emerged after the 2016 election.

During the Algerian War, nationalist organizations opposed to the colony’s independence used Toulon as a base for activism, recruitment, and mobilization. When the settlers arrived, the right-wing politicians who governed this city were ready to quit the Gaullist party. After the ex-colonials arrived, they took this step.",

It shows that indicators of a personal vote—that the petitioner has voted for the politician in the past—can have a small positive effect on the quality of a politician’s response, if not the baseline response rate. This chapter also investigates whether information on local blocking affects politicians’ willingness to respond. It shows that, in states with a long history of local elections, politicians interpret information about a failure to receive assistance locally as an indicator of local partisan blocking and, combined with information on electoral history, an indication that the petitioner is a supporter or persuadable voter. Consistent with qualitative evidence from politician shadowing, this experimental evidence substantiates the argument that politicians use constituency service to reach potential supporters.",

While the Minimalist Program has been at the forefront of generative grammar for several decades, it often remains inaccessible to computer scientists and others in adjacent fields. In particular, minimalism reveals a surprising paradox: human language is simpler than we thought, and yet it cannot be processed by the machinery used by computer scientists. In this volume, experts in the field show how to resolve this apparent paradox, and how to turn Chomsky’s abstract theories into working computer programs that can process sentences or make predictions about the time course of brain activity when dealing with language. The book will appeal to graduate students and researchers in formal syntax, computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and computer science.",

        "abstract": "The reading of Coleridge’s “Frost at Midnight” at the center of this chapter opens up the cognitive and aesthetic stakes of seeing writing. It does so by analyzing the encounter with visible script, an experience that can be understood as a reworking of a previously unrecognized source, the scene of writing in David Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 4. Just such an encounter is the activity in play with the figure of the window frost and with the entire poem. Broadly speaking, sentence formation is seen as analogous to frost formation. In this way, the discussion seeks to shift the sensory register of criticism of the poem from its traditional emphasis on the acoustic to a new appreciation of the visible.",

        "abstract": "Constituency service, addressing the nonpolicy grievances of constituents or looking out for their nonpolicy interests, provides legislators an opportunity to enhance their personal reputations. Electoral incentives are the primary explanation suggested for the amount of constituency service carried out by representatives. Variation in electoral rules, such as ballot type and district magnitude, can increase personal vote-seeking incentives, increasing the utility of constituency service as a means of winning re-election. In our opinion, measures of constituency service remain underdeveloped, and while there is widespread agreement on electoral incentives as the key determinant of constituency service, the consequences of constituency service remain elusive.",

Combining information on the costs of holding surgeries and the sponsorship of constituency service EDMs with the fourth wave of the 2015 British Election Study, I find that increased attention to constituency service through more spending on surgeries and sponsoring constituency EDMs helps MPs build positive reputations among citizens as constituent servants.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The objective of the study was to identify the effects of Constituency Development Fund (CDF) on community welfare in Tigania East Constituency.\r\nMethodology: The study adopted descriptive design. The target population was the Constituency Development Fund beneficial groups and project leaders including project management committees (PMCs) of Tigania East Constituency currently implementing projects funded by the CDF. The population comprised of 500 project-member committee drawn from the ongoing CDF-funded projects in Tigania East Constituency. The study employed stratified sampling where the Constituency was divided into Sub Counties. This study utilized a sample size of 100. The study used structured questionnaire and semi structured interviews to collect data. Pilot study was done on ten randomly picked members, two from each sub county and would not participate in the actual study. The researcher used Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version to analyse data. Data analysis employed both descriptive and inferential statistics.\r\nResults: The findings showed that devolved funding has impacted positively on the community welfare of the people of Tigania East constituency. The findings revealed that all the independent variables notably; (X1) youth projects, (X2) health programmes, (X3) infrastructure projects and (X4) educational programmes have a significance influence on community welfare. Youth projects, health programmes, infrastructure projects and educational programmes have p-value of 0.022, 0.004, 0.049, and 0.007 respectively. These p-values are statistically significant at 5% significant level. The study concludes that youth projects, health programmes, infrastructure projects and educational programmes had a significant positive relationship with community welfare in constituency offices. The findings show there are several projects that are being funded/ have been funded by the CDF. It also shows that there are positive outcomes to the community from CDF and that the level of community participation in the projects funded by devolved funds is high.\r\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommends that all stakeholders have to participate in ensuring sustainability of positive strategies adopted in the management of the fund so as to continue realizing their effects. The study also recommends that the national government should fasten the processes leading to disbursement of funds to local units so as not to delay the implementation of projects. The study further recommends that there is the need to train CDF Funds staff as well as the community representatives on issues of project prioritizing, choice and management.",
