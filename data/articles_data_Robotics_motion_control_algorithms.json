        "abstract": "This work proposes the application of several smart strategies for object manipulation tasks. A real-time flexible motion planning method was developed to be adapted to typical in-store logistics scenarios. The solution combines and optimizes some state-of-the-art techniques to solve object recognition and localization problems with a new hybrid pipeline. The algorithm guarantees good robustness and accuracy for object detection through depth images. A standard planner plans collision-free trajectories throughout the whole task while a proposed reactive motion control is active. Distributed proximity sensors were adopted to locally modify the planned trajectory when unexpected or misplaced obstacles intervene in the scene. To implement a robust grasping phase, a novel slipping control algorithm was used. It dynamically computes the grasp force by adapting it to the actual object physical properties so as to prevent slipping. Experimental results carried out in a typical supermarket scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods.",

        "abstract": "Omnidirectional planar robots are common these days due to their high mobility, for example in human–robot interactions. The motion of such mechanisms is based on specially designed wheels, which may vary when different terrains are considered. The usage of actuated caster wheels (ACW) may enable the usage of regular wheels. Yet, it is known that an ACW robot with three actuated wheels needs to overcome kinematic singularities. This paper introduces the kinematic model for an ACW omni robot. We present a novel method to overcome the kinematic singularities of the mechanism’s Jacobian matrix by performing the time propagation in the mechanism’s configuration space. We show how the implementation of this method enables the estimation of caster wheels’ swivel angles by tracking the plate’s velocity. We present the mechanism’s kinematics and trajectory tracking in real-world experimentation using a novel robot design.",

        "abstract": "Microparticles have the potentials to be used for many medical purposes in-side the human body such as drug delivery and other operations. This paper attempts to provide a thorough comparison between five meta-heuristic search algorithms:  Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA), and Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO). These approaches were used to calculate the PID controller optimal indicators with the application of different functions, including Integral Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Time Multiplied by Square Error (ITSE), Integral Square Time multiplied square Error (ISTES), Integral Square Error (ISE), Integral of Square Time multiplied by square Error (ISTSE), and Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute Error (ITAE). Every method of controlling was presented in a MATLAB Simulink numerical model, and LABVIEW software was used to run the experimental tests. It is observed that the MPA technique achieves the highest values of settling error for both simulation and experimental results among other control approaches, while the SSA approach reduces the settling error by 50% compared to former experiments. The results indicate that SSA is the best method among all approaches and that ISTES is the best choice of PID for optimizing the controlling parameters.",

Also, a new approach for high-performance self-tuning nonlinear PID control was developed to track a preselected profile with high accuracy. Moreover, a comparison study between the proposed control technique and the well-known controllers (PID and Nonlinear PID). The optimal control parameters were determined based on the COVID-19 optimization technique. The parameters of the servomechanism system changed randomly at a preselected range through the online simulation. The change of these parameters acts as the nonlinearity resources (friction, backlash, environmental effects) and system uncertainty. A comparative study between the linear and nonlinear models had been accomplished and investigated. The results show that the proposed controller can track several operating points with high accuracy, low rise time, and small overshoot.",

        "abstract": " In this review, we present a comprehensive perspective on communication-aware robotics, an area that considers realistic communication environments and aims to jointly optimize communication and navigation. The main focus of the article is theoretical characterization and understanding of performance guarantees. We begin by summarizing the best prediction an unmanned vehicle can have of the channel quality at unvisited locations. We then consider the case of a single robot, showing how it can mathematically characterize the statistics of its traveled distance until connectivity and further plan its path to reach a connected location with optimality guarantees, in real channel environments and with minimum energy consumption. We then move to the case of multiple robots, showing how they can utilize their motions to enable robust information flow. We consider two specific robotic network configurations—robotic beamformers and robotic routers—and mathematically characterize properties of the co-optimum motion–communication decisions. ",

        "abstract": "India is often described as a country of villages, where a majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. The landscape of Indian agriculture is approximately 159.7 million hectares. Agriculture plays a pivotal role in India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), accounting for about 18% of the nation's economic output. Diseases and pests can have detrimental effects on crops, leading to reduced yields. These challenges can include the spread of plant diseases, infestations by insects or other pests, and the overall degradation of crop health. Early detection of diseases in crops is crucial for several reasons. Detecting diseases at an early stage allows for prompt intervention, such as applying appropriate pesticides or taking preventive measures. The main aim of this study is to develop a highly effective method for plant leaf disease detection using computer vision techniques. Here, leaf disease detection comprises histogram equalization, denoising, image color threshold masking, feature descriptors such as Haralick textures, Hu moments, and color histograms to extract the salient features of leaf images. These features are then used to classify the images by training Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms using K-fold validation. K-fold validation is used to separate the validation samples from the training samples, and the K indicates the number of times this is repeated for the generalization. The training and validation processes are performed in two approaches. The first approach uses default hyperparameters with segmented and non-segmented images. In the second approach, all hyperparameters of the models are optimized to train segmented datasets. The classification accuracy improved by 2.19% by utilizing segmentation and hyperparameter tuning further improved by 0.48%. The highest average classification accuracy of 97.92% is achieved using the Random Forest classifier to classify 40 classes of 10 different plant species. Accurate detection of plant disease leads to the sustained growth of plants throughout the growing span of the plants.",

        "abstract": "Path planning is an essential algorithm to help robots complete their task in the field quickly. However, some path planning algorithms are computationally expensive and cannot adapt to new environments with a distinctly different set of obstacles. This paper presents optimal path planning based on a genetic algorithm (GA) that is proposed to be carried out in a dynamic environment with various obstacles. First, the points of the feasible path are found by performing a local search procedure. Then, the points are optimized to find the shortest path. When the optimal path is calculated, the position of the points on the path is smoothed to avoid obstacles in the environment. Thus, the average fitness values and the GA generation are better than the traditional method. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully finds the optimal path in an environment with multiple obstacles. Compared to a traditional GA-based method, our proposed algorithm has a smoother route due to path optimization. Therefore, this makes the proposed method advantageous in a dynamic environment.",

The object of this research is the algorithmic problems emerging in this area, namely the problem of control over security of algorithms. The study is carried out on the basis of implementation of robotics in military sphere. The analysis of peculiarities of the modern military operations demonstrates that one of the aspects of revolution in military science is the battlefield robotics. However, its realization generates certain issues in legal sphere, related to algorithmic support of the autonomous system. The manifestations of such problem consist in critical use errors, divided by the experts into the errors of first and second grade. The main cause of these errors is the software functionality of the autonomous robotic system. If the consequences for conventional armament are predictable, and the responsibility for their results is determined, the situation in case of implementation of military robots requires solution. Application of the general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis allow examining the main aspects of current state and prospects of the problem of algorithmization with regards to implementation of autonomous systems. The article synthesizes articulation of the scientific tasks aimed at solution of the problem of division of responsibility between the developers and users of similar system in terms of development and testing of the algorithms of their implementation. \n\t",

GAs are a set of interconnected procedures that consist of complex interconnected activity among parameters. When a naive GA practitioner tries to implement GA code, the first question that comes into the mind is what are the value of GA control parameters (i.e., various operators such as crossover probability, mutation probability, population size, number of generations, etc. will be set to run a GA code)? This chapter clears all the complexities about the internal interconnected working of GA control parameters. GA can have many variations in its implementation (i.e., mutation alone-based GA, crossover alone-based GA, GA with combination of mutation and crossover, etc.). In this chapter, the authors discuss how variation in GA control parameter settings affects the solution quality. ",

This study especially set to counter the unstable and inadaptable proportional motions of pneumatic robot grasper towards its environment through the employment of Variable Convergence Rate Prescribed Performance Impedance Control (VPPIC) with pressure-based force estimation (PFE). Impedance control was derived for a single finger of Tri-finger Pneumatic Grasper (TPG) robot, with improvement being subsequently made to the controller’s output by appropriation of formulated finite-time prescribed performance control. Produced responses from exerted pressure of the maneuvered pneumatic piston were then recorded via derived PEE with adherence to both dynamics and geometry of the designated finger. Validation of the proposed method was proceeded on both circumstances of human hand as a blockage and ping-pong ball as methodical representation of a fragile object. Developed findings confirmed relatively uniform force sensing ability for both proposed PEE and load sensor as equipped to the robot’s fingertip with respect to the experimented thrusting and holding of a human hand. Sensing capacity of the estimator has also advanced beyond the fingertip to enclose its finger in entirety. Whereas stable interaction control at negligible oscillation has been exhibited from VPPIC against the standard impedance control towards gentle and compression-free handling of fragile objects. Overall positional tracking of the finger, thus, justified VPPIC as a robust mechanism for smooth operation amid and succeed direct object interaction, notwithstanding its transcendence beyond boundaries of the prescribed performance constraint.     ",

        "abstract": "Motion control in dynamic environments is one of the most important problems in using mobile robots in collaboration with humans and other robots. In this paper, the motion control of a four-Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot (OMR) in dynamic environments is studied. The robot’s differential equations of motion are extracted using Kane’s method and converted to discrete state space form. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is designed based on the derived mathematical model to stabilize the robot in desired positions and orientations. As a main contribution of this work, the velocity obstacles (VO) approach is reformulated to be introduced in the NMPC system to avoid the robot from collision with moving and fixed obstacles online. Considering the robot’s physical restrictions, the parameters and functions used in the designed control system and collision avoidance strategy are determined through stability and performance analysis and some criteria are established for calculating the best values of these parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed controller and collision avoidance strategy is evaluated through a series of computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy is efficient in stabilizing the robot in the desired configuration and in avoiding collision with obstacles, even in narrow spaces and with complicated arrangements of obstacles.",

        "abstract": "The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is widely used in motion control systems due to its simplicity and effectiveness. To achieve satisfactory performance, the PID parameters must be properly tuned. Although numerous PID tuning methods were investigated in the past, most of them were based on either time-domain or frequency-domain responses, while integration of features in both domains for PID tuning was less addressed. However, many industrial practitioners still found it difficult to compromise multiple conflicting control objectives, such as fast responses, small overshoot and tracking errors, and good robustness, with PID controllers. Moreover, it is desirable to adjust PID parameters online such that plant variations and unexpected disturbances can be compensated for more efficiently. In view of these requirements, this paper proposes an adaptive PID control law that updates its parameters online by minimizing the time-domain tracking errors subject to frequency-domain constraints that are imposed for loop shaping. By combining optimization criteria in both time and frequency domains for online parameter adjustment, the proposed PID controller can achieve good tracking performance with adequate robustness margin. Then the proposed PID law is applied to control an XZ-table driven by AC servo motors. Experimental results show that the tracking performance of the proposed controller is superior to that of a constant-gain PID controller whose parameters were tuned by the commercial Matlab/Simulink PID tuner.",
