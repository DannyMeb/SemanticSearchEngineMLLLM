        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe reliance of energy grids to a variety of energy sources leads to complex systems that need to consider multiple parameters in order to optimize the use of their resources as to have the least environmental impact. In this work the authors present a modelling based on statistical analysis and artificial intelligence that aims to predict the energy outcome of renewable energy sources, more specifically wind and solar farms. In the presented paper traditional mathematical/ statistical approaches (like time series through interpolation) are used in combination to Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Thus, by combining the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with mathematical prediction models it is showcased that energy output of these renewable sources can be predicted with great accuracy. In addition, using a combined quasi-AI algorithm consisting of an optimized use of both mathematical and AI models is shown to lead to quickly predicting results for short term energy production with much less computational intensity compared to full AI algorithms, requiring more intensive training. Overall, using the presented models an energy grid can be expected to utilize the potential of its renewable energy sources to the fullest, minimizing dependence on non-renewables and as such the environmental damage they cause.",

        "abstract": "As a matter of facts, real estate price prediction is meaningful for investors. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of multiple real estate price prediction models, including genetic algorithms based on optimization algorithms, random forests based on machine learning, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) based on deep learning. The aim is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these models in terms of predictive accuracy, explanatory power, and computational efficiency. Based on the analysis, genetic algorithms perform well in improving prediction accuracy and model convergence speed, but are sensitive to parameter selection and suffer from overfitting problems. Random forests improve prediction accuracy by integrating multiple decision trees, but are not interpretable enough and are susceptible to data noise. RNN has advantages in processing time series data, but requires a large amount of data and computing resources due to high computational complexity. Although each model has its limitations, it also has great potential. Through methods such as algorithm optimization, model integration, and feature engineering, the accuracy and reliability of real estate price prediction can be further improved. This study not only provides multi-angle model evaluation for real estate price prediction, but also provides development directions for future research.",

Patients with diabetes will lose the ability to effectively regulate blood glucose levels and the disease can lead to increased economic burden for patients and generate enormous public health impact. The main purpose of this paper is to find out the indicators that are highly associated with diabetes and build a model to predict diabetes. The original dataset is from BRFSS (the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System). For this project, a cleaned dataset on Kaggle for the year 2015 was used, which has 253,680 survey responses to CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)'s BRFSS with the target variable diabetes and 21 feature variables. The Chi-square test was applied to investigate the association between feature indicators and diabetes and built several machine learning models for predicting the disease. The selected model is Cat Boost Classifier with 86.6% accuracy for the testing set. According to the Permutation Feature Importance based on the Cat Boost Classifier, the most important 5 features were General Health (GenHlth), BMI (Body Mass Index), Age, high blood pressure (HighBP), and high cholesterol (HighChol) variables.",

        "abstract": "&nbsp;In conjunction with the global concern regarding the spread of fake news on social media, there is a large flow of research to address this phenomenon. The wide growth in social media and online forums has made it easy for legitimate news to merge with comprehensive misleading news, negatively affecting people&rsquo;s perceptions and misleading them. As such, this study aims to use deep learning, pre-trained models, and machine learning to predict Arabic and English fake news based on three public and available datasets: the Fake-or-Real dataset, the AraNews dataset, and the Sentimental LIAR dataset. Based on GloVe (Global Vectors) and FastText pre-trained models, A hybrid network has been proposed to improve the prediction of fake news. In this proposed network, CNN (Convolution Neural Network) was used to identify the most important features. In contrast, BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) was used to measure the long-term dependency of sequences. Finally, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is applied to classify the article news as fake or real. On the other hand, an Improved Random Forest Model is built based on the embedding values extracted from BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) pre-trained model and the relevant speaker-based features. These relevant features are identified by a fuzzy model based on feature selection methods. Accuracy was used as a measure of the quality of our proposed models, whereby the prediction accuracy reached 0.9935, 0.9473, and 0.7481 for the Fake-or-Real dataset, AraNews dataset, and Sentimental LAIR dataset respectively. The proposed models showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting Arabic and English fake news compared to previous studies that used the same datasets.&nbsp;",

Within this context of heightened attention, we propose to utilize machine learning (ML) to optimize and ameliorate pedestrian crossing predictions in intelligent transportation systems, where the crossing process is vital to pedestrian crossing behavior. Compared with traditional analytical models, the application of OpenCV image recognition and machine learning methods can analyze the mechanisms of pedestrian crossing behaviors with greater accuracy, thereby more precisely judging and simulating pedestrian violations in crossing. Authentic pedestrian crossing behavior data were extracted from signalized intersection scenarios in Chinese cities, and several machine learning models, including decision trees, multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian algorithms, and support vector machines, were trained and tested. In comparing the various models, the results indicate that the support vector machine (SVM) model exhibited optimal accuracy in predicting pedestrian crossing probabilities and speeds, and it can be applied in pedestrian crossing prediction and traffic simulation systems in intelligent transportation.",

        "abstract": "Research in model-based reinforcement learning has made significant progress in recent years. Compared to single-agent settings, the exponential dimension growth of the joint state-action space in multi-agent systems dramatically increases the complexity of the environment dynamics, which makes it infeasible to learn an accurate global model and thus necessitates the use of agent-wise local models. However, during multi-step model rollouts, the prediction of one local model can affect the predictions of other local models in the next step. As a result, local prediction errors can be propagated to other localities and eventually give rise to considerably large global errors. Furthermore, since the models are generally used to predict for multiple steps, simply minimizing one-step prediction errors regardless of their long-term effect on other models may further aggravate the propagation of local errors. To this end, we propose Models as AGents (MAG), a multi-agent model optimization framework that reversely treats the local models as multi-step decision making agents and the current policies as the dynamics during the model rollout process. In this way, the local models are able to consider the multi-step mutual affect between each other before making predictions. Theoretically, we show that the objective of MAG is approximately equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the true environment return. Experiments on the challenging StarCraft II benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MAG.",

        "abstract": "The realization of a hydrogen transport network requires the requalification of existing high‐pressure natural gas pipelines and the design and construction of new hydrogen pipelines. Therefore, appropriate design codes are needed, which consider the detrimental effects of gaseous hydrogen on the mechanical properties and ensure a robust, but not too conservative, lifetime concept. For the assessment of hydrogen pipelines, the ASME B31.12 is understood as a benchmark standard. Recently, the technical rule DVGW G 464 (2023) was published in Germany. Both standards consider a fracture mechanics‐based concept, where the pipeline design lifetime is assessed by the hydrogen‐assisted fatigue crack growth of a pre‐existing defect until a defined lifetime criterion is reached. This article compares both concepts within a use case study, where influencing factors on the lifetime predictions are identified and discussed. Relatively similar results are obtained for typical loading scenarios, whereby the ASME B31.12 predicts more allowable cycles compared to the DVGW G 464 mostly arising from a different assumed crack length. To reduce the conservatism, the focus in the design and assessment of hydrogen pipelines should be placed on a detectable small initial crack size and the measurement of material‐specific crack growth curves resulting in pronounced lifetime enhancements.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the acceleration of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays is one of the great challenges of contemporary astrophysics. In this short review, we summarize the general observational constraints on their composition, spectrum and isotropy which indicate that nuclei heavier than single protons dominate their spectra above ˜ 5 EeV, that they are strongly suppressed above energies ˜ 50 EeV, and that the only significant departure from isotropy is a dipole. Constraints based upon photopion and photodisintegration losses allow their ranges and luminosity density to be estimated. Three general classes of source model are discussed - magnetospheric models (including neutron stars and black holes), jet models (including Gamma Ray Bursts, Active Galactic Nuclei and Tidal Disruption Events) and Diffusive Shock Acceleration models (involving large accretion shocks around rich clusters of galaxies). The value of constructing larger and more capable arrays to measure individual masses at the highest energies and probably identifying their sources is emphasized.",

        "abstract": "AbstractOne key aspect in the energy transition is to use the deep geothermal energy stored in sedimentary basins as well as in igneous and metamorphic basement rocks. To estimate the variability of deep geothermal potentials across different geological domains as encountered in the Federal State of Hesse (Germany), it is necessary to understand the driving processes of fluid flow and heat transport affecting subsurface temperature variations. In this study, we quantify the stored energy in a set of geological units in the subsurface of Hesse with the method of “heat in place” (HIP, sensu Muffler and Cataldi in Geothermics 7:53–89, 1978)—HIP is one proxy for the geothermal potential of these units controlled by their temperature configuration as derived from a series of coupled 3D thermo-hydraulic numerical models. We show how conductive, advective and convective heat transport mechanisms influence the thermal field and thereby the HIP calculations. The heterogeneous geology of the subsurface of Hesse ranges from locally outcropping Paleozoic basement rocks to up to 3.8 km thick Cenozoic, porous sedimentary deposits in the tectonically active northern Upper Rhine Graben. The HIP was quantified for five sedimentary layers (Cenozoic, Muschelkalk, Buntsandstein, Zechstein, Rotliegend) as well as for the underlying basement. We present a set of maps allowing to identify geothermally prospective subregions of Hesse based on the laterally varying thermal energy stored within the units. HIP is predicted to be highest in the area of the northern Upper Rhine Graben in the Cenozoic unit with up to 700 GJ $$\\text {m}^{-2}$$\n\nm\n\n-\n2\n\n\n and in the Rotliegend with up to 617 GJ $$\\text {m}^{-2}$$\n\nm\n\n-\n2\n\n\n. The calculations account for the variable thicknesses and temperatures of the layers, density and heat capacity of the solid and fluid parts of the rocks as well as porosity.",

        "abstract": "Network Pruning is a promising way to address the huge computing resource demands of the deployment and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). Retraining-free is important for LLMs' pruning methods. However, almost all of the existing retraining-free pruning approaches for LLMs focus on unstructured pruning, which requires specific hardware support for acceleration. In this paper, we propose a novel retraining-free structured pruning framework for LLMs, named FLAP (FLuctuation-based Adaptive\nStructured Pruning). It is hardware-friendly by effectively reducing storage and enhancing inference speed. For effective structured pruning of LLMs, we highlight three critical elements that demand the utmost attention: formulating structured importance metrics, adaptively searching the global compressed model, and implementing compensation mechanisms to mitigate performance loss. First, FLAP determines whether the output feature map is easily recoverable when a column of weight is removed, based on the fluctuation pruning metric. Then it standardizes the importance scores to adaptively determine the global compressed model structure. At last, FLAP adds additional bias terms to recover the output feature maps using the baseline values. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on a variety of language benchmarks. Without any retraining, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including LLM-Pruner and the extension of Wanda in structured pruning.

The approach utilizes the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), borrowed from software engineering, to create a Platform-Independent Model (PIM) saved in a graph database, neo4j. The PIM is then transformed into Platform-Specific Model (PSM) using cypher queries. Finally, from the PSM, a Pandapower network is generated that is used later for running power flow simulations. The Common Information Model (CIM) ontology classes, which form the metamodel behind CGMES, are loaded into the same database, connecting them to the grid instances, allowing for automatic validation and inference. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to large-scale real-world grids that include renewable energy sources.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the photovoltaic (PV) industry has grown rapidly and the scale of grid-connected PV continues to increase. The random and fluctuating nature of PV power output is beginning to threaten the safe and stable operation of the power system. PV power interval forecasting can provide more comprehensive information to power system decision makers and help to achieve risk control and risk decision. PV power interval forecasting is of great importance to power systems. Therefore, in this study, a Quantile Regression-Stacking (QR-Stacking) model is proposed to implement PV power interval prediction. This integrated model uses three models, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and categorical boosting (CatBoost), as the base learners and Quantile Regression-Long and Short Term Memory (QR-LSTM) model as the meta-learner. It is worth noting that in order to determine the hyperparameters of the three base learners and one meta-learner, the optimal hyperparameters of the model are searched using a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) optimization algorithm based on Bayesian ideas. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient is applied to determine the input characteristics of the model. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified using the actual data of a PV plant in China.",

Borrowing strategies from Li/Na metal anodes, the three-dimensional (3D)-structured current collector has proven to be a universal and effective strategy. This study examines the recent research progress of 3D-structured electrodes for K metal anodes, focusing on the most commonly used host materials, including carbon-, metal-, and MXene-related electrode materials.

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction: The current fleet of nuclear reactors in the United States is mandated to provide evidence that surrounding jurisdictions can screen their populations should an incident occur. Capacity can be measured as throughput in reception centers used for screening. Due to the significant staffing and resources required to exercise screening capacity, most jurisdictions typically perform smaller exercises and use models to estimate their overall throughput. Objective: To evaluate the applicability and realism of current throughput models and practices. Methods: Throughput capacity for radiation screening is estimated with a mathematical model derived by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a discrete event simulation model as a tool, SimPLER, to evaluate capacity and make throughput predictions. Model estimates will be compared and evaluated using timing data collected at a large-scale exercise. Results: The FEMA model estimated a throughput 41.2% higher than the actual radiation screening throughput, while the SimPLER model provided identical values. The FEMA and SimPLER models’ predicted throughputs were 50% and 3.8%, respectively, higher than total exercise throughput. Applying each model to the throughput projections for a 12-hour shift, the FEMA model estimates ranged from 665 to 6,646 people and the SimPLER model yielded an estimated throughput of 1,809 people with a standard deviation of 74.6. Conclusion: Discrete event simulation models, such as SimPLER, may provide more realistic and accurate predictions of radiation screening and throughput capacity of reception centers than mathematical models such as the FEMA model.",

        "abstract": "Determining the aero-icing characteristics is key for safety assurance in aviation, but it may be a computationally expensive task. This work presents a framework for the development of low-dimensional models for application to aerofoil icing. The framework builds on: an adaptive sampling strategy to identify the local, nonlinear features across the icing envelope for continuous intermittent icing; a classic technique based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, and a modern Neural Network architecture. The extreme diversity in simulated ice shapes, from smooth and streamlined to rugged and irregular shapes, motivated the use of an unsupervised classification of the ice shapes. This allowed deploying the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition locally within each sub-region, sensibly improving the prediction accuracy over the global model. On the other hand, the Neural Network architecture and the convolutional auto-encoder were found insensitive to the complexity in ice shapes. A strong correlation was found to exist between the ice shape, resulting ice mass and aerodynamic performance of the iced aerofoil, both in terms of the average and variance. On average, rime ice causes a loss of maximum lift coefficient of 21.5% compared to a clean aerofoil, and the average ice thickness is 0.9% of the aerofoil chord. For glaze ice, the average loss of maximum lift coefficient is 46.5% and the average ice thickness is 2.1%. Glaze ice was also found to have three times more surface coverage than rime ice.",

        "abstract": "In drug discovery, compounds with well-defined activity against multiple targets (multitarget compounds, MT-CPDs) provide the basis for polypharmacology and are thus of high interest. Typically, MT-CPDs for polypharmacology have been discovered serendipitously. Therefore, over the past decade, computational approaches have also been adapted for the design of MT-CPDs or their identification via computational screening. Such approaches continue to be under development and are far from being routine. Recently, different machine learning (ML) models have been derived to distinguish between MT-CPDs and corresponding compounds with activity against the individual targets (single-target compounds, ST-CPDs). When evaluating alternative models for predicting MT-CPDs, we discovered that MT-CPDs could also be accurately predicted with models derived for corresponding ST-CPDs; this was an unexpected finding that we further investigated using explainable ML. The analysis revealed that accurate predictions of ST-CPDs were determined by subsets of structural features of MT-CPDs required for their prediction. These findings provided a chemically intuitive rationale for the successful prediction of MT-CPDs using different ML models and uncovered general-feature subset relationships between MT- and ST-CPDs with activities against different targets.",

        "abstract": "For power system operation and expansion of grid-import systems, an accurate forecast model plays an essential role in the better management of household electricity demands. With the aim of finding an accurate forecast model in the proper representation of various household energy profiles, our research objective is centered on the development of a reliable forecast system for a group of 24-household energy consumers. In this energy study, we proposed long-term forecasts of (1) residential energy profiles within the multi-classification framework and (2) energy costing of the household demands using the Keras two-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv2D) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. These high-level Keras neural networks are built to extract multivariate features for household energy consumption modeling and forecasting. The proposed forecast systems utilized a similar model hyperparameter configuration, while the forecast skills are validated with spatial–temporal variation datasets of ten remote locations. The actual costs of household demand and supply are estimated and compared with Conv2D predictions. The finding results (hourly and seasonal predictions and model evaluation) revealed that Conv2D and LSTM forecast systems are promising for household energy forecast solutions. Experimental results of the Conv2D predictive system achieved better forecast skills [correlation coefficient (0.727–0.994) and root mean square error (0.190–0.868)] than LSTM forecasts (0.308–0.987 and 0.278–1.212). However, experimental findings revealed that forecast skills of the predictive systems in residential energy demand predictions are highly influenced by the (1) quality of input datasets, (2) model hyperparameter tuning approach, and (3) learning rate of selected network optimizer(s).",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe appearance of large language models (LLMs) and other forms of generative AI portend a new era of disruption and innovation for the news industry, this time focused on the production and consumption of news rather than on its distribution. Large news organizations, however, may be surprisingly well‐prepared for at least some of this disruption because of earlier innovation work on automating workflows for personalized content and formats using structured techniques. This article reviews this work and uses examples from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and other large news providers to show how LLMs have recently been successfully applied to addressing significant barriers to the deployment of structured approaches in production, and how innovation using structured techniques has more generally framed significant editorial and product challenges that might now be more readily addressed using generative AI. Using the BBC's next‐generation authoring and publishing stack as an example, the article also discusses how earlier innovation work has influenced the design of flexible infrastructure that can accommodate uncertainty in audience behavior and editorial workflows – capabilities that are likely to be well suited to the fast‐approaching AI‐mediated news ecosystem.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the demand and requirement for renewable energy have significantly increased due to concerns regarding energy security and the climate crisis. This has led to a significant focus on wind power generation. As the deployment of wind turbines continues to rise, there is a growing need to assess their lifespan and improve their stability. Access to accurate load data is crucial for enhancing safety and conducting remaining life assessments of wind turbines. However, maintaining and ensuring the reliability of measurement systems for long-term load data accumulation, stability assessments, and residual life evaluations can be challenging. As a result, numerous studies have been conducted on load prediction for wind turbines. However, existing load prediction models based on 10 min statistical data cannot adequately capture the short-term load variations experienced by wind turbines. Therefore, it is essential to develop models capable of predicting load with a high temporal resolution to enhance reliability, especially with the increasing scale and development of floating wind turbines. In this paper, we developed prediction models with a 50 Hz resolution for the bending strain at the tower bottom of offshore wind turbines by combining SCADA data and acceleration data using machine learning techniques and analyzed the results. The load prediction models demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error below 4%.",

        "abstract": "We have developed an innovative workflow, Stability, Transport, Equilibrium, and Pedestal (STEP)-zero-dimensional (0D), within the OMFIT integrated modeling framework. Through systematic validation against the International Tokamak Physics Activity global H-mode confinement database, we demonstrated that STEP-0D, on average, predicts the energy confinement time with a mean relative error of less than 19%. Moreover, this workflow showed promising potential in predicting plasmas for proposed fusion reactors such as the affordable, robust, compact (ARC) reactor, the European demonstration power plant (EU-DEMO), and the China fusion engineering test reactor (CFETR) indicating moderate H-factors between 0.9 and 1.2. STEP-0D allows theory-based prediction of tokamak scenarios, beginning with 0D quantities. The workflow initiates with the PRO-create module, generating physically consistent plasma profiles and equilibrium using the same 0D quantities as the IPB98(y,2) confinement scaling. This sets the starting point for the STEP module, which further iterates between theory-based physics models of equilibrium, core transport, and pedestal to yield a self-consistent solution. Given these attributes, STEP-0D not only improves the accuracy of predicting plasma performance but also provides a path toward a novel fusion power plant design workflow. When integrated with engineering and costing models within an optimization, this new approach could eliminate the iterative reconciliation between plasma models of varying fidelity. This potential for a more efficient design process underpins STEP-0D's significant contribution to future fusion power plant development.",

        "abstract": "Infinite nuclear matter is a suitable laboratory to learn about nuclear forces in many-body systems. In particular, modern theoretical predictions of neutron-rich matter are timely because of recent and planned experiments aimed at constraining the equation of state of isospin-asymmetric matter. For these reasons, we have taken a broad look at the equation of state of neutron-rich matter and the closely related symmetry energy, which is the focal point of this article. Its density dependence is of paramount importance for a number of nuclear and astrophysical systems, ranging from neutron skins to the structure of neutron stars. We review and discuss ab initio predictions in relation to recent empirical constraints. We emphasize and demonstrate that free-space nucleon–nucleon data pose stringent constraints on the density dependence of the neutron matter equation of state, which essentially determines the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing and understanding the electricity consumption of end users, especially the anomalies (outliers), are vital for the planning, operation, and management of the power grid. It will help separate the group of users with unpredictable consumption behavior and then develop and train specialized deep learning models for power load forecasting or regular and non-regular users. The aim of the current work is to divide electricity customers into numerous groups based on anomalies in consumption behavior and major clusters. Successful separation of such groups of customers will provide us with two advantages. One is the increase in the accuracy of load forecasting of other users or groups of users due to their predictable consumption behavior. The second is the opportunity to develop and train specialized deep learning models for customers with highly unpredictable behaviors. The novelty of the work is the segregation of anomalous electricity users from normal/regular users based on outliers in their past power consumption behavior over a period of 92 days. Results indicate that almost 85 percent of the users in the selected residential community attribute one major cluster in their consumption behavior over a period of 3 months of data (92 days). It is also evident from the results that only a small proportion of customers, i.e., 10 out of 69 customers (15 percent), have either more than one cluster or attribute no cluster (zero clusters), which is highly important and indicates that these are the possible users who cause higher variations in power consumption of the residential community.",

We present results from a 2D illustrative experiment and image experiments and demonstrate that for the first time for image data, persistently trained EBMs can simultaneously achieve long‐run stability, post‐training image generation and superior out‐of‐distribution detection.",

As an application, we focus on Horndeski theories, using the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) to parametrize linear and quasi-non-linear perturbations. In the non-linear regime, we investigate both a non-linear parametrized post-Friedmann (nPPF) approach as well as a physically motivated and approximate phenomenological model based on the error function (Erf). We compare the parametrized approaches’ predictions of the non-linear matter power spectrum to the exact solutions, as well as state-of-the-art emulators, in an evolving dark energy scenario and two well-studied modified gravity models, finding sub-per cent agreement in the reaction using the Erf model at z ≤ 1 and k ≤ 5 h Mpc−1. This suggests only an additional three free constants, above the background and linear theory parameters, are sufficient to model non-linear, non-standard cosmology in the matter power spectrum at scales down to k ≤ 3h Mpc−1 within $2{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ accuracy. We implement the parametrizations into ver.2.0 of the ReACT code: ACTio et ReACTio.",

Whilst existing studies have compared different creep models using different measures of predictive performance, none have identified whether these differences are real from a statistical significance perspective. This paper proposes several tests based on a review of the literature. These tests were applied to two creep models using failure time data on 2.25Cr–1Mo steel to develop a recommended approach for practitioners to adopt when selecting a creep model. All such tests concluded that the Evans model produced better long-term life predictions using only short-term data, and that this difference was statistically significant at the 5% significance level.

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nLong-distance rafting on anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) is thought to have a significant impact on global marine biogeography and the dispersal of non-indigenous species. Therefore, early identification of arrival sites of AMD and its epibionts is crucial for the prioritization of preventive measures. As accumulation patterns along global coastlines are largely unstudied, we tested if existing oceanographic models and knowledge about upstream sources of litter and epibionts can be used as a simple and cost-efficient approach for predicting probable arrival sites of AMD-rafting biota in coastal zones.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing the Southeast Pacific as a model system, we studied daily accumulation rates, composition, and minimum floating times of AMD with and without epibionts on seven sandy beaches, covering the oceanic environment (Rapa Nui/Easter Island) and three regions (south, centre, north) along the Chilean continental coast, over a minimum of 10 consecutive days, and we contrast our results with predictions from published models.\n\n\nResults\nTotal AMD accumulation rates varied from 56 ± 36 (mean ± standard deviation) to 388 ± 433 items km−1 d−1 and differed strongly between regions, in accordance with local geomorphology and socioeconomic conditions (presence of larger cities and rivers upstream, main economic activities, etc.). Daily accumulation of items with pelagic epibionts (indicators of a pelagic trajectory) ranged from 46 ± 29 (Rapa Nui) to 0.0 items km−1 d−1 (northern continental region). Minimum floating times of rafts, as estimated from the size of pelagic epibionts, were longest in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre’s (SPSG) centre region, followed by the high-latitude continental region under the influence of the onshore West Wind Drift, and decreased along the continental alongshore upwelling current, towards lower latitudes. Apart from pelagic rafters, a wide range of benthic epibionts, including invasive and cryptogenic species, was found on rafts at the continental beaches. Similarly, we present another record of local benthic corals Pocillopora sp., on Rapa Nui rafts.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur results agree with the predictions made by recent models based on the prevailing wind and surface current regimes, with high frequencies of long-distance rafting in the oceanic SPSG centre and very low frequencies along the continental coast. These findings confirm the suitability of such models in predicting arrival hotspots of AMD and rafting species. Moreover, storm surges as well as site-related factors seem to influence AMD arrival patterns along the Chilean continental coast and might cause the observed high variability between sampling sites and days. Our results highlight the possible importance of rafting as a vector of along-shore dispersal and range expansions along the SE Pacific continental coast and add to the discussion about its role in benthic species dispersal between South Pacific oceanic islands.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis study proposes a new hybrid model for monthly streamflow predictions by coupling a physically based distributed hydrological model with a deep learning (DL) model. Specifically, a simplified hydrological model is first developed by optimally selecting grid cells from a distributed hydrological model according to their soil moisture characteristics. It is then driven by bias corrected general circulation model (GCM) predictions to generate soil moistures for the forecasting months. Finally, model‐simulated soil moisture along with other predictors from multiple sources are used as inputs of the DL model to predict future monthly streamflows. The proposed hybrid model, using the simplified Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) as the hydrological model and the combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN‐GRU) as the DL model, is applied to predict 1‐, 3‐, and 6‐month ahead reservoir inflows for the Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. The results show that the hybrid model consistently performs better than VIC and CNN‐GRU models with great improvement in Kling‐Gupta efficiency (KGE) values for lead times up to 6 months. Additional tests indicate that hybrid models based on CNN‐GRU outperform those based on LASSO, XGBoost, CNN, and GRU models. Moreover, compared with the distributed hydrological model, the hybrid model greatly reduces the computation burden of rolling prediction. It also saves decision‐makers the time and effort of trying different combinations of predictors, which is indispensable when building DL models. Overall, the new hybrid model demonstrates great potential for monthly streamflow prediction where training data are limited.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn order to face the challenges of energy transition, turbomachinery designers claim for appropriate numerical tools able to keep up with robust, and fast design iterations.\nHigh fidelity analyses are becoming feasible for assessing the performance of selected geometries, however RANS-based CFD codes are still the workhorse exploited for daily design and optimization iterations when a large number of geometrical configurations are needed to scrutinize a wide and complex design space. The proper selection of the numerical framework, and in particular of the turbulence model, is always critical in order to guarantee a sufficient confidence level in the predicted results, and, at the same time, robustness and numerical stability with quick simulations. Major sources of inaccuracy are often associated with 3D flow features, secondary flows, flow separations, and shock wave boundary layer interaction.\nThe present work proposes helicity-based corrections for the production terms of two-equation turbulence models as a mean of improving predictions of the aforementioned flow features. A discussion on the treatment of helicity-based terms when changing frame of reference represents one novelty aspect of the paper.\nThe numerical framework is first validated on a transonic axial fan test case (NASA Rotor 67) and then applied to the analysis of two centrifugal compressor stages for in the high peripheral Mach number regime.\nThe feasibility of the helicity-based approach is proven via a comparison with the available experimental data in terms of spanwise distributions of flow quantities and performance characteristics of work input and polytropic efficiency. The impact of turbulence modeling on the prediction of the flow field details is investigated, to assess the capability of a steady state numerical approach to identify the physical mechanisms that limit the operating range at low mass flows.",

        "abstract": "In demography, mortality modeling with respect to age and time dimensions is often associated with the traditionally used Lee-Carter model. The Lee-Carter model considers a constant set of parameters of agespecific mortality change for forecasts, which can lead to the problem of overcoming the biodemographic limit. The main motivation of this paper is the use of more flexible models for mortality modeling. The paper explores the use of state space models for modeling and predicting mortality in a form not typically used in demography. In this context, it is a generalized Poisson state space model with overdispersion parameters. Concerning the empirical results, a comparison is made between the predictive abilities of the Lee-Carter and the generalized Poisson state space model with overdispersion parameters. The state space Poisson model with overdispersion parameters led to better results with respect to the comparison of modeled and historical observations. However, when comparing the predictions in the cross-validation area, both models were represented with similar overall mean squared error.",

The system’s low-cost nature and operational convenience make it accessible for widespread use. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is conducted to identify regions susceptible to severe landslide disasters, providing valuable insights for risk assessment. Our findings underscore the efficacy of this system in facilitating a qualitative analysis of landslide-prone areas, offering a swift and cost-efficient solution for the three-dimensional reconstruction of slope models.",

        "abstract": "In the history of the gold market, contemporary gold prices are higher than the previous values, and the current gold market is highly non-linear and unpredictable. Gold is the most popular precious metal for investment out of all the precious metals. The gold market, like other markets, is vulnerable to speculation and volatility. Gold has served as a secure base in several countries when compared to other precious metals used for investment. In this study, we suggest a time series model for predicting daily variations in the amount of gold per gram in Indian rupees. To increase the forecasting accuracy, we use a hybrid prediction method known as the Grey-Fourier Markov model which includes Grey models (GM), Fourier series, and Markov state transition. Here, we divide the forecasting process into three steps. The first step is to simulate the data of daily volatile price of gold using GM (1, 1), GM (2, 1), and Grey Verhulst models and also to calculate corresponding residual errors. In the second step, we utilize the residual error produced by the above grey models to predict the trend of the gold price with the help of the Fourier series and Markov Model. In the third step, we use hybrid grey models to improve the precision. Finally, we conclude that the proposed methodology outperforms the aforementioned strategies in terms of results.",

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Burn injuries range from minor medical issues to severe, life-threatening conditions. The severity and location of the burn dictate its treatment; while minor burns might be treatable at home, severe burns necessitate medical intervention, sometimes in specialized burn centers with extended follow-up care. This study aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to forecast potential adverse effects in burn patients. Methods: This retrospective analysis considered burn patients admitted to Chi Mei Medical Center from 2010 to 2019. The study employed 14 features, comprising supplementary information like prior comorbidities and laboratory results, for building models for predicting graft surgery, a prolonged hospital stay, and overall adverse effects. Overall, 70% of the data set trained the AI models, with the remaining 30% reserved for testing. Three ML algorithms of random forest, LightGBM, and logistic regression were employed with evaluation metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: In this research, out of 224 patients assessed, the random forest model yielded the highest AUC for predictions related to prolonged hospital stays (>14 days) at 81.1%, followed by the XGBoost (79.9%) and LightGBM (79.5%) models. Besides, the random forest model of the need for a skin graft showed the highest AUC (78.8%), while the random forest model and XGBoost model of the occurrence of adverse complications both demonstrated the highest AUC (87.2%) as well. Based on the best models with the highest AUC values, an AI prediction system is designed and integrated into hospital information systems to assist physicians in the decision-making process. Conclusions: AI techniques showcased exceptional capabilities for predicting a prolonged hospital stay, the need for a skin graft, and the occurrence of overall adverse complications for burn patients. The insights from our study fuel optimism for the inception of a novel predictive model that can seamlessly meld with hospital information systems, enhancing clinical decisions and bolstering physician–patient dialogues.",

        "abstract": "Amid global climate change urgency, accurate model predictions are paramount for informed interventions. However, the disparity among prediction models highlights a pressing research gap requiring a deeper and more comprehensive comparison of the differences and consistency of the different models in climate change prediction. This research undertook a comprehensive analysis of 18 CMIP-6 models, aiming to provide a comprehensive comparison and cohesive prediction of ice mass and ice area from 1960 to 2050. The models consistently forecast a substantial decline in Arctic ice coverage and volume. Without marked reductions in carbon emissions, Arctic glaciers are projected to vanish entirely by the close of the century. Furthermore, the correlation analysis results indicate that there is a significant interdependence between sea ice area and sea ice mass was observed, with Pearson R2 approximately 0.908. Notably, models varied regarding the precise year of the Arctic's complete ice loss, spotlighting the inherent uncertainties of current predictions and the pressing need for mitigation measures. The study illuminates the pressing urgency for a globally coordinated response to carbon emissions and serves as a clarion call for enhanced research into the intricacies of climate change and glacier melting processes to refine future predictions.",

For this purpose, this research has used a data set covering the 2012–2018 period for a reference hospital, which includes energy-related and nonenergy-related variables.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results demonstrate that environmental efficiency based on energy reached the highest level in the winter months, whereas the summer months have the lowest efficiency values arising from the increasing electricity consumption due to high cooling needs. According to results of the non-oriented SBM model, the month with the highest efficiency in all periods is January with a 0.936 average efficiency score, the lowest month is August with a 0.406 value.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper differs from other studies related to energy and environmental efficiencies in the literature with some aspects. First, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first one that takes into account time periods (months and years) as (DMUs for a single organization. Second, this study investigates environmental nonefficiencies, which are derived from energy uses and factors affecting energy use.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurately predicting post-critical heat flux (CHF) heat transfer is an important but challenging task in water-cooled reactor design and safety analysis. Although numerous heat transfer correlations have been developed to predict post-CHF heat transfer, these correlations are only applicable to relatively narrow ranges of flow conditions due to the complex physical nature of the post-CHF heat transfer regimes. In this paper, a large quantity of experimental data is collected and summarized from the literature for steady-state subcooled and low-quality film boiling regimes with water as the working fluid in vertical tubular test sections. A low-quality water film boiling (LWFB) database is consolidated with a total of 22,813 experimental data points, which cover a wide flow range of the system pressure from 0.1 to 9.0 MPa, mass flux from 25 to 2750 kg/m2 s, and inlet subcooling from 1 to 70 °C. Two machine learning (ML) models, based on random forest (RF) and gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT), are trained and validated to predict wall temperatures in post-CHF flow regimes. The trained ML models demonstrate significantly improved accuracies compared to conventional empirical correlations. To further evaluate the performance of these two ML models from a statistical perspective, three criteria are investigated and three metrics are calculated to quantitatively assess the accuracy of these two ML models. For the full LWFB database, the root-mean-square errors between the measured and predicted wall temperatures by the GBDT and RF models are 5.7% and 6.2%, respectively, confirming the accuracy of the two ML models.",

        "abstract": " We provide predictions for DSGE models with incomplete information that are robust across information structures. Our approach maps an incomplete-information model into a full-information economy with time-varying expectation wedges and provides conditions that ensure the wedges are rationalizable by some information structure. Using our approach, we quantify the potential importance of information as a source of business cycle fluctuations in an otherwise frictionless model. Our approach uncovers a central role for firm-specific demand shocks in supporting aggregate confidence fluctuations. Only if firms face unobserved local demand shocks can confidence fluctuations account for a significant portion of the US business cycle. (JEL D82, D83, E13, E31, E32) ",

        "abstract": "AbstractA novel framework for the automated evaluation of various deep learning-based splice site detectors is presented. The framework eliminates time-consuming development and experimenting activities for different codebases, architectures, and configurations to obtain the best models for a given RNA splice site dataset. RNA splicing is a cellular process in which pre-mRNAs are processed into mature mRNAs and used to produce multiple mRNA transcripts from a single gene sequence. Since the advancement of sequencing technologies, many splice site variants have been identified and associated with the diseases. So, RNA splice site prediction is essential for gene finding, genome annotation, disease-causing variants, and identification of potential biomarkers. Recently, deep learning models performed highly accurately for classifying genomic signals. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and its bidirectional version (BLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and its bidirectional version (BGRU) are promising models. During genomic data analysis, CNN’s locality feature helps where each nucleotide correlates with other bases in its vicinity. In contrast, BLSTM can be trained bidirectionally, allowing sequential data to be processed from forward and reverse directions. Therefore, it can process 1-D encoded genomic data effectively. Even though both methods have been used in the literature, a performance comparison was missing. To compare selected models under similar conditions, we have created a blueprint for a series of networks with five different levels. As a case study, we compared CNN and BLSTM models’ learning capabilities as building blocks for RNA splice site prediction in two different datasets. Overall, CNN performed better with $$92\\%$$\n\n92\n%\n\n accuracy ($$6\\%$$\n\n6\n%\n\n improvement), $$89\\%$$\n\n89\n%\n\n F1 score ($$8\\%$$\n\n8\n%\n\n improvement), and $$96\\%$$\n\n96\n%\n\n AUC-PR ($$4\\%$$\n\n4\n%\n\n improvement) in human splice site prediction. Likewise, an outperforming performance with $$96\\%$$\n\n96\n%\n\n accuracy ($$11\\%$$\n\n11\n%\n\n improvement), $$94\\%$$\n\n94\n%\n\n F1 score ($$16\\%$$\n\n16\n%\n\n improvement), and $$99\\%$$\n\n99\n%\n\n AUC-PR ($$7\\%$$\n\n7\n%\n\n improvement) is achieved in C. elegans splice site prediction. Overall, our results showed that CNN learns faster than BLSTM and BGRU. Moreover, CNN performs better at extracting sequence patterns than BLSTM and BGRU. To our knowledge, no other framework is developed explicitly for evaluating splice detection models to decide the best possible model in an automated manner. So, the proposed framework and the blueprint would help selecting different deep learning models, such as CNN vs. BLSTM and BGRU, for splice site analysis or similar classification tasks and in different problems.",
