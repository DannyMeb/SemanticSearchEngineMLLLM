        "abstract": "This paper presents a deep learning algorithm for the diagnosis of eye diseases, which is taken from cats and dogs, using data augmentation. The database of eye images was collected from cell phone cameras, and with data augmentation techniques were used to increase the number of samples. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated on the original dataset of 146 diseased and 255 healthy images. The results showed that the VGG16 algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 99.25% before data augmentation, which was significantly higher than the accuracy of existing methods. Furthermore, after the data augmentation again VGG16 model has significant performance metrics that are 99.9% than other algorithms. The proposed algorithm can be used to accurately diagnose various eye diseases, which can potentially improve the quality of care for patients.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rise in interest in face anti-spoofing (FAS) owing to the critical function it plays in protecting face recognition systems against presentation assaults (PAs). Early-stage FAS approaches relying on handmade characteristics become inaccurate when steadily realistic PAs of unique sorts emerge. Thus, face anti-spoofing algorithms are gaining increasing relevance in such setups. A very innovative method called deep learning has shown remarkable success in difficult computer vision problems. The proposed method uses deep acquisition and transfer of learning to extract characteristics from people’s faces. This is why the authors of this study recommend using the Faster RCNN classifier with a face-liveness detection approach. Two distinct components— the data augmentation module for assessing sparse information as well as the faster RCNN classifier module— make up the anti-spoofing approach. We may use any publicly accessible dataset to train our quicker RCNN classifier. We successively fused these two components and used the Android platform to create a basic face recognition app. The results of the tests demonstrate that the developed module can identify several types of face spoof assaults, such as those carried out with the use of posters, masks, or cell phones. Testing the proposed architecture both across and inside databases using three benchmarking (Idiap Replay Attack, CASIA- FASD, & 3DMAD) demonstrate its ability to deliver outcomes on par with cutting-edge techniques.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning technology is widely used for recognizing character images, including various regional characters and diverse ancient scripts. Deep learning models require large data sets to recognize images accurately. However, creating a dataset has limitations in terms of quantity, including the Komering script dataset used in this study. Data augmentation techniques can be applied to expand the dataset by modifying existing images to increase data diversity. This study aims to investigate the impact of augmentation techniques on the performance of deep learning models in the case of Komering script recognition. The dataset consists of 500 images for five classes of Komering script characters. Three augmentation techniques, namely random rotation, height shift, and width shift, were applied to the five characters, which were then used to test the model trained to recognize characters in the Komering dataset. This research contributes to providing insights into the effect of augmentation techniques on robust confidence prediction of deep learning models for recognizing newly augmented data. The results demonstrate that the deep learning model can recognize modified data using augmentation techniques with an average accuracy of 80.05%.",

        "abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and other forms of distance learning have gained popularity in recent years. The success of remote online exam proctoring determines the integrity of the exam. Deep-learning-powered proctoring services have also grown in popularity. A large number of samples are needed for deep-learning training. The network’s generalization ability is poor due to insufficient training data or an uneven lack of variation. This study illustrates how to analyze students’ anomalous behavior by utilizing a YOLOv5 deep model trained using newly produced dataset. To overcome insufficient training data for deep-learning-related issues, this paper proposes a data-augmentation method based on semantic segmentation. The MobileNetV3 model was used to get an image semantic segmentation mask, which was used to get a binary mask, which in turn was used to replace the image background by using conditional subtraction with randomly selected background images. Finally, randomly pixel-based color augmentation was added to the resulting image. The behavioral detection model used in this study achieved 0.98 mean average precision (mAP) on the produced dataset, showing acceptable detection precision. The experimental findings indicate that the suggested augmentation method improves behavioral detection precision by more than 0.3%.",

As of 2021, over 16 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with some type of cognitive impairment. The goal of this paper is to find the most effective set of data augmentations to correctly classify cognitive diseases with deep networks, using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. This paper demonstrates a Greedy optimization technique to find the most effective sequence of data augmentations out of blurring, distortion, position, and red noise (an overlay augmentation displaying random clouds of noise on the images). We sought to classify 3 tumors: glioma tumors, pituitary tumors, and meningioma tumors, as well as detect if there was no tumor at all. We also classified 3 stages of Alzheimer's disease: not demented, very mildly demented, and mildly demented, to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the data augmentation sequence.  ",

        "abstract": "Malaria is an infection caused by the Plasmodium parasite that has a major epidemiological, social, and economic impact worldwide. Conventional diagnosis of the disease is based on microscopic examination of thick blood smears. This analysis can be time-consuming, which is key to generate prevention strategies and adequate treatment to avoid the complications associated with the disease. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning-based approach to detect not only malaria parasites but also leukocytes to perform parasite/μL blood count. We used positive and negative images with parasites and leukocytes. We performed data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset. The YOLOv8 algorithm was used for model training and using the counting formula the parasites were counted. The results showed the ability of the model to detect parasites and leukocytes with 95% and 98% accuracy, respectively. The time spent by the model to report parasitemia is significantly less than the time spent by malaria experts. This type of system would be supportive for areas with poor access to health care. We recommend validation of such approaches on a large scale in health institutions.",

        "abstract": "In essence, smart grids are electrical networks that transmit and distribute electricity in a reliable, effective manner using information and communication technology (ICT). Trust and security are of the utmost importance. False data injection (FDI) attacks are one of the most serious new security problems, and they can drastically raise the price of the energy distribution process. However, rather than smart grid infrastructures, the majority of current research focuses on FDI defenses for conventional electricity networks. By utilizing spatial-temporal correlations between grid components, we create an effective and real-time technique to identify FDI attacks in smart grids called a deep learning framework. We show that the suggested method offers an accurate and dependable solution using realistic simulations based on the smart grid compared to the benchmarked techniques.",

Although humans can easily recognize common objects, such as cars, animals, or plants, performing this task on a large scale can be time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, automating this process using neural networks can save time and effort while achieving higher accuracy. Our study focuses on the classification step of human chromosome karyotyping, an important medical procedure that helps diagnose genetic disorders. Traditionally, this task is performed manually by expert cytologists, which is a time-consuming process that requires specialized medical skills. Therefore, automating it through deep learning can be immensely useful. To accomplish this, we implemented and adapted existing preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to prepare the chromosome images for classification. We used ResNet-50 convolutional neural network and Swin Transformer, coupled with an ensemble approach to classify the chromosomes, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in the tested dataset.",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is a promising technique in improving exploration and convergence speed in deep reinforcement learning methodologies. In this work, we propose a data augmentation framework based on generative models for creating completely novel states and increasing diversity. For this purpose, a diffusion model is used to generate artificial states (learning the distribution of original, collected states), while an additional model is trained to predict the action executed between two consecutive states. These models are combined to create synthetic data for cases of high and low immediate rewards, which are encountered less frequently during the agent’s interaction with the environment. During the training process, the synthetic samples are mixed with the actually observed data in order to speed up agent learning. The proposed methodology is tested on the Atari 2600 framework, producing realistic and diverse synthetic data which improve training in most cases. Specifically, the agent is evaluated on three heterogeneous games, achieving a reward increase of up to 31%, although the results indicate performance variance among the different environments. The augmentation models are independent of the learning process and can be integrated to different algorithms, as well as different environments, with slight adaptations.",

        "abstract": "The increasing trend in deep generative modelling, which offers data scarcity and diversity solutions in machine learning, is one of the most recent developments in the field. The data-oriented approaches drive the need for the quality and variety of data sets that could be prevented due to privacy issues and limited resources. Generative deep models, basically GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Automatic Encoders), appear to be the most reliable approach to the synthesis and augmentation of the data. These models employ deep learning to basically learn all by itself from raw data without anyone teaching it, which is the basis of modern artificial intelligence. Accuracy issues between overfitting and poor generalization emphasize the need for smart solutions to the problem of data shortness. Deep generative modelling works based on the data distribution, which the model learns by itself and enables a realistic sample generator. The study reviews the proficiency and complexity of GANs, VAEs, and WGANs, comparing the WGANs' capabilities with the former two. Techniques of data augmentation, e.g., repositioning, rotation, and adding Gaussian noise to the dataset, will greatly increase the diversity of the data. Regardless of the training time, all models showcase competitive inference performance and, as a result, may be satisfactorily used in real-time operations. The insights obtained shed light on ways to improve machine learning and artificial intelligence through brain data synthesis, model training, and computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Big data applications are consuming most of the space in industry and research area. Among the widespread examples of big data, the role of video streams from CCTV cameras is equally important as other sources like social media data, sensor data, agriculture data, medical data and data evolved from space research. Surveillance videos have a major contribution in unstructured big data. CCTV cameras are implemented in all places where security having much importance. Manual surveillance seems tedious and time consuming. Security can be defending in different terms in different contexts like theft identification, violence detection, chances of explosion etc. In crowded public places the term security covers almost all type of abnormal events. Among them violence detection is difficult to handle since it involves group activity. The anomalous or abnormal activity analysis in a crowd video scene is very difficult due to several real world constraints. The paper includes a deep rooted survey which starts from object recognition, action recognition, crowd analysis and finally violence detection in a crowd environment. Majority of the papers reviewed in this survey are based on deep learning technique. Various deep learning methods are compared in terms of their algorithms and models. The main focus of this survey is application of deep learning techniques in detecting the exact count, involved persons and the happened activity in a large crowd at all climate conditions. Paper discusses the underlying deep learning implementation technology involved in various crowd video analysis methods. Real time processing, an important issue which is yet to be explored more in this field is also considered. Not many methods are there in handling all these issues simultaneously. The issues recognized in existing methods are identified and summarized. Also, future direction is given to reduce the obstacles identified. The survey provides a bibliographic summary of papers from Science-direct, IEEE Xplore and ACM digital library.",

In this study, rainfall nowcasting has been studied utilizing NASA Giovanni satellite-derived precipitation products and the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) approach. The goal of the study is to assess the impact of data augmentation on flood nowcasting. Due to data requirements of deep learning-based prediction methods, data augmentation is performed using eight different interpolation techniques. Spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal interpolated rainfall data are used to conduct a comparative analysis of the results obtained through nowcasting rainfall. This research examines two catastrophic floods that transpired in Türkiye Marmara Region in 2009 and the Central Black Sea Region in 2021, which are selected as the focal case studies. The Marmara and Black Sea regions are prone to frequent flooding, which, due to the dense population, has devastating consequences. Furthermore, these regions exhibit distinct topographical characteristics and precipitation patterns, and the frontal systems that impact them are also dissimilar. The nowcast results for the two regions exhibit a significant difference. Although data augmentation significantly reduced the error values by 59% for one region, it did not yield the same effectiveness for the other region.",

Three-dimensional human skeleton data extracted from the Kinect depth sensor have emerged as a powerful alternative to mitigate the effects of lighting and occlusion of traditional 2D RGB or grayscale image-based HAR. Data augmentation is a key technique to enhance model generalization and robustness in deep learning while suppressing overfitting to training data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of various data augmentation techniques specific to skeletal data, which aim to improve the accuracy of deep learning models. These augmentation methods include spatial augmentation, which generates augmented samples from the original 3D skeleton sequence, and temporal augmentation, which is designed to capture subtle temporal changes in motion. The evaluation covers two publicly available datasets and a proprietary dataset and employs three neural network models. The results highlight the impact of temporal augmentation on model performance on the skeleton datasets, while exhibiting the nuanced impact of spatial augmentation. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring augmentation strategies to specific dataset characteristics and actions, providing novel perspectives for model selection in skeleton-based human action recognition tasks.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.",

Aiming at the problem of overfitting deep learning models due to the small number of EEG signal data during epilepsy detection, this paper proposes an epilepsy detection method that combines data augmentation and deep learning.MethodsFirst, the Adversarial and Mixup Data Augmentation (AMDA) method is used to realize the data augmentation, which effectively enriches the number of training samples. To further improve the classification accuracy and robustness of epilepsy detection, this paper proposes a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit (AM-1D CNN-GRU) network model based on attention mechanism for epilepsy detection.Results and discussionThe experimental results show that the performance of epilepsy detection achieved by using augmented data is significantly improved, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the subject’s working characteristic curve are up to 96.06, 95.48%, and 0.9637, respectively. Compared with the non-augmented data, all indicators are increased by more than 6.2%. Meanwhile, the detection performance was significantly improved compared with other epilepsy detection methods. The results of this research can provide a reference for the clinical application of epilepsy detection.",

        "abstract": "Gastric cancer is a significant health concern, particularly in Korea, and its accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. However, a gastroscopic biopsy can be time-consuming and may, thus, delay diagnosis and treatment. Thus, this study proposed a gastric cancer diagnostic method, CADx, to facilitate a more efficient image analysis. Owing to the challenges in collecting medical image data, small datasets are often used in this field. To overcome this limitation, we used AutoAugment’s ImageNet policy and applied cut-and-paste techniques using a sliding window algorithm to further increase the size of the dataset. The results showed an accuracy of 0.8317 for T-stage 1 and T-stage 4 image classification and an accuracy of 0.8417 for early gastric cancer and normal image classification, indicating improvements of 7 and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, through the application of test-time augmentation to the early gastric cancer and normal image datasets, the image classification accuracy was improved by 5.8% to 0.9000. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation methods for enhancing gastric cancer classification performance.",

        "abstract": "With the increase in the volume of news articles and headlines being generated, it is becoming more difficult for individuals to keep up with the latest developments and find relevant news articles in the Kurdish language. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation approach for improving the performance of Kurdish news headline classification using back-translation and a proposed deep learning Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model. The approach involves generating synthetic training data by translating Kurdish headlines into a target language in this context English language and back-translating them to the Kurdish language, resulting in an augmented dataset. The proposed BiLSTM model is trained on the augmented data and compared with baseline models SVM (Support-Vector-Machines) and Naïve Bayes an trained on the original data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BiLSTM model outperforms the baseline model and other existing models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Kurdish news headline classification task. The findings suggest that the combination of back-translation and a proposed BiLSTM model is a promising approach for data augmentation in low-resource languages, contributing to the advancement of natural language processing in under-resourced languages. Moreover, having a Kurdish news headline classification model can improve access to news and information for Kurdish speakers. With the classification model, they can easily and quickly search for news articles that interest them based on their preferred categories, such as politics, sports, or entertainment.",

        "abstract": " Cost-sensitive classification is critical in applications where misclassification errors widely vary in cost. However, overparameterization poses fundamental challenges to the cost-sensitive modeling of deep neural networks (DNNs). The ability of a DNN to fully interpolate a training data set can render a DNN, evaluated purely on the training set, ineffective in distinguishing a cost-sensitive solution from its overall accuracy maximization counterpart. This necessitates rethinking cost-sensitive classification in DNNs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cost-sensitive adversarial data augmentation (CSADA) framework to make overparameterized models cost sensitive. The overarching idea is to generate targeted adversarial examples that push the decision boundary in cost-aware directions. These targeted adversarial samples are generated by maximizing the probability of critical misclassifications and used to train a model with more conservative decisions on costly pairs. Experiments on well-known data sets and a pharmacy medication image (PMI) data set, made publicly available, show that our method can effectively minimize the overall cost and reduce critical errors while achieving comparable overall accuracy.

The deep learning models implemented are non-hybrid: Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and, hybrid: CNN+GRU, CNN+ LSTM and LSTM+GRU. Since most of the dataset prediction features are of the nominal type (true false), this paper proposes a simple novel data augmentation technique for this type of features. Taking as inspiration the input data type of a neural network, the proposal data augmentation technique considers nominal features as numeric, and obtain random values close to them to generate synthetic records. The results show that most of deep learning models with data augmentation significantly outperform models without data augmentation in terms of accuracy, precision, f1-score and specificity, being the main improvements of 17.39%, 66.67%, 25.00% and 25.00% respectively.",

        "abstract": "The application of Deep Neural Networks to detect intracranial hemorrhage from computed tomography images has been widely used in clinical medicine. In general, building these solutions combines three types of approaches: Preprocessing, Transfer Learning, and Data Augmentation. This study’s goal was to measure the contribution of each of these approaches and thus highlight which approach has more margin of improvement. An experimental study was conducted on a public dataset containing computerized tomography images. The comparison used the stratified ten-fold cross-validation process to set confidence intervals evaluating performance measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The ResNet-50 was the deep learning model selected. The results showed that all the approaches raise the generalization power when applied in isolation, and Data Augmentation offers the most significant gain to the baseline. The experiment also showed an opportunity to improve the detection of intracranial hemorrhage by applying new preprocessing techniques since this was the approach that showed the smallest increase in discriminatory power among the investigated approaches. The paired Wilcoxon’s Signed-Rank Test showed that not all the differences were statistically significant, with a confidence level of 95%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMotor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years thanks to their potential to enhance rehabilitation and control of prosthetic devices for individuals with motor disabilities. However, accurate classification of motor imagery signals remains a challenging task due to the high inter-subject variability and non-stationarity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In the context of MI-BCIs, with limited data availability, the acquisition of EEG data can be difficult. In this study, several data augmentation techniques have been compared with the proposed data augmentation technique adaptive cross-subject segment replacement (ACSSR). This technique, in conjunction with the proposed deep learning framework, allows for a combination of similar subject pairs to take advantage of one another and boost the classification performance of MI-BCIs. The proposed framework features a multi-domain feature extractor based on common spatial patterns with a sliding window and a parallel two-branch convolutional neural network. The performance of the proposed methodology has been evaluated on the multi-class BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a through repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental results indicated that the implementation of the ACSSR method (80.47%) in the proposed framework has led to a considerable improvement in the classification performance compared to the classification without data augmentation (77.63%), and other fundamental data augmentation techniques used in the literature. The study contributes to the advancements for the development of effective MI-BCIs by showcasing the ability of the ACSSR method to address the challenges in motor imagery signal classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is an important procedure in deep learning. GAN-based data augmentation can be utilized in many domains. For instance, in the credit card fraud domain, the imbalanced dataset problem is a major one as the number of credit card fraud cases is in the minority compared to legal payments. On the other hand, generative techniques are considered effective ways to rebalance the imbalanced class issue, as these techniques balance both minority and majority classes before the training. In a more recent period, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are considered one of the most popular data generative techniques as they are used in big data settings. This research aims to present a survey on data augmentation using various GAN variants in the credit card fraud detection domain. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive summary of several peer-reviewed research papers on GAN synthetic generation techniques for fraud detection in the financial sector. In addition, this survey includes various solutions proposed by different researchers to balance imbalanced classes. In the end, this work concludes by pointing out the limitations of the most recent research articles and future research issues, and proposes solutions to address these problems.",

Empirical results show that our technique not only maintains classification accuracy in high-quality images but also significantly improves it when given noisy inputs without increasing the training time. This advancement demonstrates the potential of our approach for augmenting data for deep learning models to perform effectively in production under varied and suboptimal conditions.",

        "abstract": "Diagnosing knee joint osteoarthritis (KOA), a major cause of disability worldwide, is challenging due to subtle radiographic indicators and the varied progression of the disease. Using deep learning for KOA diagnosis requires broad, comprehensive datasets. However, obtaining these datasets poses significant challenges due to patient privacy and data collection restrictions. Additive data augmentation, which enhances data variability, emerges as a promising solution. Yet, it’s unclear which augmentation techniques are most effective for KOA. Our study explored data augmentation methods, including adversarial techniques. We used strategies like horizontal cropping and region of interest (ROI) extraction, alongside adversarial methods such as noise injection and ROI removal. Interestingly, rotations improved performance, while methods like horizontal split were less effective. We discovered potential confounding regions using adversarial augmentation, shown in our models’ accurate classification of extreme KOA grades, even without the knee joint. This indicated a potential model bias towards irrelevant radiographic features. Removing the knee joint paradoxically increased accuracy in classifying early-stage KOA. Grad-CAM visualizations helped elucidate these effects. Our study contributed to the field by pinpointing augmentation techniques that either improve or impede model performance, in addition to recognizing potential confounding regions within radiographic images of knee osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "The interest in Deep Learning (DL) has seen an exponential growth in the last ten years, producing a significant increase in both theoretical and applicative studies. On the one hand, the versatility and the ability to tackle complex tasks have led to the rapid and widespread diffusion of DL technologies. On the other hand, the dizzying increase in the availability of biomedical data has made classical analyses, carried out by human experts, progressively more unlikely. Contextually, the need for efficient and reliable automatic tools to support clinicians, at least in the most demanding tasks, has become increasingly pressing. In this survey, we will introduce a broad overview of DL models and their applications to biomedical data processing, specifically to medical image analysis, sequence processing (RNA and proteins) and graph modeling of molecular data interactions. First, the fundamental key concepts of DL architectures will be introduced, with particular reference to neural networks for structured data, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial models, and siamese architectures. Subsequently, their applicability for the analysis of different types of biomedical data will be shown, in areas ranging from diagnostics to the understanding of the characteristics underlying the process of transcription and translation of our genetic code, up to the discovery of new drugs. Finally, the prospects and future expectations of DL applications to biomedical data will be discussed.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeep learning models produce impressive results in any natural language processing applications when given a better learning strategy and trained with large labeled datasets. However, the annotation of massive training data is far too expensive, especially in the legal domain, due to the need for trained legal professionals. Data augmentation solves the problem of learning without labeled big data. In this paper, we employ pre-trained language models and prompt engineering to generate large-scale pseudo-labeled data for the legal overruling task using 100 data samples. We train small recurrent and convolutional deep-learning models using this data and fine-tune a few other transformer models. We then evaluate the effectiveness of the models, both with and without data augmentation, using the benchmark dataset and analyze the results. We also test the performance of these models with the state-of-the-art GPT-3 model under few-shot setting. Our experimental findings demonstrate that data augmentation results in better model performance in the legal overruling task than models trained without augmentation. Furthermore, our best-performing deep learning model trained on augmented data outperforms the few-shot GPT-3 by 18% in the F1-score. Additionally, our results highlight that the small neural networks trained with augmented data achieve outcomes comparable to those of other large language models.",

        "abstract": "Automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms are used to classify a given synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into one of the known target classes by using the information gleaned from a set of training images that are available for each class. Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art classification accuracy if abundant training data are available, especially if they are sampled uniformly over the classes and in their poses. In this paper, we consider the ATR problem when a limited set of training images are available. We propose a data-augmentation approach to incorporate SAR domain knowledge and improve the generalization power of a data-intensive learning algorithm, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed data-augmentation method employs a physics-inspired limited-persistence sparse modeling approach, which capitalizes on the commonly observed characteristics of wide-angle synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Specifically, we fit over-parametrized models of scattering to limited training data, and use the estimated models to synthesize new images at poses and sub-pixel translations that are not available in the given data in order to augment the limited training data. We exploit the sparsity of the scattering centers in the spatial domain and the smoothly varying structure of the scattering coefficients in the azimuthal domain to solve the ill-posed problem of the over-parametrized model fitting. The experimental results show that, for the training on the data-starved regions, the proposed method provides significant gains in the resulting ATR algorithm’s generalization performance.",

The model is a popular method for real-time object detection, accuracy, and speed. However, since the videos obtained from the cattle herd consist of free space images, the number of frames in the data is unbalanced. This negatively affects the performance of the YOLOv5 model. First, we investigate the model performance on the unbalanced initial dataset obtained from raw images, then we stabilize the initial dataset using some data augmentation methods and obtain the model performance. Finally, we built the target detection model and achieved excellent model performance with an mAP (mean average precision) of 99.5% on the balanced dataset compared to the model on the unbalanced data (mAP of 95.8%). The experimental results show that YOLO v5s has a good potential for automatic cattle identification, but with the use of data augmentation methods, superior performance can be obtained from the model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being used for data monitoring and collection purposes. Typically, they consist of a large number of sensor nodes that are used remotely to collect data about the activities and conditions of a particular area, for example, temperature, pressure, motion. Each sensor node is usually small, inexpensive, and relatively easy to deploy compared to other sensing methods. For this reason, WSNs are used in a wide range of applications and industries. However, WSNs are vulnerable to different kinds of security threats and attacks. This is primarily because they are very limited in resources like power, storage, bandwidth, and processing power that could have been used in developing their defense. To ensure their security, an effective Intrusion detection system (IDS) need to be in place to detect these attacks even under these constraints. Today, traditional IDS are less effective as these malicious attacks are becoming more intelligent, frequent, and complex. Denial of service (DOS) attack is one of the main types of attacks that threaten WSNs. For this reason, we review related works that focus on detecting DoS attacks in WSN. In addition, we developed and implemented several Deep learning (DL) based IDS. These systems were trained on a specialized dataset for WSNs called WSN-DS in detecting four types of DoS attacks that affects WSNs. They include the Blackhole, Grayhole, Flooding, and Scheduling attacks. Finally, we evaluated and compared the results and we discuss possible future works.",

        "abstract": "The extent of myocardial infarction (MI) can be evaluated thanks to delayed enhancement (DE) cardiac MRI. DE MRI is an imaging technique acquired several minutes after the injection of a contrast agent where MI appears with a bright signal. The automatic myocardium segmentation in DE MRI is quite challenging, especially when MI is present, since these areas usually showcase a heterogeneous aspect in terms of shape and intensity, thus obstructing the myocardium visibility. To overcome this issue, we propose an image processing-based data augmentation algorithm where diverse synthetic cases of MI were created in two different ways: fixed and adaptive. In the first one, the training set is enlarged by a specific factor, whereas in the second, the method receives feedback from the segmentation model during training and performs the augmentation exclusively on complex cases. The method performance was evaluated in single and multi-modality settings. In this latter, information from kinetic images (Cine MRI), which are acquired along DE MRI in the same examination, is also used, and the extracted features from both modalities are fused. The results show that applying the data augmentation in a fixed fashion on a multi-modality setting leads to a more consistent segmentation of the myocardium in DE MRI. The segmentation models, which were all UNet-based architectures, can better relate MI areas with the myocardium, thus increasing its overall robustness to pathology-specific local pattern perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nData is one of the most important limiting factors of deep machine learning (ML) model in drilling applications. Though a big size of historical data can be available, high-quality cleaned and labeled data is usually limited. In this case study, we show that with limited labeled data, physics-based data augmentation combined with unsupervised learning significantly improves both stability and accuracy in bit wear ML model. It provides a pathway to overcome labeled data shortage and field data quality limitations.\nLabeled bit wear data is usually limited because only the final bit dull state can be labeled using dull photos for the entire drilling distance. To overcome this difficulty, an encoder-decoder unsupervised ML framework based on Bi-directional LSTM architecture is first applied to the data of entire drilling distance to extract and maximize data learnings. Then, a physics-based wear estimator is implemented in the learned latent space to augment labeled wear dataset, guided by true wear labels and offset-well data. Weighting factor in loss function is applied to optimize augmented and true datasets in final supervised learning step.\nThe proposed real-time bit wear model is built on a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning method. The model is applied on multiple field bit runs. Results show that by implementing the unsupervised data learnings only, the prediction accuracy is improved by 30% compared to the baseline ML model. By combining physics-based augmentation, the accuracy is further improved by 10%. More importantly, adding physics-based data augmentation significantly reduces prediction variance and unphysical wear outputs, therefore improving prediction stability by more than 30%. It should be noted that the prediction stability of AI/ML model is crucial in real-time application and decision making. The results show physics-based data augmentation not only increases the size of label dataset and prevents model overfitting, but also applies physics-based guidance to the ML model effectively. It is learned weighting factor plays a crucial role in balancing loss contributions from true wear labels and physics-based labels. While low weighting factor of physics-based labels diminishes the augmented data, high weighting factor disrespects the true wear labels leading to a high prediction bias. Overall, the bit wear model study shows physic-based data augmentation combined with unsupervised data learning can effectively improve model accuracy, stability, and overcome labeled data shortage difficulty.\nThe proposed paper shows a case study for the bit wear ML model using a combination of physics-based data augmentation and unsupervised data learning. While labeled data is one of the major challenges of ML models in many drilling applications, this study provides a pathway to improve both accuracy and stability of deep ML models with limited labeled data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe academic intervention to predict at-risk higher education (HE) students requires effective data model development. Such data modelling projects in the HE context may have common issues related to (a) adopting small-scale modelling that gives limited options for early intervention and (b) using imbalanced data that hinders capturing effective details of poorly performing students. We address the issues going beyond the distribution-based algorithm, using a multilayer perceptron classifier which shows better on confusion metric, recall, and precision measures for identifying at-risk students. Our proposed deep learning-based model, which uses data augmentation techniques to supplement the data instances and balance the dataset, aims to improve the prediction accuracy of whether the student will fail or not based on their interaction with the learning management systems to prevent struggling students from evasion.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become widely popular and are extensively used for various sensor communication applications due to their flexibility and cost effectiveness, especially for applications where localization is a main challenge. Furthermore, the Dv-hop algorithm is a range-free localization algorithm commonly used in WSNs. Despite its simplicity and low hardware requirements, it does suffer from limitations in terms of localization accuracy. In this article, we develop an accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based range-free localization for WSN applications in the Internet of things (IoT). To improve the localization performance, we exploit a deep neural network (DNN) to correct the estimated distance between the unknown nodes (i.e., position-unaware) and the anchor nodes (i.e., position-aware) without burdening the IoT cost. DL needs large training data to yield accurate results, and the DNN is no stranger. The efficacy of machine learning, including DNNs, hinges on access to substantial training data for optimal performance. However, to address this challenge, we propose a solution through the implementation of a Data Augmentation Strategy (DAS). This strategy involves the strategic creation of multiple virtual anchors around the existing real anchors. Consequently, this process generates more training data and significantly increases data size. We prove that DAS can provide the DNNs with sufficient training data, and ultimately making it more feasible for WSNs and the IoT to fully benefit from low-cost DNN-aided localization. The simulation results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed (Dv-hop with DNN correction) surpasses that of Dv-hop.",

Abiotic and biotic factors such as precipitation, soil fertility, temperature, pests, bacteria, and viruses, among others, impact the yield production and quality of rice grain. Farmers spend a lot of time and money managing diseases, and they do so using a bankrupt \"eye\" method that leads to unsanitary farming practices. The development of agricultural technology is greatly conducive to the automatic detection of pathogenic organisms in the leaves of rice plants. Several deep learning algorithms are discussed, and processors for computer vision problems such as image classification, object segmentation, and image analysis are discussed. The paper showed many methods for detecting, characterizing, estimating, and using diseases in a range of crops. The methods of increasing the number of images in the data set were shown. Two methods were presented, the first is traditional reinforcement methods, and the second is generative adversarial networks.

        "abstract": " Estimating porosity from seismic data is critical for studying underground rock properties, assessing energy reserves, and subsequent reservoir exploration and development. For reservoirs with strong heterogeneity, the endeavor to accurately and stably characterize spatial variations in porosity often encounters considerable challenges due to the rapid lateral changes of formations. In view of this, establishing a robust mapping relationship from seismic data to reservoir properties in three-dimensional (3D) space is important in addressing this challenge. We propose to transform the conventional one-dimensional (1D) sequence-to-point (STP) prediction paradigm into a 3D sequence-to-sequence (STS) prediction paradigm to enable machine learning to extract 3D seismic data features. 3D STS prediction presents valuable potential for enhancing the geological continuity and vertical characterization ability of porosity compared to STP. Building upon the 3D STS prediction model, three strategies from different perspectives are introduced to further enhance the performance of seismic porosity estimation. First, we apply a translation-based data augmentation (DA) strategy to mitigate the problem of sparsely labeled data. Second, we propose spatial constraints (SC) considering absolute coordinates and relative time to boost the spatial delineation of porosity. Third, to incorporate geological insights into machine learning, we impose geologic constraints (GC) by measuring the data distribution similarity between around-the-well predictions and well labels. Compared with data augmentation strategies, incorporating spatial constraints and geologic constraints to STS yields more substantial improvements, which illustrates the importance of prior knowledge for physical parameter inversion. Finally, the combined application of these three strategies and the 3D STS method gives better generalization performance and geological plausibility in the porosity prediction for investigated carbonate reservoirs, outperforming other methods, and decreasing error by an average of 8% across 48 wells compared to STP.

The results show that data augmentation has a positive impact on improving emotion classification accuracy. Techniques such as noising, pitching, stretching, shifting, and speeding are applied to increase data variation and overcome class imbalance. The 1D CNN model with data augmentation achieved 94.5% accuracy, while the transformer model with data augmentation performed even better at 97.5%. This research is expected to contribute better insights for the development of accurate emotion recognition methods by using data augmentation with these models to improve classification accuracy on the RAVDESS dataset. Further research can explore larger and more diverse datasets and alternative model approaches.",

        "abstract": "Drone object detection is one of the main applications of image processing technology and pattern recognition using deep learning. However, the limited drone image data that can be accessed for training detection algorithms is a challenge in the development of drone object detection technology. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to increase the amount of drone image data using data augmentation techniques. This study aims to evaluate the effect of data augmentation on deep learning accuracy in drone object detection using the YOLOv5 algorithm. The methods used in this research include collecting drone image data, augmenting data with rotate, crop and cutout, training the YOLOv5 algorithm with and without data augmentation, as well as testing and analyzing training results.The results of the study show that data augmentation can't improve the accuracy of the YOLOv5 algorithm in drone object detection. Evidenced by the decreasing value of precision and mAP@0.5 and the relatively constant value of recall and F-1 score. This is caused by too much augmentation can cause loss of important information in the data and improper augmentation can cause noise or distortion in the data.",

        "abstract": "Coastal areas that are rich in shrimp natural resources usually have a strong fishing industry. Shrimp consumption can contribute to the local economy. Several types of shrimp have higher utilization potential in the fishing industry and human consumption. Classification helps sort out shrimp species in coastal waters. Deep learning technology helps identify and separate shrimp species through deep learning with the Convolutional neural network. The seven classes observed were Vaname Shrimp, Tiger Shrimp, Jerbung Shrimp, Giant Prawns, Red Shrimp, Ronggeng Shrimp, and Prawns. The data used is 50 per class, so 350 images are used. Due to dataset limitations, the proposed contribution is an initial Resnet architecture with augmentation. Resnet helps perform in-depth training to save training computation time, and improvements add variety to limited amounts of data. The result is that the average accuracy of the model is 99.4%, with an average training computation time of 7 and a half minutes.

        "abstract": "PurposeSurface roughness has a serious impact on the fatigue strength, wear resistance and life of mechanical products. Realizing the evolution of surface quality through theoretical modeling takes a lot of effort. To predict the surface roughness of milling processing, this paper aims to construct a neural network based on deep learning and data augmentation.Design/methodology/approachThis study proposes a method consisting of three steps. Firstly, the machine tool multisource data acquisition platform is established, which combines sensor monitoring with machine tool communication to collect processing signals. Secondly, the feature parameters are extracted to reduce the interference and improve the model generalization ability. Thirdly, for different expectations, the parameters of the deep belief network (DBN) model are optimized by the tent-SSA algorithm to achieve more accurate roughness classification and regression prediction.FindingsThe adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) algorithm can improve the classification prediction accuracy of DBN from 80.67% to 94.23%. After the DBN parameters were optimized by Tent-SSA, the roughness prediction accuracy was significantly improved. For the classification model, the prediction accuracy is improved by 5.77% based on ADASYN optimization. For regression models, different objective functions can be set according to production requirements, such as root-mean-square error (RMSE) or MaxAE, and the error is reduced by more than 40% compared to the original model.Originality/valueA roughness prediction model based on multiple monitoring signals is proposed, which reduces the dependence on the acquisition of environmental variables and enhances the model's applicability. Furthermore, with the ADASYN algorithm, the Tent-SSA intelligent optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the hyperparameters of the DBN model and improve the optimization performance.",

        "abstract": "Forests are critical to mitigating global climate change and regulating climate through their role in the global carbon and water cycles. Accurate monitoring of forest cover is, therefore, essential. Image segmentation networks based on convolutional neural networks have shown significant advantages in remote sensing image analysis with the development of deep learning. However, deep learning networks typically require a large amount of manual ground truth labels for training, and existing widely used image segmentation networks struggle to extract details from large-scale high resolution satellite imagery. Improving the accuracy of forest image segmentation remains a challenge. To reduce the cost of manual labelling, this paper proposed a data augmentation method that expands the training data by modifying the spatial distribution of forest remote sensing images. In addition, to improve the ability of the network to extract multi-scale detailed features and the feature information from the NIR band of satellite images, we proposed a high-resolution forest remote sensing image segmentation network by fusing multi-scale features based on double input. The experimental results using the Sanjiangyuan plateau forest dataset show that our method achieves an IoU of 90.19%, which outperforms prevalent image segmentation networks. These results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can extract forests from remote sensing images more effectively and accurately.",

The application of ML and DL in classifying the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases holds significant potential for reducing diagnostic errors. This research endeavors to construct a model capable of accurately predicting cardiovascular diseases, thereby mitigating the fatality associated with CVD. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel approach that combines an artificial intelligence network (AIN)-based feature selection (FS) technique with cutting-edge DL and ML classifiers for the early detection of heart diseases based on patient medical histories. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using two real-world datasets sourced from the University of California.

        "abstract": "AbstractThe exponential growth of deep learning networks has enabled us to handle difficult tasks, even in the complex field of medicine. Nevertheless, for these models to be extremely generalizable and perform well, they need to be applied to a vast corpus of data. In order to train transfer learning networks with limited datasets, data augmentation techniques are frequently used due to the difficulties in getting data. The use of these methods is crucial in the medical industry in order to enhance the number of cancer-related magnetic resonance imaging pathology scans. This study evaluates the results of data augmentation methods on three deep transfer learning networks, such as InceptionV3, VGG16, and DenseNet169, for brain tumor identification. To demonstrate how data augmentation approaches affect the performance of the models, networks were trained both before and after the application of these methods. The outcomes revealed that the image augmentation strategies have a big impact on the networks before and after using techniques, such as the accuracy of VGG16 is 77.33% enhanced to 96.88%, and InceptionV3 changed from 86.66 to 98.44%, and DenseNet169 changed from 85.33 to 96.88% the accuracy percentage increase of the models are 19.55%, 11.78%, and 11.55%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Due to the unpredictable nature of the weather and the complexity of atmospheric movement, extreme weather has always been a significant and challenging meteorological concern. Meteorological problems and the complexity of how the atmosphere moves have made it necessary to find a technological solution. Deep learning techniques can automatically learn and train from vast quantities of data to provide enhanced feature expression. This is frequently used in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains to enhance the performance of numerous real-time problems. The purpose of this research is to propose a deep learning-based approach for effectively predicting extreme weather events such as blizzards. To recognize weather patterns and forecast blizzards, the proposed deep learning-based method primarily employs RNN with LSTM. Real-time datasets from the Polar Regions were used to test the proposed approach’s accuracy, and tests were conducted to compare it to existing weather forecasting models. The accuracy of the model is 49.60% (univariate) and 55.19% (bivariate) using bivariate attributes of wind speed and air pressure based on the calculated RMSE values such as 0.0023 and 0.0021.",

        "abstract": "Automated Cardiac Magnetic Resonance segmentation serves as a crucial tool for the evaluation of cardiac function, facilitating faster clinical assessments that prove advantageous for both practitioners and patients alike. Recent studies have predominantly concentrated on delineating structures on short-axis orientation, placing less emphasis on long-axis representations due to the intricate nature of structures in the latter. Taking these consideration into account, we present a robust hierarchy-based augmentation strategy coupled with the compact and fast Efficient-Net (ENet) architecture for the automated segmentation of two-chamber and four-chamber Cine-MRI images. We observed an average Dice improvement of 0.99% on the two-chamber images and of 2.15% on the four-chamber images, and an average Hausdorff distance improvement of 21.3% on the two-chamber images and of 29.6% on the four-chamber images. The practical viability of our approach was validated by computing clinical metrics such as the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular volume (LVC). We observed acceptable biases, with a +2.81% deviation on the LVEF for the two-chamber images and a +0.11% deviation for the four-chamber images.",

        "abstract": "X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is an inherited disorder characterized by retinal schisis cavities, which can be observed in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Monitoring disease progression necessitates the accurate segmentation and quantification of these cavities; yet, current manual methods are time consuming and result in subjective interpretations, highlighting the need for automated and precise solutions. We employed five state-of-the-art deep learning models—U-Net, U-Net++, Attention U-Net, Residual U-Net, and TransUNet—for the task, leveraging a dataset of 1500 OCT images from 30 patients. To enhance the models’ performance, we utilized data augmentation strategies that were optimized via deep reinforcement learning. The deep learning models achieved a human-equivalent accuracy level in the segmentation of schisis cavities, with U-Net++ surpassing others by attaining an accuracy of 0.9927 and a Dice coefficient of 0.8568. By utilizing reinforcement-learning-based automatic data augmentation, deep learning segmentation models demonstrate a robust and precise method for the automated segmentation of schisis cavities in OCT images. These findings are a promising step toward enhancing clinical evaluation and treatment planning for XLRS.",

        "abstract": "In UnderWater-Acoustic-Orthogonal-Frequency-Division-Multiplexing-(UWA-OFDM) communication, the traditional interpolated channel estimation method produces error codes, due to the small number of user pilots, uneven distribution, and complex channel characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel UWA-channel-estimation method based on Deep Learning (DL). First, based on a small number of channel samples, we used the CWGAN-GP model to generate enhanced classified underwater-acoustic channel samples to have semantic similarity to the real samples and also to present the diversity of the samples. After obtaining the channel sample, the pilot estimation matrix was processed in a similar image way. Here, we extracted the channel features by constructing a convolutional network structure similar to U-Net, weakening the impact of feature information loss. A Channel-Attention-Denoising-(CAD) module was also designed, to further optimize the reconstructed channel information. The simulation results verified the superiority of the proposed algorithm, in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit-Error Rate (BER) compared to the existing Least-Squares-(LS), Deep-Neural-Network-(DNN), and ChannelNet algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Mass production of high-quality synthetic SAR training imagery is essential for boosting the performance of deep-learning (DL)-based SAR automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms in an open-world environment. To address this problem, we exploit both the widely used Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) SAR dataset and the Synthetic and Measured Paired Labeled Experiment (SAMPLE) dataset, which consists of selected samples from the MSTAR dataset and their computer-generated synthetic counterparts. A series of data augmentation experiments are carried out. First, the sparsity of the scattering centers of the targets is exploited for new target pose synthesis. Additionally, training data with various clutter backgrounds are synthesized via clutter transfer, so that the neural networks are better prepared to cope with background changes in the test samples. To effectively augment the synthetic SAR imagery in the SAMPLE dataset, a novel contrast-based data augmentation technique is proposed. To improve the robustness of neural networks against out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, the SAR images of ground military vehicles collected by the self-developed MiniSAR system are used as the training data for the adversarial outlier exposure procedure. Simulation results show that the proposed data augmentation methods are effective in improving both the target classification accuracy and the OOD detection performance. The purpose of this work is to establish the foundation for large-scale, open-field implementation of DL-based SAR-ATR systems, which is not only of great value in the sense of theoretical research, but is also potentially meaningful in the aspect of military application.",
