        "abstract": "Data is the most valuable resource. We have a lot of unstructured data generated by the social media giants Twitter, Facebook, and Google. Unfortunately, analytics on unstructured data cannot be performed. As the availability of the internet became easier, people started using social media platforms as the primary medium for sharing their opinions. Every day, millions of opinions from different parts of the world are posted on Twitter. The primary goal of Twitter is to let people share their opinion with a big audience. So, if the authors can effectively analyse the tweets, valuable information can be gained. Storing these opinions in a structured manner and then using that to analyse people's reactions and perceptions about buying a product or a service is a very vital step for any corporate firm. Sentiment analysis aims to analyse and discover the sentiments behind opinions of various people on different subjects like commercial products, politics, and daily societal issues. This research has developed a model to determine the polarity of a keyword in real time. ",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate customer sentiments of restaurants in Artvin province. It was determined that 73.9% of the reviews were positive, and 26.1% were negative. 7 topics including place, view, price, food, service, staff and taste were extracted from the reviews. While the most reviews were about the place with 33.89%, it was followed by view with 15%, and the fewest reviews were about taste with 5.83%. It was found that the view topic was the most liked among these topics. 23.53% of those who commented on the price stated that the prices were high, while the percentage of those who indicated that the service was slow was 21.98%. In general, it was noticed that the service, place, food, and view topics were closely related to each other, and a customer who likes one of them is likely to appreciate the others and vice versa. It can be concluded that the application of RBSA and ML methods together is appropriate in terms of enabling both grammar rules and artificial intelligence methods and obtaining satisfactory results.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the co-creation process between citizens and local governments has become increasingly significant as a mechanism for addressing administrative concerns, such as public facility maintenance, disaster response, and overall administrative improvement driven by citizen feedback. Social media platforms have been recognized as effective tools to facilitate this co-creation process. Compared to traditional methods like surveys and public comment solicitations, social listening is deemed superior for obtaining authentic and naturally articulated citizen voices. However, there is a noticeable lack of research concerning the gathering of opinions specifically related to municipal issues via platforms like X (Twitter). This study seeks to address this gap by presenting an original methodology for analyzing citizen opinions through the deployment of large language models. Utilizing these models, we introduce three distinct applications based on our framework, each considering a different opinion typology. We demonstrate that our approach enables the analysis and comparison of citizen sentiments across various cities in relation to common political issues, tailoring the analysis to diverse goal types. The results of this research not only contribute to the understanding of citizen engagement via social media but also provide valuable insights into potential applications of large language models for municipal-related opinion analysis.",

        "abstract": "In the world of social networking, consumers tend to refer to expert comments or product reviews before making buying decisions. There is much useful information available on many social networking sites for consumers to make product comparisons. Sentiment analysis is considered appropriate for summarising the opinions. However, the sentences posted online are generally short, which sometimes contains both positive and negative word in the same post. Thus, it may not be sufficient to determine the sentiment polarity of a post by merely counting the number of sentiment words, summing up or averaging the associated scores of sentiment words. In this paper, an unsupervised learning technique, k-means, in conjunction with sentiment analysis, is proposed for assessing public opinions. The proposed approach offers the product designers a tool to promptly determine the critical design criteria for new product planning in the process of new product development by evaluating the user-generated content. The case implementation proves the applicability of the proposed approach. ",

This paper introduces term sentiment entropy (TSE), a novel weighting method that leverages the distribution of sentiment labels associated with words to enhance text classification accuracy. TSE complements traditional TF-IDF techniques by capturing the nuances of sentiment variation across different contexts. Experiments across diverse public datasets demonstrate TSE's potential to improve sentiment analysis performance, especially in capturing subtle sentiment shifts and adapting to specific domains. While computational cost and label quality pose challenges, TSE offers a promising avenue for refining sentiment analysis and opening new research frontiers.",

        "abstract": "The use of emerging digital information has become significant and exponential, as well as the boom of social media (forms, blogs, and social networks). Sentiment analysis concerns the statistical analysis of the views expressed in written texts. In appropriate evaluations of the emotional context, semantics plays an important role. The analysis is generally done from two viewpoints: how semantics are coded in sentimental instruments, such as lexicon, corporate, and ontological, and how automated systems determine feelings on social data. Two approaches to evaluate sentiments are commonly adopted (i.e., approaches focused on machine learning algorithms and semantic approaches). The precise testing in this area was increased by the already advanced semantic technology. This chapter focuses on semantic guidance-based sentiment analysis approaches. The Twitter/Facebook data will provide a semantically enhanced technique for annotation of sentiment polarity. ",

        "abstract": "In recent years, increasing attention is being paid to  sentiment analysis on microblogging platforms such as Twitter. Sentiment analysis refers to the task of detecting whether a textual item (e.g., a tweet) contains an opinion about a topic. This paper proposes a probabilistic deep learning approach for sentiments analysis. The deep learning model used is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The main contribution of this approach is a new probabilistic representation of the text to be fed as input to the  CNN. This representation is a matrix that   stores for each word composing the message the probability that it belongs to a positive class and  the probability that it belongs to a negative class.  The proposed approach is evaluated on four well-known datasets  HCR,  OMD, STS-gold, and a dataset provided by the SemEval-2017 Workshop. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach competes with the state-of-the-art sentiment analyzers and has the potential to detect sentiments from textual data in an effective manner.

        "abstract": "Purchase decisions are better when opinions/reviews about products are considered. Similarly, reviewing customer feedback help in improving the sale and ultimately benefit the business. Web 2.0 provides various platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. where one can comment, review, or post to express his/her happiness, anger, disbelief, sadness toward products, people, etc. To computationally analyze the sentiments in text requires a better understanding of the technologies used in sentiment analysis. This chapter gives a comprehensive understanding about the techniques used in sentiment analysis. Machine learning approaches are mostly used for sentiment analysis. Whereas, as per the text and required results, lexicon-based approaches are also used for the same purpose. This chapter includes the discussion on the evaluation parameters for the sentiment analysis. This chapter would also highlight ontology approach for sentiment analysis and outstanding contributions made in this field.

        "abstract": "With the accelerated evolution of social networks, there is a tremendous increase in opinions by the people about products or services. While this user-generated content in natural language is intended to be valuable, its large amounts require use of content mining methods and NLP to uncover the knowledge for various tasks. In this study, sentiment analysis is used to analyze and understand the opinions of users using statistical approaches, knowledge-based approaches, hybrid approaches, and concept-based ontologies. Unfortunately, sentiment analysis also experiences a range of difficulties like colloquial words, negation handling, ambiguity in word sense, coreference resolution, which highlight another perspective emphasizing that sentiment analysis is certainly a restricted NLP problem. The purpose of this chapter is to discover how sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem. Thus, this chapter discussed the concept of sentiment analysis in the field of NLP and explored that sentiment analysis is a restricted NLP problem due to the sophisticated nature of natural language.

Semantics plays a significant role in accurate analysis of an emotion speech context. Adding to this area, the already advanced semantic technologies have proven to increase the precision of the tests. Deep learning has emerged as a prominent machine learning technique that learns multiple layers or data characteristics and delivers state-of-the-art output. Throughout recent years, deep learning has been widely used in the study of sentiments, along with the growth of deep learning in many other fields of use. This chapter will offer a description of deep learning and its application in the analysis of sentiments. This chapter will focus on the semantic orientation-based approaches for sentiment analysis. In this work, a semantically enhanced methodology for the annotation of sentiment polarity in Twitter/ Facebook data will be presented. ",

There are hardly any studies in transportation analysis with TripAdvisor, and moreover, there is not a complete analysis from the point of view of sentiment analysis. The aim of study is to investigate and discover the presence of sustainable transport modes underlying in non-categorized TripAdvisor texts, such as walking mobility in order to impact positively in public services and businesses. The methodology follows a quantitative and qualitative approach based on knowledge discovery techniques. Thus, data gathering, normalization, classification, polarity analysis, and labelling tasks have been carried out to obtain sentiment labelled training data set in the transport domain as a valuable contribution for predictive analytics. This research has allowed the authors to discover sustainable transport modes underlying the texts, focused on walking mobility but extensible to other means of transport and social media sources. ",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is an important new field of research that has attracted the attention not only of researchers, but also businesses and organizations. In this article, the authors propose an effective model for aspect-based sentiment analysis for Vietnamese. First, sentiment dictionaries and syntactic dependency rules were combined to extract reliable word pairs (sentiment - aspect). They then relied on ontology to group these aspects and determine the sentiment polarity of each. They introduce two novel approaches in this work: 1) in order to “smooth” the sentiment scaling (rather than using discrete categories of 1, 0, and -1) for fined-grained classification, then extract multi-word sentiment phrases instead of sentiment words, and 2) the focus is not only on adjectives but also nouns and verbs. Initial evaluations of the system using real reviews show promising results. ",

        "abstract": "Social networks are the main resources to gather information about people's opinions and sentiments towards different topics as they spend hours daily on social media and share their opinions. Twitter is a platform widely used by people to express their opinions and display sentiments on different occasions. Sentiment analysis's (SA) task is to label people's opinions as different categories such as positive and negative from a given piece of text. Another task is to decide whether a given text is subjective, expressing the writer's opinions, or objective. These tasks were performed at different levels of analysis ranging from the document level to the sentence and phrase level. Another task is aspect extraction, which originated from aspect-based sentiment analysis in phrase level. All these tasks are under the umbrella of SA. In recent years, a large number of methods, techniques, and enhancements have been proposed for the problem of SA in different tasks at different levels. Sentiment analysis is an approach to analyze data and retrieve sentiment that it embodies. Twitter sentiment analysis is an application of sentiment analysis on data from Twitter (tweets) in order to extract sentiments conveyed by the user. In the past decades, the research in this field has consistently grown. The reason behind this is the challenging format of the tweets, which makes the processing difficult. The tweet format is very small, which generates a whole new dimension of problems like use of slang, abbreviations, etc. The chapter elaborately discusses three supervised machine learning algorithms—naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree—and compares their overall accuracy, precisions, as well as recall values; f-measure; number of tweets correctly classified; number of tweets incorrectly classified; and execution time.

When natural disasters occur, citizens' primary need is to reach as much information as possible about the status of loved ones possibly involved in the accident, road traffic, how to give an effective contribution to the cause without hindering, etc. On the other hand, P.A. and rescuers need to know as much information as possible about the reports, on the site of the disaster so as to intervene promptly to help the population in danger. Therefore, P.A. and citizens are called upon to cooperate to guarantee crisis containment, crisis management, and also future crisis prevention. ",

Nowadays, social networking and micro blogging websites are considered reliable sources of information since users may openly express their opinions in these forums. An investigation of the sentiment on social media could assist decision-makers in learning how consumers feel about their services, products, or policies. Extracting emotion from social media messages is a difficult task due to the difficulty of Natural Language Processing (NLP). These messages frequently use a combination of graphics, emoticons, text, etc. to convey the sentiment or opinion of the general people. These claims, known as eWOM (Electronic Word of Mouth), are quite common in public forums where people may express their opinions. A classification issue arises when categorizing the sentiment of eWOM as positive, negative, or neutral. We could not use standard NLP tools to examine social media sentiment. In this chapter, we will study the role of Artificial Intelligence in identifying the sentiment polarity of social media. We will apply ML(Machine Learning) methods to resolve this classification issue without diving into the difficulty of eWOM parsing.",

        "abstract": "In 2016, a number of language applications released chatbots to complement their programmes. Used primarily in informal learning settings, chatbots enable language learners to engage in conversational speaking practice, which can be perceived as less threatening than face-to-face interactions with native speakers. This study takes a closer look at four second language (L2) chatbots—Duolingo, Eggbun, Memrise, and Mondly—and analyses the experiences which informal language learners expressed on various online platforms (e.g., Duolingo forum, Memrise community, Reddit). Results indicate a degree of curiosity and a willingness to engage in conversation with chatbots. However, learners expressed frustration if the dialogues did not correspond to their learning goals or if they were excluded from using the bots because of technical or payment issues, or discontinuation of services.

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis can be a very useful aspect for the extraction of useful information from text documents. The main idea for sentiment analysis is how people think for a particular online review, i.e. product reviews, movie reviews, etc. Sentiment analysis is the process where these reviews are classified as positive or negative. The web is enriched with huge amount of reviews which can be analyzed to make it meaningful. This article presents the use of lexicon resources for sentiment analysis of different publicly available reviews. First, the polarity shift of reviews is handled by negations. Intensifiers, punctuation and acronyms are also taken into consideration during the processing phase. Second, words are extracted which have some opinion; these words are then used for computing score. Third, machine learning algorithms are applied and the experimental results show that the proposed model is effective in identifying the sentiments of reviews and opinions. ",

Incorporation of machine learning techniques with natural language processing helps in analysing and predicting the sentiments in more precise manner. But sometimes, machine learning techniques are incapable in predicting sentiments due to unavailability of labelled data. To overcome this problem, an advanced computational technique called deep learning comes into play.

Sentiment analysis can be exercised on movie reviews, blogs, customer feedback, etc. This chapter presents a novel approach to perform sentiment analysis of movie reviews given by users on different websites. Also, challenges like presence of thwarted words, world knowledge, and subjectivity detection in sentiments are addressed in this chapter. The results are validated by using two supervised machine learning approaches, k-nearest neighbor and naive Bayes, both on method of sentiment analysis without addressing aforementioned challenges and on proposed method of sentiment analysis with all challenges addressed. Empirical results show that proposed method outperformed the one that left challenges unaddressed. ",

This chapter is based on a discussion and comparison of various classification models that are used for phishing SMS detection through sentiment analysis. In this chapter, SMS data is collected from Kaggle, which is classified as ham or spam; while implementing the deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN with 7 layers, and CNN with 11 layers, different results are generated. For evaluating these results, different machine learning techniques are used as a baseline algorithm like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). After evaluation, CNN showed the highest accuracy of 99.47% as a classification model. ",

Furthermore, most research in this field deals with English texts, and very limited researches are undertaken on Arabic language.

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is used to detect the opinion/sentiment expressed from the unstructured text. Most of the existing state-of-the-art methods are based on supervised learning, and therefore, a labelled dataset is required to build the model, and it is very difficult task to obtain a labelled dataset for every domain. Cross-domain sentiment analysis is to develop a model which is trained on labelled dataset of one domain, and the performance is evaluated on another domain. The performance of such cross-domain sentiment analysis is still very limited due to presence of many domain-related terms, and the sentiment analysis is a domain-dependent problem in which words changes their polarity depending upon the domain. In addition, cross-domain sentiment analysis model suffers with the problem of large number of out-of-the-vocabulary (unseen words) words. In this paper, the authors propose a deep learning-based approach for cross-domain sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the performance on the benchmark dataset. ",

These social media data are available in an unstructured form, which includes images, text, and videos. The processing of these data is difficult, but some sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and recommender systems are used to process these unstructured data. To extract the opinion and sentiment of internet users from their written social media text, a sentiment analysis system is required to develop, which can work on both monolingual and bilingual phonetic text. Therefore, a sentiment analysis (SA) system is developed, which performs well on different domain datasets. The system performance is tested on four different datasets and achieved better accuracy of 3% on social media datasets, 1.5% on movie reviews, 1.35% on Amazon product reviews, and 4.56% on large Amazon product reviews than the state-of-art techniques. Also, the stemmer (StemVerb) for verbs of the English language is proposed, which improves the SA system's performance. ",

Accordingly, one area in which the application of new techniques in data mining research has significant potential to achieve more precise classification of hidden knowledge in Big Data is sentiment analysis (aka optimal mining). A hybrid approach using Naïve Bayes and Random Forest on mining Twitter datasets is presented here as an extension of previous work. Briefly, relevant data sets are collected from Twitter using Twitter API; then, use of the hybrid methodology is illustrated and evaluated against one with only Naïve Bayes classifier. Results show better accuracy and efficiency in the sentiment classification for the hybrid approach.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing pandemic situation of COVID-19 has impacted people across nations while taking social media by storm with its massive pool of information. As social media platforms are full of horserace reporting and uncritical or even fake updates most of the time, users should respond carefully during a crisis like COVID-19 pandemic while consuming and sharing updates. The current study presents an exploratory analysis of and highlights language use in terms of users' general awareness of the crisis and their responses on social media platforms through a sentiment analysis of 805 Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The findings reported users' varied sentiments while expressing their general awareness about the crisis and its widespread outbreak. It also reported their use of cognizant verbal expressions and abusive words as an expression for dealing with panic of the crisis. ",

        "abstract": "Due to the advent of Web 2.0, the size of social media content (SMC) is growing rapidly and likely to increase faster in the near future. Social media applications such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. have become an integral part of our lives, as they prompt the people to give their opinions and share information around the world. Identifying emotions in SMC is important for many aspects of sentiment analysis (SA) and is a top-level agenda of many firms today. SA on social media (SASM) extends an organization's ability to capture and study public sentiments toward social events and activities in real time. This chapter studies recent advances in machine learning (ML) used for SMC analysis and its applications. The framework of SASM consists of several phases, such as data collection, pre-processing, feature representation, model building, and evaluation. This survey presents the basic elements of SASM and its utility. Furthermore, the study reports that ML has a significant contribution to SMC mining. Finally, the research highlights certain issues related to ML used for SMC. ",

        "abstract": "Subjectivity is a key aspect of natural language understanding, especially in the context of user-generated text and conversational systems based on large language models. Natural language sentences often contain subjective elements, such as opinions and emotions, that make them more nuanced and complex. The level of detail at which the study of the text is performed determines the possible applications of sentiment analysis. The analysis can be done at the document or paragraph level, or, even more granularly, at the aspect level. Many researchers have studied this topic extensively. The field of aspect-based sentiment analysis has numerous data sets and models. In this work, we initiate the discussion around the definition of sentence difficulty in this context of aspect-based sentiment analysis. To assess and quantify the difficulty of the aspect-based sentiment analysis, we conduct an experiment using three data sets: “Laptops”, “Restaurants”, and “MTSC” (Multi-Target-dependent Sentiment Classification), along with 21 learning models from scikit-learn. We also use two textual representations, TF-IDF (Terms frequency-inverse document frequency) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to analyze the difficulty faced by these models in performing aspect-based sentiment analysis. Additionally, we compare the models with a fine-tuned version of BERT on the three data sets. We identify the most challenging sentences using a combination of classifiers in order to better understand them. We propose two strategies for defining sentence difficulty. The first strategy is binary and considers sentences as difficult when the classifiers are unable to correctly assign the sentiment polarity. The second strategy uses a six-level difficulty scale based on how many of the top five best-performing classifiers can correctly identify sentiment polarity. These sentences with assigned difficulty classes are then used to create predictive models for early difficulty detection. The purpose of estimating the difficulty of aspect-based sentiment analysis is to enhance performance while minimizing resource usage.",
