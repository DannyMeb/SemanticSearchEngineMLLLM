        "abstract": "Mixture models serve as one fundamental tool with versatile applications. However, their training techniques, like the popular Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, are notoriously sensitive to parameter initialization and often suffer from bad local optima that could be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. To address the long-lasting bad-local-optima challenge, we draw inspiration from the recent ground-breaking foundation models and propose to leverage their underlying big learning principle to upgrade the EM. Specifically, we present the Big Learning EM (BigLearn-EM), an EM upgrade that simultaneously performs joint, marginal, and orthogonally transformed marginal matchings between data and model distributions. Through simulated experiments, we empirically show that the BigLearn-EM is capable of delivering the optimal with high probability; comparisons on benchmark clustering datasets further demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages over existing techniques.

However, the presence of sarcasm makes it difficult for analyzing the sentiment of the statement. In the current scenario, the amount of sarcastic statements in any social media platform is high taking the forms of memes, comments, trolls etc. Hence it is important to identify sarcasm to preserve the polarity of any given statement. Sarcasm usually means the opposite of what the sentence seems to convey. While the existing works in literature have focused on detecting sarcasm, the proposed model, in addition to that, determines the levels of sarcasm present in the text, which will aid in finding the level of harshness present in the statement. In this work, an unsupervised learning model, Conditional Random Field model based Modified Expectation Maximization (CRF-MEM) algorithm has been proposed for detecting sarcasm in tweets. The proposed model aims to overcome the limitation present in the traditional EM algorithm, the random assignment factor, with the proposed aspect relationship value. Experimental results showed that the proposed CRF-MEM achieved an accuracy of 91.89% whereas the traditional EM displayed an accuracy of 80% in detecting sarcasm from text.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    ",

        "abstract": "The Long-Term Evaluation (LTE) based Fourth Generation (4G) and Fifth Generation (5G) communications require higher data rates to satisfy the requirements of user equipment. However, it is a difficult task for conventional Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems to deliver the highest throughput and data rates to end users. Additionally, an increase in data rates led to increased power consumption, which decreased spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper focuses on the implementation of the Doubly Selective with Expectation Maximization (DSEM) channel estimation method for Massive-MIMO based Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems. Here, the DSEM scheme divides the channel into expectation and maximization vectors based on antenna diversity. Further, time sample and frequency band base dual channel analysis are performed to maintain the synchronization in the receiver. The simulations conducted using MatlabR2018a show that base station (BS) capacity, user equipment capacity, uplink (UL)-Spectrum Efficiency (SE), and downlink (DL)-SE performance measures are improved in Massive-MIMO-NOMA systems using DSEM channel estimation and shows the superior performance than state of art approaches.",

One of these challenges is the harmonization of high-dimensional unbalanced and heterogeneous data. In this manuscript, we propose a statistical approach to combine incomplete and partially-overlapping pieces of covariance matrices that come from independent experiments. We assume that the data are a random sample of partial covariance matrices sampled from Wishart distributions and we derive an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. We demonstrate the properties of our method by (i) using simulation studies and (ii) using empirical datasets. In general, being able to make inferences about the covariance of variables not observed in the same experiment is a valuable tool for data analysis since covariance estimation is an important step in many statistical applications, such as multivariate analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.",

        "abstract": "\nPurpose:\nTo explore the influence of initial guess or estimate (uniform as ‚Äúones‚Äù and ‚Äúzeros‚Äù vs. filtered back projection [FBP] image) as an input image for maximum likelihood expectation‚Äìmaximization (MLEM) tomographic reconstruction algorithm and provide the curves of error or convergence for each of these three initial estimates.\n\n\nMethods:\nTwo phantoms, created as digital images, were utilized: one was a simple noiseless object and the other was a more complicated, noise-degraded object of the section of lower thorax in a matrix of 256 √ó 256 pixels. Both underwent radon transform or forward projection process and the corresponding sinograms were generated. For filtering during tomographic image reconstruction, ramp and Butterworth filters, as high-pass and low-pass ones, were applied to images. The second phantom (lower thorax) was radon-transformed and the resulting sinogram was degraded by noise. As initial guess or estimate images, in addition to FBP tomographic image, two uniform images, one with all pixels having a value of 1 (‚Äúones‚Äù) and the other with all having zero (‚Äúzeros‚Äù), were created. The three initial estimates (FBP, ones, and zeros) were reconstructed with iterative MLEM tomographic reconstruction (with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 iterations). The difference between the object and the updated slice was calculated at the end of each iteration (as error matrix), and the mean squared error (MSE) was computed and plotted separately or in conjunction with the MSE curves of other initial estimates. All computations were implemented in MATLAB software.\n\n\nResults:\nThe results of ones and zeros seemed strikingly similar. The curves of uniform ones and uniform zeros were so close to each other that overlap near-perfectly. However, in the FBP slice as an initial estimate, the resulting tomographic slice was similar with a much higher extent to the object even after 1 or 2 iterations. The pattern of convergence for all three curves was roughly similar. The normalized MSE decreased sharply up to 5 iterations and then, after 10 iterations, the curves reached a plateau until 32 iterations. For the phantom of the lower thorax section with its noise-degraded sinogram, similar to the pattern observed for simple disk-shaped phantom, the curves (normalized MSE) fell sharply up to 10 iterations and then rapidly converged thereafter until 64 iterations.\n\n\nConclusion:\nSimilar results are observed when choosing different initial guesses or estimates (uniform vs. FBP) as the starting point, based on the error calculation using MSE. The algorithm converges almost similarly for all initial estimates. Therefore, selecting a uniform initial guess image can be an appropriate choice and may be preferred over an FBP image. Reducing the processing time can be a valid reason for this choice.\n",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of how COVID-19 deaths observed in an oncology clinical trial can be consistently taken into account in typical survival estimates. We refer to oncological patients since there is empirical evidence of strong correlation between COVID-19 and cancer deaths, which implies that COVID-19 deaths cannot be treated simply as non-informative censoring, a property usually required by the classical survival estimators. We consider the problem in the framework of the widely used Kaplan‚ÄìMeier (KM) estimator. Through a counterfactual approach, an algorithmic method is developed allowing to include COVID-19 deaths in the observed data by mean-imputation. The procedure can be seen in the class of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms and will be referred to as Covid-Death Mean-Imputation (CoDMI) algorithm. We discuss the CoDMI underlying assumptions and the convergence issue. The algorithm provides a completed lifetime data set, where each Covid-death time is replaced by a point estimate of the corresponding virtual lifetime. This complete data set is naturally equipped with the corresponding KM survival function estimate and all available statistical tools can be applied to these data. However, mean-imputation requires an increased variance of the estimates. We then propose a natural extension of the classical Greenwood‚Äôs formula, thus obtaining expanded confidence intervals for the survival function estimate. To illustrate how the algorithm works, CoDMI is applied to real medical data extended by the addition of artificial Covid-death observations. The results are compared with the estimates provided by the two na√Øve approaches which count COVID-19 deaths as censoring or as deaths by the disease under study. In order to evaluate the predictive performances of CoDMI an extensive simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that in the simulated scenarios CoDMI is roughly unbiased and outperforms the estimates obtained by the na√Øve approaches. A user-friendly version of CoDMI programmed in R is freely available.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there are many types of digital materials that can be used in the classroom. Students and scholars are migrating from textbooks to digital study materials because textbooks are too large and expensive. Teachers and college students can use and modify the materials that are freely available or with some constraints for their learning and teaching. E-content can be designed, evolved, utilized, re-used, and distributed electronically from anywhere at anytime. Because of the flexibility of time, place, and speed of learning, e-content is becoming extremely popular. It can be readily and instantly shared and communicated with an infinite number of clients all across the globe. Document clustering is most commonly used to group documents that are related to a specific topic. Text document clustering can be used to group a collection of documents regarding the information they include and to deliver search results when a user searches the internet. In this paper mainly focuses on text document clustering to cope with massive collection of E-Content documents. Enhanced Expectation Maximization Text Document Clustering (EEMTDC) clustering algorithm was proposed and compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering, K-Means clustering, and Hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithms. The experiment shows that the performance of proposed EEMTDC algorithm produces greater clustering accuracy than existing clustering algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Due to the flexibility of the Weibull distribution and the proportional hazard (PH) model, Weibull PH is widely used in survival analysis under right censored data and interval censored data but it is seldom investigated under current status data, partially because there is less information in current status data than in right censored data and interval censored data. This paper considers the Weibull PH model under the current status data and introduces the Poisson latent variables to augment the data, then uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters. The EM algorithm is compared with the Newton‚ÄìRaphson (NR) algorithm from several perspectives in the simulation studies, and the results show that the proposed method has several highlights, such as computational simplicity, improved convergence stability, and overall estimator results that are either comparable or slightly better in terms of bias. Furthermore, the performance of the Weibull PH model and the semi-parametric PH model is compared under two simulation scenarios, and two standard model selection criteria are used for model selection. The results indicate that the Weibull PH model has significant advantages when failure time follows a Weibull distribution. Lastly, the Weibull PH model along with EM algorithm is applied to lung tumor data and intraocular lens (IOL) calcification data with the aim of assessing the impact of covariates, including environmental factors and gender, on event timing and risk.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of diseases in men and women can improve treatment and reduce the risk involved in human life. Nowadays techniques which are non-invasive in nature are popularly used to detect the various types of diseases. Histopathological analysis plays a major role in finding the nature of the disease through medical images. Manual interpretation of these medical imaging takes time, is tedious, subjective, and can have human errors. It has also been discovered that the interpretation of these images varies amongst diagnostic labs. As computer power and memory capacity have increased, methodologies and medical image processing techniques have been developed to interpret and analyse these images as a substitute for human involvement. The challenge lies in devising an efficient pre-processing technique that helps in analysing, processing and preparing the medical image for further diagnostics. This research provides a hybrid technique that reduces noise in the NITFI medical image by using a 2D adaptive median filter at level 1. The edges of the filtered medical image are preserved using the modified CLAHE algorithm which preserves the local contrast of the image. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm extracts the ROI part of the image which helps in easy and accurate identification of the disease. All the three steps are run over the 3D image slices of a NIFTI image. The proposed method proves that it achieves close to ideal RMSE, PSNR and UQI values as well as achieves an average runtime of 37.193 seconds for EM per slice.",

A significant number of psychological effects require (feelings) to be produced, directly releasing human emotions. The development of effect theory leads one to believe that one must be aware of one's sentiments and emotions to forecast one's behavior. The proposed line of inquiry focuses on developing a reliable model incorporating neurophysiological data into actual feelings. Any change in emotional affect will directly elicit a response in the body's physiological systems. This approach is named after the notion of Gaussian mixture models (GMM). The statistical reaction following data processing, quantitative findings on emotion labels, and coincidental responses with training samples all directly impact the outcomes that are accomplished. In terms of statistical parameters such as population mean and standard deviation, the suggested method is evaluated compared to a technique considered to be state-of-the-art. The proposed system determines an individual's emotional state after a minimum of 6 iterative learning using the Gaussian expectation-maximization (GEM) statistical model, in which the iterations tend to continue to zero error. Perhaps each of these improves predictions while simultaneously increasing the amount of value extracted.</p>",

For this purpose, a model was developed on the basis of expectation‚Äìmaximization machine learning (ML) and nanoindentation mapping. Using this model, it is possible to predict and interpret the microstructural features of solder joints through the micromechanical variations (i.e. elastic modulus) of interconnection. According to the results, the classification of Sn-based matrix, intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and the grain boundaries with specified elastic-modulus ranges was successfully performed through the ML model. However, it was detected some overestimations in regression process when the interfacial regions got thickened in the microstructure. The ML outcomes also revealed that the thermal-cycling evolution was accompanied with stiffening and growth of IMCs; while the spatial portion of Sn-based matrix decreased in the microstructure. It was also figured out that the stiffness gradient becomes intensified in the treated samples, which is consistent with this fact that the thermal cycling increases the mechanical mismatch between the matrix and the IMCs.",

Moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) allows for simultaneous testing of DIF among multiple categorical and continuous covariates (e.g., sex, age, ethnicity, etc.), and regularization has shown promising results for identifying DIF among many covariates. However, computationally inefficient estimation methods have hampered practical use of the regularized MNFLA method. We develop a penalized expectation‚Äìmaximization (EM) algorithm with soft- and firm-thresholding to more efficiently estimate regularized MNLFA parameters. Simulation and empirical results show that, compared to previous implementations of regularized MNFLA, the penalized EM algorithm is faster, more flexible, and more statistically principled. This method also yields similar recovery of DIF relative to previous implementations, suggesting that regularized DIF detection remains a preferred approach over traditional methods of identifying DIF.

        "abstract": "In regression modelling, measurement error models are often needed to correct for uncertainty arising from measurements of covariates/predictor variables. The literature on measurement error (or errors-in-variables) modelling is plentiful, however, general algorithms and software for maximum likelihood estimation of models with measurement error are not as readily available, in a form that they can be used by applied researchers without relatively advanced statistical expertise. In this study, we develop a novel algorithm for measurement error modelling, which could in principle take any regression model fitted by maximum likelihood, or penalised likelihood, and extend it to account for uncertainty in covariates. This is achieved by exploiting an interesting property of the Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, namely that it can be expressed as an iteratively reweighted maximisation of complete data likelihoods (formed by imputing the missing values). Thus we can take any regression model for which we have an algorithm for (penalised) likelihood estimation when covariates are error-free, nest it within our proposed iteratively reweighted MCEM algorithm, and thus account for uncertainty in covariates. The approach is demonstrated on examples involving generalized linear models, point process models, generalized additive models and capture‚Äìrecapture models. Because the proposed method uses maximum (penalised) likelihood, it inherits advantageous optimality and inferential properties, as illustrated by simulation. We also study the model robustness of some violations in predictor distributional assumptions. Software is provided as the refitME package on R, whose key function behaves like a refit() function, taking a fitted regression model object and re-fitting with a pre-specified amount of measurement error.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) active target localization is generally hindered by the high temporal and spatial sidelobe levels in snapshot-deficient scenarios, where the adaptive approaches undergo performance degeneration since they require many snapshots to build the sample covariance matrix. Aiming at working robustly in snapshot-deficient active scenarios, a 2D expectation-maximization-based vertical-time-record (EMVTR) approach is proposed to compensate for the snapshot deficiency and achieve the high-resolution active localization by reconstructing the covariance matrix using estimated hyperparameters, i.e., signal powers and noise variance. With the short-time Fourier transform, the proposed approach could reduce echoes' temporal correlation and attain robust beam-time localization in mild reverberation. The multi-frequency EMVTR is derived from the single-frequency case to improve the weak echo localization. The performance is evaluated by considering single and multiple target echoes in simulation and a single moving target with tank experimental data. The results manifest the proposed EMVTR's robustness and effectiveness for the 2D active localization in snapshot-deficient scenarios.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationAdvances in RNA sequencing technologies have achieved an unprecedented accuracy in the quantification of mRNA isoforms, but our knowledge of isoform-specific functions has lagged behind. There is a need to understand the functional consequences of differential splicing, which could be supported by the generation of accurate and comprehensive isoform-specific gene ontology annotations.ResultsWe present isoform interpretation, a method that uses expectation‚Äìmaximization to infer isoform-specific functions based on the relationship between sequence and functional isoform similarity. We predicted isoform-specific functional annotations for 85¬†617 isoforms of 17¬†900 protein-coding human genes spanning a range of 17¬†430 distinct gene ontology terms. Comparison with a gold-standard corpus of manually annotated human isoform functions showed that isoform interpretation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. We provide experimental evidence that functionally related isoforms predicted by isoform interpretation show a higher degree of domain sharing and expression correlation than functionally related genes. We also show that isoform sequence similarity correlates better with inferred isoform function than with gene-level function.Availability and implementationSource code, documentation, and resource files are freely available under a GNU3 license at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/isopretEM and https://zenodo.org/record/7594321.",

        "abstract": "The underwater motion of the ROV is affected by various environmental factors, such as wind, waves, and currents. The complex relationship between these disturbance variables results in non-Gaussian noise distribution, which cannot be handled by the classical Kalman filter. For the accurate and real-time observation of ROV climbing, and, at the same time, to reduce the influence of the uncertainty of the noise distribution, the ROV state filter is designed based on the mixture of Gaussian model theory with the expectation-maximization cubature particle filter (EM-MOGCPF). The EM-MOGCPF considers different sensor measurement noises, and the addition of mixture of Gaussian (MOG) improves the fineness and real-time properties, while the expectation-maximization (EM) reduces the complexity of the algorithm. To estimate the ROV xyz-axis and yaw angular states, we establish a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) ROV kinetics model, which uses a simulation platform for multiple sea state degrees. The results show that the EM-MOGCPF effectively improves the estimation accuracy and exhibits strong adaptability to nonlinear and non-Gaussian environments. We believe that this algorithm holds promise in solving the state estimation challenge in these difficult environments.",

Unfortunately, this is a very complex task because several issues often arise in the collected data, due to the sensitivity of the topic. In sample surveys, one major problem is misclassification. Without appropriate adjustments, inference would provide biased estimates, the reason being the concealing of undeclared status. In order to overcome such problem, we developed a methodology based on a Expectation‚ÄìMaximization algorithm that accounts for misclassification due to dishonest answering. Through the proposed approach, we are able to estimate the prevalence of UW and its determinants. The reliability of the methodology is validated through an extensive simulation study.

        "abstract": "Channel equalization plays a crucial role in single-carrier underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. Recently, a frequency-domain turbo equalization (FDTE) scheme enabled by the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm, was proposed, and it outperformed classic linear minimum mean square error FDTE at acceptable complexity cost. The operation of the VAMP-FDTE requires knowledge of noise power, which is predetermined before the equalization starts. In practice, however, it is difficult to obtain prior knowledge of noise power due to factors of unknown channel estimation errors and dynamic underwater environments. Motivated by this fact, we propose an enhanced VAMP-FDTE scheme, which learns the noise power knowledge during the equalization process via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM-based noise power estimation makes use of intermediate results of the VAMP-FDTE and, thus, only incurs a small extra computational overhead. The improved VAMP-FDTE, named EM-VAMP-FDTE, was tested by experimental data collected in shallow-sea horizontal UWA communication trials with MIMO configuration. It showed better performance than the existing VAMP-FDTE scheme, attributed to the online noise power learning.",

To treat non-stationary probabilistic regression, the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model has been proposed, but it may not perform well in some cases due to the limited ability of each Gaussian process (GP) expert. Although the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) and warped Gaussian process (WGP) models are dominant and effective for non-stationary probabilistic regression, they may not be able to handle general non-stationary probabilistic regression in practice. In this paper, we first propose the mixture of warped Gaussian processes (MWGP) model as well as its classification expectation‚Äìmaximization (CEM) algorithm to address this problem. To overcome the local optimum of the CEM algorithm, we then propose the split and merge CEM (SMC EM) algorithm for MWGP.

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nObjective. In our previous work on image reconstruction for single-layer collimatorless scintigraphy, we developed the min‚Äìmin weighted robust least squares (WRLS) optimization algorithm to address the challenge of reconstructing images when both the system matrix and the projection data are uncertain. Whereas the WRLS algorithm has been successful in two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction, expanding it to three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is difficult since the WRLS optimization problem is neither smooth nor strongly-convex. To overcome these difficulties and achieve robust image reconstruction in the presence of system uncertainties and projection noise, we propose a generalized iterative method based on the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm, hereinafter referred to as the Masked-MLEM algorithm. Approach. In the Masked-MLEM algorithm, only selected subsets (‚Äòmasks‚Äô) from the system matrix and the projection contribute to the image update to satisfy the constraints imposed by the system uncertainties. We validate the Masked-MLEM algorithm and compare it to the standard MLEM algorithm using experimental data obtained from both collimated and uncollimated imaging instruments, including parallel-hole collimated SPECT, 2D collimatorless scintigraphy, and 3D collimatorless tomography. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations for 3D collimatorless tomography to further validate the effectiveness of the Masked-MLEM algorithm in handling different levels of system uncertainties. Main results. The Masked-MLEM and standard MLEM reconstructions are similar in cases with negligible system uncertainties, whereas the Masked-MLEM algorithm outperforms the standard MLEM algorithm when the system matrix is an approximation. Importantly, the Masked-MLEM algorithm ensures reliable image reconstruction across varying levels of system uncertainties. Significance. With a good choice of system uncertainty and without requiring accurate knowledge of the actual system matrix, the Masked-MLEM algorithm yields more robust image reconstruction than the standard MLEM algorithm, effectively reducing the likelihood of erroneously reconstructing higher activities in regions without radioactive sources.",

        "abstract": "The study of process mineralogy plays a very important role in the field of mineral processing and metallurgy, in which the measurement of mineral-embedded particle size is one of the main research areas. The manual measurement method using a microscope has many problems, such as heavy workload and low measurement accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Gaussian mixture model based on an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to measure the embedded particle sizes of minerals of polished metal sections. Experiments are here performed on the polished section images of ilmenite and pyrite, and we compared the results with a microscope. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher precision and accuracy in measuring the embedded particle sizes of metal minerals.",

        "abstract": " High-resolution and high-fidelity seismic inversion imaging is one of the core issues of lithologic reservoir exploration. As a linearization subproblem of full-waveform inversion, least-squares migration (LSM) can obtain inversion results with more reliable amplitude, better resolution, and fewer artifacts that can be solved in either the data domain or image domain. For data-domain LSM, the calculation of the data-domain iteration can be very computationally intensive. In practical situations, the convexity of the cost function of LSM could be poor, resulting in slow or even nonconvergence iteration, so the ideal inversion imaging results cannot be reached. The image-domain LSM (ID-LSM) follows the logic of image deblurring, which realizes the effects of LSM in another way. The key problem of ID-LSM is to calculate a reliable Hessian matrix that can be effectively replaced by a set of point-spread functions (PSFs). Affected by the unknown source wavelet, the accuracy of the background velocity, and the accuracy of the forward/migration operator, the calculation results of the Hessian/PSF cannot be accurate. We first illustrate the impact of incorrect Hessian/PSF on ID-LSM through numerical experiments. To eliminate the influence of the inaccuracy of PSF, we develop the ID-LSM problem as a high-dimensional image deconvolution problem. An alternate update strategy of PSF and imaging results is given under the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm by additionally introducing prior information about PSF and the inversion result. Numerical examples of synthetic data and field data verify that our method significantly improves image quality. ",

Under the basis of the observable canonical form of the bilinear model, the system output can be written as a regressive form, and a bilinear state observer is applied to estimate the unknown states. To eliminate the influence of outliers and time‚Äêvarying delays on parameter estimation, we employ the Student's  distribution to deal with the measurement noise and use a first‚Äêorder Markov chain to model the delays. In the framework of expectation‚Äêmaximization (EM) algorithm, the unknown parameters, delays, noise variance, states and transition probability matrix can be estimated iteratively. A numerical simulation and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good immunity against outliers and time‚Äêvarying delays and offers good estimation accuracy for the bilinear SSM.",

        "abstract": "The secure operation of smart grids is closely linked to state estimates that accurately reflect the physical characteristics of the grid. However, well-designed false data injection attacks (FDIAs) can manipulate the process of state estimation by injecting malicious data into the measurement data while bypassing the detection of the security system, ultimately causing the results of state estimation to deviate from secure values. Since FDIAs tampering with the measurement data of some buses will lead to error offset, this paper proposes an attack-detection algorithm based on statistical learning according to the different characteristic parameters of measurement error before and after tampering. In order to detect and classify false data from the measurement data, in this paper, we report the model establishment and estimation of error parameters for the tampered measurement data by combining the the k-means++ algorithm with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. At the same time, we located and recorded the bus that the attacker attempted to tamper with. In order to verify the feasibility of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the IEEE 5-bus standard test system and the IEEE 14-bus standard test system were used for simulation analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that the combined use of the two algorithms can decrease the detection time to less than 0.011883 s and correctly locate the false data with a probability of more than 95%.",

Accurate and efficient detection of SNVs from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for various applications in genomics and personalized medicine. However, SNV calling methods usually suffer from high computational complexity and limited accuracy. In this context, there is a need for new methods that overcome these limitations and provide fast reliable results.\n\n\nResults\nWe present EMVC-2, a novel method for SNV calling from NGS data. EMVC-2 uses a multi-class ensemble classification approach based on the expectation‚Äìmaximization algorithm that infers at each locus the most likely genotype from multiple labels provided by different learners. The inferred variants are then validated by a decision tree that filters out unlikely ones. We evaluate EMVC-2 on several publicly available real human NGS data for which the set of SNVs is available, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art variant callers in terms of accuracy and speed, on average.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nEMVC-2 is coded in C and Python, and is freely available for download at: https://github.com/guilledufort/EMVC-2. EMVC-2 is also available in Bioconda.\n",

In this diagnostic, neutrons passing through a rolled edge aperture form an image on a CR-39-based solid state nuclear track detector.

        "abstract": "Expectation violations occur when there is a discrepancy between expected and perceived events or experiences. Often, however, expectations persist despite disconfirming evidence. Therefore, research on expectation violations, expectation change, and expectation persistence has been conducted in several fields of psychology with wide-ranging theoretical assumptions and empirical considerations. In the present review, we analysed how these research fields relate to each other using bibliometric network analyses. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature search to identify scientific publications on expectation violations, expectation change, and expectation persistence. The literature corpus was then quantitatively analysed using similarity measures that allow a data-driven classification of publications into groups, revealing their conceptual, theoretical, and empirical commonalities. Our results indicate that many influential publications have focused on finding reactivity measures (e.g., brain activation) to the discrepancy experienced between expectations and outcomes. Furthermore, these measures have been used to assess when and to which degree learning and behavioural adaptation (i.e., expectation change) take place. We discuss the potential application of these measures for understanding expectation violations, expectation change, and expectation persistence in more complex settings (e.g., social interaction). The goal of this review was to foster interdisciplinarity in psychology, enabling scientists and practitioners to identify new topics, promising empirical approaches, and previously neglected variables.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the infrared and visible image fusion is to generate a fused image with rich information. Although most fusion methods can achieve good performance, there are still shortcomings in extracting feature information from source images, which make it difficult to balance the thermal radiation region information and texture detail information in the fused image. To address the above issues, an expectation maximization (EM) learning framework based on adversarial generative networks (GAN) for infrared and visible image fusion is proposed. The EM algorithm (EMA) can obtain maximum likelihood estimation for problems with potential variables, which is helpful in solving the problem of lack of labels in infrared and visible image fusion. The axial‚Äêcorner attention mechanism is designed to capture long‚Äêrange semantic information and texture information of the visible image. The multifrequency attention mechanism digs the relationships between features at different scales to highlight target information of infrared images in the fused result. Meanwhile, two discriminators are used to balance two different features, and a new loss function is designed to maximize the likelihood estimate of the data with soft class label assignments, which is obtained from the expectation network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EMA‚ÄêGAN over the state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart.",

        "abstract": "One of the main concerns in multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) is to detect the relationship between observed items and latent traits, which is typically addressed by the exploratory analysis and factor rotation techniques. Recently, an EM-based L1-penalized log-likelihood method (EML1) is proposed as a vital alternative to factor rotation. Based on the observed test response data, EML1 can yield a sparse and interpretable estimate of the loading matrix. However, EML1 suffers from high computational burden. In this paper, we consider the coordinate descent algorithm to optimize a new weighted log-likelihood, and consequently propose an improved EML1 (IEML1) which is more than 30 times faster than EML1. The performance of IEML1 is evaluated through simulation studies and an application on a real data set related to the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire is used to demonstrate our methodologies.",

This essay explores how built environments can be designed to evoke positive anticipation of future events. It suggests that there are three primary means of achieving this: (1) the visible display of valued resources, (2) signs of readiness, and (3) views that encourage mental exploration. It is observed that while resources tend to elicit hope of their future use, readiness and visual prospects seem to evoke a more general sense of optimism. Given the large proportion of our lives that most of us now spend in buildings, it is suggested that these design strategies might be helpful in maintaining and improving occupant morale in the indoor spaces where we live and work, and even more so for those who, for one reason or another, are unable to venture out.",

        "abstract": "Life expectancy is an indicator in measuring government performance in improving the level of health and well-being of the population of a region. While life expectancy on Sumatra Island has variable values, the quality of public health is less uniform. These variations can be caused by several factors such as education, health services, and economic conditions. Therefore, the government needs to provide further treatment on Sumatra Island by identifying factors that affect life expectancy. The study used a Spatial Durbin Model with Queen Contiguity and Rook Contiguity 154 districts/cities on the island of Sumatra. The variables used in the study were data on life expectancy, average school age, the percentage of many infants who received complete immunization, the percent of households having access to decent drinking water, the proportion of the poor population, the regional gross domestic product in 2021. The results of the study showed that the best model was the model that used the Queen Contiguity weighing matrix because it had a smaller AIC value of 365.22. Factors influencing the life expectancy of the population of Sumatra Island in 2021 using the durbin spatial model with the Queen weigher are the average age of school, the percentage of the poor population, and the regional gross domestic product.",

        "abstract": "Rational household asset allocation is crucial for the accumulation of household wealth. However, there is still a widespread phenomenon of limited participation among households. This paper aims to explore the impact of the investment expectation gap on households‚Äô risky financial asset investment. Utilizing data from the China Household Finance Survey 2019, this paper systematically investigates the role of the investment expectation gap in risky financial asset investment through the Probit and Tobit models. The study reveals that the investment expectation gap has a significant negative impact on the investment probability (Average Marginal Effect, ‚Äì0.118, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and holding proportion (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.082, p &amp;lt; 0.01) of household investment in risky financial assets. This conclusion remains robust after conducting robustness tests by replacing the explanatory variable and performing subsample tests and endogenous treatment. The analysis of transmission mechanisms revealed that an expanding of the investment expectation gap would concurrently result in a decline in households‚Äô assessment of stock‚Äôs profitability (Average Marginal Effect, ‚Äì0.080, p &amp;lt; 0.01), the satisfaction with current asset allocation (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.167, p &amp;lt; 0.05), and the subjective well-being of household members (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.289, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the investment expectation gap not only hampers household investment in risky financial asset, but also diminish the household savings rate (Œ≤, ‚Äì0.055, p &amp;lt; 0.01). This study demonstrates that helping households form reasonable expectations for risky financial assets investment returns will contribute to diversifying household asset allocation and enhancing satisfaction with investment decisions.\nAcknowledgmentThis study is funded by the Chongqing Social Science Planning Fund, grant number (2021BS052).",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn the Determinant Maximization problem, given an $$n \\times n$$\n\nn\n√ó\nn\n\n positive semi-definite matrix $${\\textbf {A}} $$\nA\n in $$\\mathbb {Q}^{n \\times n}$$\n\n\nQ\n\n\nn\n√ó\nn\n\n\n and an integer k, we are required to find a $$k \\times k$$\n\nk\n√ó\nk\n\n principal submatrix of $${\\textbf {A}} $$\nA\n having the maximum determinant. This problem is known to be -hard and further proven to be [1]-hard with respect to k by Koutis (Inf Process Lett 100:8‚Äì13, 2006); i.e., a $$f(k)n^{{{\\,\\mathrm{\\mathcal {O}}\\,}}(1)}$$\n\nf\n\n(\nk\n)\n\n\nn\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n-time algorithm is unlikely to exist for any computable function¬†f. However, there is still room to explore its parameterized complexity in the restricted case, in the hope of overcoming the general-case parameterized intractability. In this study, we rule out the fixed-parameter tractability of Determinant Maximization even if an input matrix is extremely sparse or low rank, or an approximate solution is acceptable. We first prove that Determinant Maximization is -hard and [1]-hard even if an input matrix is an arrowhead matrix; i.e., the underlying graph formed by nonzero entries is a star, implying that the structural sparsity is not helpful. By contrast, Determinant Maximization is known to be solvable in polynomial time on tridiagonal matrices (Al-Thani and Lee, in: LAGOS, 2021). Thereafter, we demonstrate the [1]-hardness with respect to the rankr of an input matrix. Our result is stronger than Koutis‚Äô result in the sense that any $$k \\times k$$\n\nk\n√ó\nk\n\n principal submatrix is singular whenever $$k > r$$\n\nk\n>\nr\n\n. We finally give evidence that it is [1]-hard to approximate Determinant Maximization parameterized by k within a factor of $$2^{-c\\sqrt{k}}$$\n\n2\n\n-\nc\n\nk\n\n\n\n for some universal constant $$c > 0$$\n\nc\n>\n0\n\n. Our hardness result is conditional on the Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis posed by Lokshtanov et al. (in: SODA, 2020), which asserts that a gap version of Binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem is [1]-hard. To complement this result, we develop an $$\\varepsilon $$\nŒµ\n-additive approximation algorithm that runs in $$\\varepsilon ^{-r^2} \\cdot r^{{{\\,\\mathrm{\\mathcal {O}}\\,}}(r^3)} \\cdot n^{{{\\,\\mathrm{\\mathcal {O}}\\,}}(1)}$$\n\n\nŒµ\n\n-\n\nr\n2\n\n\n\n¬∑\n\nr\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n(\n\nr\n3\n\n)\n\n\n¬∑\n\nn\n\n\n\nO\n\n\n(\n1\n)\n\n\n\n time for the rank r of an input matrix, provided that the diagonal entries are bounded.",

This paper introduces the technology of Blockchain, including the basic concept of Blockchain and how Blockchain works to allow decentralization of trades; The system of Ethereum and the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), how it was invented, what was the central mission of its invention, as well as how it differs from Bitcoin and how can it allow more decentralized application to be developed, which in turn illustrates what it means and where its values lie. As all cryptocurrency markets have a huge fall in value in the year 2022, as shown in figure 1, many people are losing faith in cryptocurrency. Many believe that since it is entirely digital and non-government based, it has no actual value, that the entire cryptocurrency market is a bubble. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies introduce a very revolutionary concept, which is the decentralization of applications, and this decentralization can apply to many things, leading to a great technological structure modification, even for social structures. Because of its anonymous and democratic nature, there is also always going to be demand for cryptocurrencies. Thus, this paper also analyzes the expectations of cryptocurrency, mainly Ether, and the predictions of its future development.",

We assess whether professionals form their expectations regarding inflation and unemployment consistent with the Phillips curve based on individual forecast data taken from the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters. We consider expectations over different horizons and do not restrict the analysis to point forecasts but we also take the information inherent in density forecasts into account. We explicitly consider the role of anchoring of inflation expectations as potential source of nonlinearity, and we also assess whether the Phillips curve relation translates to a link between uncertainty regarding inflation and unemployment. Our findings show that professionals tend to build their expectations in line with the Phillips curve but this is only observed for expectations made for shorter horizons. For longer horizons, the Phillips curve connection is much weaker. This relationship also depends on the degree of anchoring and results in a connection between uncertainty regarding future inflation and unemployment.",

        "abstract": "\n                        <>Recently, fuzzy utility pattern mining has received much attention for its practicality and comprehensibility. It aims to discover high fuzzy utility itemsets (HFUIs) by considering not only utility but also linguistic factors. Among existing algorithms, experiments showed that fuzzy-list-based algorithms are effective and efficient. However, a significant disadvantage of fuzzy-list-based algorithms is that constructing and maintaining fuzzy-lists is time-consuming and memory-overhead. To address this issue, a novel algorithm named explainable Itemset Utility Maximization with Fuzzy Set (FS-IUM) is proposed in this paper. The traditional fuzzy-list structure is replaced by a better structure (i.e., fuzzy-list buffer), which speeds up the mining process and reduces memory consumption. Compared with fuzzy-list structure, the fuzzy-list buffer structure and its auxiliary structure help the algorithm locate the fuzzy-list quickly and thus reduce the runtime. Moreover, with an efficient fuzzy-list buffer construction method, the algorithm reduces the cost of candidate storage. Furthermore, with several efficient strategies, the proposed algorithm can prune numerous useless patterns in advance and thus considerably reduces the runtime usage. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets were conducted to compare the performance of FS-IUM with some state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results reveal that the proposed fuzzy-list buffer-based algorithm highly outperforms the baselines in terms of runtime and memory consumption.<>\n                    ",

        "abstract": "Possibility and probability are the two aspects of uncertainty, where uncertainty represents the ignorance of a given individual. The notion of alternative (or event) belongs to the domain of possibility. An event is intrinsically subdivisible and a quadratic metric, whose value is intrinsic or invariant, is used to study it. By subdividing the notion of alternative, a joint (bivariate) distribution of mass appears. The mathematical expectation of X is proved to be invariant using joint distributions of mass. The same is true for X12 and X12‚Ä¶m. This paper describes the notion of Œ±-product, which refers to joint distributions of mass, as a way to connect the concept of probability with multilinear matters that can be treated through statistical inference. This multilinear approach is a meaningful innovation with regard to the current literature. Linear spaces over R with a different dimension can be used as elements of probability spaces. In this study, a more general expression for a measure of variability referred to a single random quantity is obtained. This multilinear measure is obtained using different joint distributions of mass, which are all considered together.",

        "abstract": "This essay explores a set of poetic texts‚Äîthe Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT); Amy Sara Carroll's ‚ÄúThe Desert Survival Series/La serie de sobrevivencia del desierto‚Äù; and Claudia Rankine and John Lucas's video poem ‚ÄúZidane‚Äù and the version of that poem included in Rankine's book Citizen‚Äîagainst the backdrop of recent United States Customs and Border Protection investment in autonomous surveillance towers, the development of the ‚Äú100 mile‚Äù expanded border region, and 2022 practices by Republican governors to relocate migrants to the U.S. to Democrat states. I argue for the existence in the poetry of what I term ‚Äúthe expectation of the border‚Äù: the moment when we name the border not as a graspable and unchangeable line in physical space and legal jurisdiction, but as a conceptual reckoning with definitions of community, including but not limited to citizenship status. Drawing on citizenship theorist Engin Isin's argument that ‚Äúpoetic articulation‚Äù especially ‚Äúcaptures the essence of the political,‚Äù this study suggests poetry as a specialized intervention in border politics and definitions of citizenship, including the conditions of the ‚Äúhostile environment‚Äù.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to review recent empirical literature on the components and reducing factors of the Audit Expectation Gap distinguishing research conducted in developed countries relative to developing countries. We adopt a systematic literature review to review papers published between 2010 and 2020. To do so, we conducted a methodological process that combines an electronic search and a manual analysis to extract and analyze data. The results of our literature review show that fewer studies have been conducted in developed countries than in developing countries, because the AEG is no longer a contemporary theme in developed countries. Researchers from developed countries have revealed the existence of AEG, firstly, in the areas of auditor responsibilities, and especially in fraud detection and prevention. In order to mitigate AEG, audit education is seen as the primary factor in reducing AEG. Extending our study to developing countries, a clearer picture of AEG is found predominantly in auditors‚Äô responsibilities in prevention and detection of fraud and other illegal acts and unreasonable expectations of public and auditor‚Äôs features. In order to reduce AEG, three factors are widely cited in the literature in developing countries: Audit education; Enhancement of auditor performance and Increasing the information content of audit reports.",

        "abstract": "This article discusses Nepali people‚Äôs experience with socialism and their expectations by addressing these questions: What is socialism? Which socialism do Nepali people expect? Why do they expect socialism? How does the principle go against the practice in the context of Nepal? Qualitative secondary sources are critically analyzed as methodological tools to reveal the present experience and expectations of Nepali people. It presents the disparity between principle and practice demonstrated by the Nepali political parties. The Constitution of Nepal2015 has formally promised that the guiding political-economic principle of this state is socialism-oriented. However, the sayings and doings of major political parties in Nepal have a big gap. In their doings, they are highly influenced by liberal capitalist principles, and they continue implementing neo-liberal policies. They put forward liberal bourgeois policies and programs that suited the interest of the comprador bourgeoisie. Thus, we have seen a contradiction in their implementation of the socialist principle, which goes against the expectation of the Nepali people. By pointing out this gap, this article highlights the need for serious discussions on achieving socialism as stated in Nepal‚Äôs constitution and expected by the people while also drawing the attention of the political actors to take immediate and radical actions to correct their behaviors in time in order to achieve the goal of a Socialism Nepal.",

In treatment Baseline, subjects only observe past values of A. In treatment Correlated, they additionally observe a correlated variable B; A is equally predictable and has the same univariate properties in both treatments. Subjects are significantly less accurate and underreact more in Correlated, inconsistent with Bayesian learning. A structural-model estimation indicates that subjects (i) underestimate the level of correlation and (ii) are insensitive to actual correlation. Our study provides first direct evidence of correlation neglect in the domain of expectation formation.",

        "abstract": "PurposeEnterprise information systems (EISs) are intricate technological artifacts with wide user base within organizations. While much is known about the adoption and implementation of EISs, little is known about what subsequently follows them, i.e. the assimilation of EISs. This article aims to examine the assimilation of the EISs which is consequential to realizing any benefits from such enterprise technology.Design/methodology/approachThe author conceptually draws on the insights from the expectation confirmation theory, theory of reasoned action, equity theory, and prospect theory to examine the¬†assimilation of the EISs. In doing so, the author generates competing testable hypotheses regarding the relationship between individual users' psychological and social influences through expectation (dis)confirmation and the users' intention to assimilate the EISs.FindingsBy conceptually articulating the individual users' psychological and social influences through expectation (dis)confirmation, the author offers a more complete account of the assimilation of EISs, and provide several avenues for future empirical and theoretical research on enterprise technology assimilation.Originality/valueThe extant research that there is on the assimilation of the EISs focuses more on the organizational ‚Äì as opposed to individual ‚Äì level determinants of EISs assimilation and largely considers the functional ‚Äì rather than psychological and social ‚Äì drivers. This article addresses these important, yet understudied, factors to offer a more nuanced account of EISs assimilation.",

        "published": "2023-5-19",
        "citations": 2,
        "abstract": "The Faustmann formula, equivalent to the land expectation value (LEV), yields the present value, starting with bare land, of an infinite series of future timber rotations for a stand. If this formula is used to find the rotation age that maximizes the present value, a lower annual harvest will result when compared to a maximum sustained yield (MSY) regime for an ownership with many stands. However, the LEV is strongly preferred by economists. This is the LEV vs. rents paradox. Herein, this paper demonstrates that an infinite series of annual harvests for an ownership under an even flow regime, discounted to the present using any interest rate, will provide the same optimal rotation age as the time of the peak MAI for a single stand, though with different estimates for the profitability, depending on the interest rate. Thus, rotations producing the MSY and the maximum financial return are identical when analyzed at the ownership scale but are not the same when based on the analysis at the stand scale using the Faustmann formula (LEV). This is the solution to the paradox. The formulas for internal rate of return (IRR) and the land valuation for transaction purposes are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Financial time series and other human-driven, non-natural processes are known to exhibit fat-tailed outcome distributions. That is, such processes demonstrate a greater tendency for extreme outcomes than the normal distribution or other natural distributional processes would predict. We examine the mathematical expectation, or simply ‚Äúexpectation‚Äù, traditionally the probability-weighted outcome, regarded since the seventeenth century as the mathematical definition of ‚Äúexpectation‚Äù. However, when considering the ‚Äúexpectation‚Äù of an individual confronted with a finite sequence of outcomes, particularly existential outcomes (e.g., a trader with a limited time to perform or lose his position in a trading operation), we find this individual ‚Äúexpects‚Äù the median terminal outcome over those finite trials, with the classical seventeenth-century definition being the asymptotic limit as trials increase. Since such finite-sequence ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù often differ in values from the classic one, so do the optimal allocations (e.g., growth-optimal). We examine these for fat-tailed distributions. The focus is on implementation, and the techniques described can be applied to all distributional forms. We make no assertion that the empirical data for any financial time series comports to the generalized hyperbolic distribution (GHD), which we will use as a proxy of any heavy-tailed distribution herein. Rather, we have selected the GHD to highlight the process for determining expectation and other important time-dependent metrics in existential contests, using the GHD as a generic proxy for the specific distributional form an implementor of the presented technique might ascribe to the empirical data.",

        "abstract": "Generalised moves to online and more flexible delivery modes of teaching have challenged the perceptions and expectations of university educators worldwide. Congruence around educator role expectations, held by both the educator and their students, therefore is central to educator wellbeing, and by default, student success in a changing university environment. Metaphorical analysis is a way to understand perceptions, expectations, and the realities of university teaching. Extending the work of Saban et al. (2007), this mixed methods study of metaphors of university educators from student and educator perspectives found that while educators and students were aligned in conceptualizing teachers, there were increasing expectations on educators to demonstrate higher levels of humanistic personal qualities while at the same time being experts, accredited teachers, and engaging content creators. Educators however saw themselves as something different to how students see them, pointing to a vulnerability for educator wellbeing. The implications suggest more institutional support is needed for the ‚Äòbeing and doing‚Äô of teaching and to find better ways to align the expectations of students, universities, and educators. For early career educators, recognising the tension between the reality and aspiration of being a teacher, will go some way towards maintaining educator wellbeing.\n¬†",
