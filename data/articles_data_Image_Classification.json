        "abstract": "Texture play important role in image description process. Texture classification is one of the problems which have been paid much attention on by computer vision scientists in last decade. If texture classification is done accurately, it can be used in many problems such as skin detection, surface defect detection, medical image analysis, gender identification, human identification, etc. Since now, many approaches are proposed to perform it. Most of them have tried to extract discriminative features to separate different texture types accurately. This paper has proposed an approach based on energy analysis of some efficient image descriptors such as median binary pattern, Local binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence matrix. Next, by concatenating extracted features, a discriminative feature vector is defined. Finally, classifier is used to classify texture types. Although, this approach is a general one and is could be used in different applications. In the result part the proposed approach has been evaluated on some benchmark dataset. Next, the results have been compared with some of state-of-the-art approaches to prove the quality of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the background of the novel coronavirus outbreak and the role of CT scanning in diagnosis, as well as the importance of automated CT image analysis system. COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has caused millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide since it broke out in Wuhan, China, in early 2020. CT scan is a commonly used diagnostic means to help doctors determine the extent and location of lung lesions, but due to the large number of COVID-19 patients, doctors have a large workload, so automated CT image analysis system is needed to assist doctors in rapid diagnosis. With the continuous training process, the accuracy of the training set of automated CT image analysis system is gradually stabilized at 90%. The accuracy of the test set exceeds 85%, and the prediction effect is good. The loss of training set and test set became smaller and the training accuracy gradually improved. According to the confusion matrix, 6 CT images that should have been COVID-19 were predicted to be non-COVID-19, 57 CT images that should have been non-COVID-19 were predicted to be COVID-19, and the remaining images were predicted correctly, and the prediction effect of the model was good, which could predict the COVID-19 images more accurately. The application of automated CT image analysis system can greatly reduce the work burden of doctors, improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis, and provide strong technical support for the prevention, control and treatment of COVID-19. At the same time, the continuous optimization and improvement of the system will also provide more effective technical means for future epidemic prevention and control and medical diagnosis. However, there are still some problems and challenges in the application of automated CT image analysis system. For example, there may be bias in the models training data, resulting in inaccurate model predictions. At the same time, the case data in different regions are quite different, so targeted training and optimization are needed. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve and optimize the system to improve its prediction effect and reliability. In conclusion, the application of automated CT image analysis system provides strong technical support for the prevention, control and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, which can quickly and accurately diagnose lung lesions and provide better treatment and care for patients. With the continuous development and improvement of the technology, the application prospect of the system will be broader and make greater contributions to the cause of human health.",

        "abstract": "The batch clustering algorithm for classification application requires the initial parameters and also has a drifting phenomenon for the stochastic process. The initial parameters are critical for the clustering to con-verge to the partial optimum. The drifting phenomenon in original batch clustering still has space to be improved thus to speed up the convergence based on the initial parameters. This paper proposes an unsupervised clustering method by addressing these two issues. Firstly, the estimation method for the initial parameters has been given in preliminary with a hierarchical manner of principal component analysis (PCA). The nonlinear parameters have been estimated based on a mathematical connection between PCA and clusters membership. With initial parameters, the drifting issue is addressed by combing the gradient descent and the batch clustering on an auxiliary objective to refine the initial parameters. The efficiency of the clustering process is proved based on the relationship between two quadratic functions followed by a justification. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated with the statistical F measure in classification application. The validation results show that the efficiency of the proposed gradient descent batch clustering has been improved significantly with trade-off to the accuracy in comparison of the original algorithms under the mean squared error (MSE) criterion.",

Structural classification is the area of research that this thesis focuses on. We use visualizations of proteins to build a machine learning class prediction model, that successfully classifies proteins using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) framework. SCOP is a well-researched classification with many approaches using a representation of a proteins secondary structure in a linear chain of structures. This thesis uses a novel approach of rendering a three dimensional visualization of the protein itself and then applying image based machine learning to determine a protein’s SCOP classification. The resulting convolutional neural network (CNN) method has achieved average accuracies in the range 78-87% on the 25PDB dataset, which is better than or equal to the existing methods.</p>",

Being able to extract effective features from different images is very important for image classification, but it is challenging due to high variations across images. By integrating existing well-developed feature descriptors into learning algorithms, it is possible to automatically extract informative high-level features for image classification. As a learning algorithm with a flexible representation and good global search ability, genetic programming can achieve this. In this paper, a new genetic programming-based feature learning approach is developed to automatically select and combine five existing well-developed descriptors to extract high-level features for image classification. The new approach can automatically learn various numbers of global and/or local features from different types of images. The results show that the new approach achieves significantly better classification performance in almost all the comparisons on eight data sets of varying difficulty. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of the new approach to finding the most effective feature descriptors or combinations of them to extract discriminative features for different classification tasks.",

By integrating existing well-developed feature descriptors into learning algorithms, it is possible to automatically extract informative high-level features for image classification. As a learning algorithm with a flexible representation and good global search ability, genetic programming can achieve this. In this paper, a new genetic programming-based feature learning approach is developed to automatically select and combine five existing well-developed descriptors to extract high-level features for image classification. The new approach can automatically learn various numbers of global and/or local features from different types of images. The results show that the new approach achieves significantly better classification performance in almost all the comparisons on eight data sets of varying difficulty. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of the new approach to finding the most effective feature descriptors or combinations of them to extract discriminative features for different classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Non-linear activation functions are one of the main parts of deep neural network architectures. The choice of the activation function can affect model speed, performance and convergence. Most popular activation functions don't have any trainable parameters and don't alter during the training. We propose different activation functions with and without trainable parameters. Said activation functions have a number of advantages and disadvantages. We'll be testing the performance of said activation functions and comparing the results with widely known activation function ReLU. We assume that the activation functions with trainable parameters can outperform functions without ones, because the trainable parameters allow the model to \"select'' the type of each of the activation functions itself, however, this strongly depends on the architecture of the deep neural network and the activation function itself.",

Structural classification is the area of research that this thesis focuses on. We use visualizations of proteins to build a machine learning class prediction model, that successfully classifies proteins using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) framework. SCOP is a well-researched classification with many approaches using a representation of a proteins secondary structure in a linear chain of structures. This thesis uses a novel approach of rendering a three dimensional visualization of the protein itself and then applying image based machine learning to determine a protein’s SCOP classification. The resulting convolutional neural network (CNN) method has achieved average accuracies in the range 78-87% on the 25PDB dataset, which is better than or equal to the existing methods.</p>",

Since 2014, profound amount of work began to make better convolutional architectures, yielding generous additions in different benchmarks. Albeit expanded model size and computational cost will, in general, mean prompt quality increases for most undertakings but, the architectures now need to have some additional information to increase the performance. We show empirical evidence that with the amalgamation of content-based image similarity and deep learning models, we can provide the flow of information which can be used in making clustered learning possible. We show how parallel training of sub-dataset clusters not only reduces the cost of computation but also increases the benchmark accuracies by 5-11 percent.",

Thus, traditional methods are difficult to be used for image encryption as their pseudo-random sequences have a small period without real modification, which causes a restriction in the security and en-cryption of the image. \nDifferent types of JPEG2000 encryption techniques are addressed and discussed in secured and compressed (friendly) based aspects. Moreover, a study of JPEG2000 codec in terms of encryption is achieved in order to be a good tutorial for researchers who have experience in image or video without crypto and selective encryption expertise. Finally, it is also suitable for beginners in the field of image and video security with good expertise in the encryption field. \nThe importance and sensitive JPEG2000 codec structure is described in a manner that can help researchers to identify steps, requirements, and techniques that should be used to secure image and video content.\nPACS: 0000, 1111 2000 MSC: 0000, 1111",
