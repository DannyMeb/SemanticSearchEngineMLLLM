A common scenario is the following: data is recorded from some (digital) sensor device, and we know (or assume) that there is some “underlying” signal contained in this data, which is obscured by noise. The goal is to extract this signal, but the noise causes this task to be impossible: we can never know the actual underlying signal. We must make mathematical assumptions that make this taskp possible at all. Uncertainty is formalized through the mathematical machinery of probability, and decisions are made that find the optimal choices under these assumptions. This chapter explores the main methods by which these optimal choices are made in DSP and machine learning.",

Technical papers related to machine learning algorithms applications have being increasingly published in many oil and gas disciplines over the last five years, revolutionizing the way engineers approach to their works, and sharing innovating solutions that contributes to an increase in efficiency.\nIn this paper, Machine Learning models are built to predict inverse rate of penetration (ROPI) and surface torque for a well located at Gulf of Mexico shallow waters. Three type of analysis were performed. Pre-drill analysis, predicting the parameters without any data of the target well in the database. Drilling analysis, running the model every sixty meters, updating the database with information of the target well and predicting the parameters ahead the bit. Sensitivity parameter optimization analysis was performed iterating weight on bit and rotary speed values as model inputs in order identify the optimum combination to deliver the best drilling performance under the given conditions.\nThe Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) library in Python programming language environment, was used to build the models. Model performance was satisfactory, overcoming the challenge of using drilling parameters input manually by drilling bit engineers. The database was built with data from different fields and wells. Two databases were created to build the models, one of the models did not consider logging while drilling (LWD) data in order to determine its importance on the predictions.\nPre-drill surface torque prediction showed better performance than ROPI. Predictions ahead the bit performance was good both for torque and ROPI. Sensitivity parameter optimization showed better resolution with the database that includes LWD data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research introduces a novel methodology for optimizing Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) by synergistically integrating them with traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Utilizing ensemble methods, represented by the equation yensemble = M ∈M wM · yM , and stacking techniques, the study formulates a unique hybrid predictive system. The research rigorously explores the properties of individual non-Bayesian models, establishing their feature importance , generalization error, and optimization landscapes through lemmas and theorems. It proves the optimality of the proposed ensemble method and the robustness of the stacking technique. Feature integration is mathematically formulated to achieve significant information gain. Additionally, in synthesizing the findings, our research corroborates the mathematical formulations underlying ensemble methods while offering nuanced insights into the limitations of hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, the ensemble method empirically validates the ensemble generalization error equation Eensemble = n i=1 w 2 i ϵi + 2 n i=1 j̸ =i wiwjρ(Mi, Mj)ϵiϵj, showcasing the ensemble’s minimized generalization error. This is further optimized through the Lagrangian function L(w1, w2,. .. , wn, λ) = Eensemble + λ 1 − n i=1 wi , allowing for adaptive weight adjustments. Feature integration solidifies these results by emphasizing the second-order conditions for optimality, including stationarity (∇L = 0) and positive definiteness of the Hessian matrix. Conversely, hyperparameter tuning indicates a subdued impact in improving Expected Improvement (EI), represented by EI(x) = E[max(f (x) − f (x *), 0)]. Overall, the ensemble method stands out as a robust, algorithmically optimized approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. The field of materials science and engineering is constantly evolving, and new methods are being developed to improve our understanding of the relationship between microstructure and properties. One such method is crystal plasticity (CP) modeling, which is widely used for predicting the mechanical properties of crystals and phases. However, determining the constitutive parameters for CP models has been a significant challenge, with current methods relying on either direct chemical composition or inverse fitting, both of which can be time-consuming and lack accuracy. In this study, we propose an automated, advanced, and more efficient method for determining constitutive parameters by using a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method coupled with machine learning. Our proposed method is applied to two widely used CP models, and the reference data for the calibration is the stress-strain curve from tensile tests. The results of the automated calibration process are then compared to numerical simulation results of CP models with known parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed method.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nOptimization of indirect shoot regeneration protocols is one of the key prerequisites for the development of Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation and/or genome editing in Passiflora caerulea. Comprehensive knowledge of indirect shoot regeneration and optimized protocol can be obtained by the application of a combination of machine learning (ML) and optimization algorithms.\n\nMaterials and methods\nIn the present investigation, the indirect shoot regeneration responses (i.e., de novo shoot regeneration rate, the number of de novo shoots, and length of de novo shoots) of P. caerulea were predicted based on different types and concentrations of PGRs (i.e., TDZ, BAP, PUT, KIN, and IBA) as well as callus types (i.e., callus derived from different explants including leaf, node, and internode) using generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and random forest (RF). Moreover, the developed models were integrated into the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the concentration of PGRs and callus types for maximizing indirect shoot regeneration responses. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the importance of each input variable on the studied parameters.\n\nResults\nThe results showed that both algorithms (RF and GRNN) had high predictive accuracy (R2 > 0.86) in both training and testing sets for modeling all studied parameters. Based on the results of optimization process, the highest de novo shoot regeneration rate (100%) would be obtained from callus derived from nodal segments cultured in the medium supplemented with 0.77 mg/L BAP plus 2.41 mg/L PUT plus 0.06 mg/L IBA. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed the explant-dependent impact of exogenous application of PGRs on indirect de novo shoot regeneration.\n\nConclusions\nA combination of ML (GRNN and RF) and GA can display a forward-thinking aid to optimize and predict in vitro culture systems and consequentially cope with several challenges faced currently in Passiflora tissue culture.\n",

        "abstract": "The main purpose of this paper is to propose a novel optimization model with a new machine learning approach in the first section to achieve the best results in financial institutions in the second section. Since the constancy of efficacy derived from parametric and non-parametric is not significant, this paper provides a scientific assessment at the optimization section and proposes a novel combined parametric and non-parametric model which will be a new experiment in literature perception. A scientific assessment of banks based on a combination of the efficiency measurement method of CCR(Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes model) or CRS(Constant Return to Scale) BCC(Banker, Charnes, and Cooper model) or VRS (Variable Return to Scale) in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), as well as Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) for 65 banks during Feb to July 2020, are introduced. For analyzing the performance of the parametric and non-parametric approaches we have considered the linear regression and Unreplicated Linear Functional Relationship (ULFR). At the machine learning section, a novel four-layers data mining filtering pre-processes for selected supervised classification as well as unsupervised clustering algorithms to increase the accuracy and to remove unrelated attributes and data are applied. For the four kinds of preprocessing approaches of unsupervised attributes, supervised attributes, supervised instances, and unsupervised instances, we have chosen discretization, attribute selection, stratified remove folds, and resample filters respectively. Based on the nature of the suggested financial institution's dataset and attributes, the most appropriate preprocessing filter in each layer to achieve the highest performance is suggested. Finally, the superior bank, best performance model, and the most accurate algorithm are introduced. The results indicate that the bank number 56 is the superior bank. Among the proposed techniques, the novel recommended CVS compared with CCR-BCC and SFA models, has a more positive correlation with profit risk, and show a higher coefficient of determination values. Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO) algorithm receives the highest accuracy in all four suggested filtering layers.",

        "abstract": "Recently, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have made these techniques increasingly prominent. Companies and institutions have begun investing in healthcare research to improve the accuracy of disease prediction because of its widespread popularity and effective pattern detection and categorization capabilities. However, there are numerous difficulties that arise while employing these methods. The lack of a huge data set for medical pictures is one of the biggest challenges. This study aims to provide a reasonable introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, beginning with theoretical foundations and progressing to practical implementations. Deep learning (DL) has become increasingly popular due to a number of computer science discoveries, according to a new study. To get a better grasp of neural networks, the next step was to familiarise ourselves with the principles. That's why convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning are used. This gives us a better idea of why deep learning is advancing so quickly in so many different application domains, including medical image processing. Key Words: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNN, Cancer, Algorithm, ANN.",
