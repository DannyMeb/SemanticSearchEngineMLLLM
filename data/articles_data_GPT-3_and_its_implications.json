        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own flawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI’s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5× semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.",

        "abstract": "Dear Editor,\nSince the dawn of the technological revolution, natural language processing (NLP) has been an interesting prospect for different professions. Chat GPT, a system developed by open artificial intelligence (AI), is the latest innovation that generates text in a human-like language format. It is considered to have learned the entire internet, enabling it to create responses containing almost accurate information in answer to the prompt provided by the user1. In this letter, we would like to discuss some key areas where chat GPT can play its role in medicine.\nCancer is a global healthcare crisis where a vast amount of money is annually spent, search of cure and drug development. Improvements in cancer therapeutics have increased life expectancy, which has resulted in patients requiring extended support and monitoring thereby increasing the load of healthcare professionals. In this scenario, chat GPT based chatbots which are automated artificial intelligence tools that can serve as an intermediate element between doctors and patients. They can facilitate history taking, especially of sensitive and intimate details that patients might be shy of talking about. On the other hand, these chatbots could help in decreasing costs and burdens related to healthcare resources. It can also reduce the workload of doctors by reducing the number of minor consultations which can be done by the artificially intelligent chatbot and allow the resources to be directed towards more sicker patients who might need more attention and care2.\nThe pandemic has made the world realize the importance of remote diagnostic systems, which are not only fast, reliable, and pocket friendly but have also increased access of healthcare to disadvantaged populations. NLP systems make use of linguistics analysis and deep learning to obtain vital information from a patient prompt detailing symptom, their onset, and demographic details (3). Chat GPT works via language processing can be linked to a text messaging system where the patient can provide their details and it would suggest possible diagnoses and recommend if the patient should visit a doctor or the symptoms would go away with home remedy/over-the-counter medications. This would be possible by training the algorithm on a larger set of medical data and human surveillance to improve efficacy over a period of time. This potentially would decrease the burden of primary care providers and benefit a larger population.\n---Continue",

        "abstract": "Various studies show that when learners are able to get instruction in their mother tongue, they are able to understand technical information easier. Learners that are able to perform better at school are also able to eventually enter the workforce as educated professionals. In a country like South Africa, most learners cannot afford mathematics tutoring. Having access to tutoring on a platform like WhatsApp provides disadvantaged learners with the same opportunities as their more privileged counterparts. This paper investigates the development of a mathematics tutoring bot, Prof Pi, that is able to provide tutoring in a number of languages used in Africa besides English including Afrikaans, Zulu, Kiswahili, and Arabic.",

        "abstract": "Рассматривается информационная безопасность в эпоху Индустрии 4.0 через призму концепции Рассела Акоффа – знаменитой пирамиды DIKW, в которой знания, как известно, являются одной из страт данной пирамиды, вышестоящей над информацией и добавляющей по отношению к категории информация механизм её использования, отвечая на вопрос «как?». То есть, ставится вопрос не о защите данных и информации, а о защите знаний как категории более ценной, требования по защите которых должны быть на порядок выше требований по защите информации. В этой связи возникает еще и дополнительный аспект информационной безопасности – появление псевдознаний, псевдонаук, которые в больших объемах может генерировать искусственный интеллект. Это требует рассмотрения второго из двух базовых аспектов информационной безопасности – защита человека и общества от воздействия на них ложной и деструктивной информации, псевдознаний и псевдонаук, что становится всё более очевидным в настоящее время, по мере углубления вхождения ведущих мировых держав в информационное общество, индикатором чего является необратимое развитие цифровой экономики.\nInformation security in the era of Industry 4.0 is considered through the prism of Russell Akoff's concept – the famous DIKW pyramid, in which knowledge, as is known, is one of the strata of this pyramid, standing above information and adding a mechanism for its use in relation to the information category, answering the question \"how?\". The question is not about data protection, but about knowledge protection, since knowledge is a more valuable category and therefore the requirements for knowledge protection should be an order of magnitude higher than when protecting information. In this regard, there is also an additional aspect of information security – the emergence of pseudoscience, pseudoscience, which artificial intelligence can generate in large volumes. This requires consideration of the second of the two basic aspects of information security – the protection of man and society from the impact on them of false and destructive information, pseudoscience and pseudoscience.",

        "abstract": "In the last few year advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have made it possible to generate high-quality text, audio, and visual content automatically for a wide range of application areas including research and education. However, designing and customizing an effective R&D tool capable of providing necessary tool-specific output, and breaking down complex research tasks requires a great deal of expertise and effort, and is often a time-consuming and expensive process. Using existing Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and foundational models, it is now possible to leverage the Large Language Model GPTs already trained on specific datasets to be effective in common research and development workflow. In this paper, we develop and test a customized version of autonomous pretrained generative transformer which is an experimental open-source project built on top of GPT-4 language model that chains together LLM \"thoughts\", to autonomously achieve and regress towards specifics goals. Our implementation, referred to as TAUCHI-GPT, which uses an automated approach to text generation that leverages deep learning and output reflection to create high-quality text, visual and auditory output, achieve common research and development tasks. TAUCHI-GPT is based on the GPT-4 architecture and connects to Stable Diffusion and ElevenLabs to input and output complex multimodal streams through chain prompting. Moreover, using the Google Search API, TAUCHI-GPT can also scrap online repositories to understand, learn and deconstruct complex research tasks, identify relevant information, and plan appropriate courses of action by implementing a chain of thought (CoT).",

Most existing VTG models are trained on extensive annotated video-text pairs, a process that not only introduces human biases from the queries but also incurs significant computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose VTG-GPT, a GPT-based method for zero-shot VTG without training or fine-tuning. To reduce prejudice in the original query, we employ Baichuan2 to generate debiased queries. To lessen redundant information in videos, we apply MiniGPT-v2 to transform visual content into more precise captions. Finally, we devise the proposal generator and post-processing to produce accurate segments from debiased queries and image captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTG-GPT significantly outperforms SOTA methods in zero-shot settings and surpasses unsupervised approaches. More notably, it achieves competitive performance comparable to supervised methods. The code is available on GitHub.",

In this study, we conduct an evaluation of text quality using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score for two prominent GPT engines: Davinci-003 and Davinci. We generated questions and answers related to Python from internet sources as input data. The BLEU score comparison revealed that Davinci-003 achieved a higher score of 0.035, while Davinci attained a score of 0.021. Additionally, for the response times, with Davinci demonstrating an average response time of 4.20 seconds, while Davinci-003 exhibited a slightly longer average response time of 6.59 seconds. The decision of whether to use Davinci-003 or Davinci for chatbot development should be made based on the specific project requirements. If prioritizing text quality is paramount, Davinci-003 emerges as the superior choice due to its higher BLEU score. However, if faster response times are of greater importance, Davinci may be the more suitable option. Ultimately, the selection should align with the unique needs and objectives of the chatbot development project.",

The models were tested on three editions of the MFE from: Spring 2022, Autumn 2022, and Spring 2023 in two language versions—English and Polish. The accuracies of both models were compared and the relationships between the correctness of answers with the answer’s metrics were investigated. The study demonstrated that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in all three examinations regardless of the language used. GPT-4 achieved mean accuracies of 79.7% for both Polish and English versions, passing all MFE versions. GPT-3.5 had mean accuracies of 54.8% for Polish and 60.3% for English, passing none and 2 of 3 Polish versions for temperature parameter equal to 0 and 1 respectively while passing all English versions regardless of the temperature parameter value. GPT-4 score was mostly lower than the average score of a medical student. There was a statistically significant correlation between the correctness of the answers and the index of difficulty for both models. The overall accuracy of both models was still suboptimal and worse than the average for medical students. This emphasizes the need for further improvements in LLMs before they can be reliably deployed in medical settings. These findings suggest an increasing potential for the usage of LLMs in terms of medical education.",

        "abstract": " Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model in applying Fleischner Society recommendations to lung nodules. Methods: We generated 10 lung nodule descriptions for each of the 12 nodule categories from the Fleischner Society guidelines, incorporating them into a single fictitious report (n = 120). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were prompted to make follow-up recommendations based on the reports. We then incorporated the full guidelines into the prompts and re-submitted them. Finally, we re-submitted the prompts to a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model. Results were analyzed using binary accuracy analysis in R. Results: GPT-3.5 accuracy in applying Fleischner Society guidelines was 0.058 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.12). GPT-4 accuracy was improved at 0.15 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.23; P = .02 for accuracy comparison). In recommending PET-CT and/or biopsy, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had an F-score of 0.00. After explicitly including the Fleischner Society guidelines in the prompt, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 significantly improved their accuracy to 0.42 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.51; P < .001) and to 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.74; P < .001), respectively. GPT-4 remained significantly better than GPT-3.5 ( P < .001). The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model accuracy was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.55), not different from the GPT-3.5 model with guidelines included ( P = .53). Conclusion: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 performed poorly in applying widely known guidelines and never correctly recommended biopsy. Flawed knowledge and reasoning both contributed to their poor performance. While GPT-4 was more accurate than GPT-3.5, its inaccuracy rate was unacceptable for clinical practice. These results underscore the limitations of large language models for knowledge and reasoning-based tasks. ",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that allows machines to process large amounts of data and make predictions. OpenAI's GPT-3 AI is one such example, which has been trained on data available up until June 2021, and had no access to more recent data nor was connected to the internet. The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the potential of AI in forecasting the escalation of the 2022 Ukrainian war and to determine whether such contribution justifies co-authorship. In a stage-gate methodology, GPT-3's capability for generating future scenarios with estimated probabilities was used to check their consistency and define drivers for evaluating their presence before deciding on AI co-authorship in this publication. The results showed that GPT-3 accurately described the open war as one of the scenarios; however, its capability for predicting the future was limited, and internal consistency of generated scenarios could be improved. Overall, this study demonstrated that GPT-3 has proved itself as powerful for generating future scenarios and re-writing abstracts, like this one. According to our stage-gate approach, GPT-3 did not qualify for co-authorship in this publication. We recommend further scientific discussion and updating best practices and journal guidelines with clear guidelines on AI contributions for future scientific papers.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nThe potential of artificial intelligence (AI)–based large language models, such as ChatGPT, has gained significant attention in the medical field. This enthusiasm is driven not only by recent breakthroughs and improved accessibility, but also by the prospect of democratizing medical knowledge and promoting equitable health care. However, the performance of ChatGPT is substantially influenced by the input language, and given the growing public trust in this AI tool compared to that in traditional sources of information, investigating its medical accuracy across different languages is of particular importance.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to compare the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with that of medical students on the written German medical licensing examination.\n\n\nMethods\nTo assess GPT-3.5’s and GPT-4's medical proficiency, we used 937 original multiple-choice questions from 3 written German medical licensing examinations in October 2021, April 2022, and October 2022.\n\n\nResults\nGPT-4 achieved an average score of 85% and ranked in the 92.8th, 99.5th, and 92.6th percentiles among medical students who took the same examinations in October 2021, April 2022, and October 2022, respectively. This represents a substantial improvement of 27% compared to GPT-3.5, which only passed 1 out of the 3 examinations. While GPT-3.5 performed well in psychiatry questions, GPT-4 exhibited strengths in internal medicine and surgery but showed weakness in academic research.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe study results highlight ChatGPT’s remarkable improvement from moderate (GPT-3.5) to high competency (GPT-4) in answering medical licensing examination questions in German. While GPT-4’s predecessor (GPT-3.5) was imprecise and inconsistent, it demonstrates considerable potential to improve medical education and patient care, provided that medically trained users critically evaluate its results. As the replacement of search engines by AI tools seems possible in the future, further studies with nonprofessional questions are needed to assess the safety and accuracy of ChatGPT for the general population.\n",

AutoGPT experiences of users can be characterized by learning programs, autonomous applications, conducting research, and writing reports. The results of this study showed that content creation is the most important purpose of using Auto-GPT. As independent research functions of Auto-GPT, users also emphasize data summarization and information organization. However, the participants also pointed out the token limit (inefficiency), forgetting generated tools, and iteration as some prominent limitations of Auto-GPT.

We refine the results using filtering and mapping rules to align with our schema. The manually generated graph serves as the ground truth for evaluation, and we explore different methods to enhance its accuracy through knowledge graph completion techniques. As a result, we emphasize the potential of employing ChatGPT for automated knowledge graph construction within the Chinese medical domain.

Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine. The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain. There are various risk factors for the development of peptic ulcer disease, but the most important ones are Helicobacter pylori infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients generally present with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer bleeding. Acid suppressant therapy, H. pylori eradication, and avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the cornerstones of treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer bleeding could be life-threatening. It is managed by appropriate supportive care, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy, and endoscopic homeostasis. Trans arterial embolization (TAE), Herbal treated and surgery are rarely required if endoscopic therapy fails.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the potential benefits of employing generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) in recreational tourism, the difficulties that arise when implementing such technology, the impact it has on tourist behaviour, and the ways it can be utilised in recreational tourism management. The original aspect of the study is that it is the first to give detailed information about the use of GPT in recreational tourism. ChatGPT was used as an interviewer in the study. ChatGPT is a software application that utilizes the high-powered machine learning software called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3), developed by the OpenAI organization. Six questions were posed on the ChatGPT query screen (https://chat.openai.com/chat). The interview queries were prepared with reference to the study by Fusté-Forné and Orea-Giner (2023). The question statements in this study on the use of GPT in gastronomy tourism were changed to recreational tourism. ChatGPT's replies were tabulated and presented descriptively. Inferences and suggestions were made in line with the answers given by ChatGPT. The study showed that using GPT technology in recreational-based tourism can offer better customer interaction, decision-making, and a personalized travel experience. ChatGPT underlined that new technologies continue to evolve, and recreational-based tourism will become more personalized, informative, and immersive, ultimately enhancing the overall travel experience, and contributing to the growth and sustainability of the tourism industry. ChatGPT also noted GPT models have the potential to shape and enhance the entire travel experience for tourists, from the initial planning stages to the actual trip itself. Although GPT makes significant contributions to recreational tourism management and recreational tourists, there are deficiencies in ethical, privacy, and authenticity concerns.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India.\n\n\nObjective\nThis comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models.\n\n\nResults\nIt was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.\n",

In June 2023, text-based multiple-choice questions were submitted to GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5. The AAO provides the percentage of humans who selected the correct answer, which was analyzed for comparison. All questions were classified by 10 subspecialties and 3 practice areas (diagnostics/clinics, medical treatment, surgery). Out of 1023 questions, GPT-4.0 achieved the best score (82.4%), followed by humans (75.7%) and GPT-3.5 (65.9%), with significant difference in accuracy rates (always P < 0.0001). Both GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 showed the worst results in surgery-related questions (74.6% and 57.0% respectively). For difficult questions (answered incorrectly by > 50% of humans), both GPT models favorably compared to humans, without reaching significancy. The word count for answers provided by GPT-4.0 was significantly lower than those produced by GPT-3.5 (160 ± 56 and 206 ± 77 respectively, P < 0.0001); however, incorrect responses were longer (P < 0.02). GPT-4.0 represented a substantial improvement over GPT-3.5, achieving better performance than humans in an AAO BCSC self-assessment test. However, ChatGPT is still limited by inconsistency across different practice areas, especially when it comes to surgery.",
