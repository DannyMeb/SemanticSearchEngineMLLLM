        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own flawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI’s models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5× semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.",

        "abstract": "Dear Editor,\nSince the dawn of the technological revolution, natural language processing (NLP) has been an interesting prospect for different professions. Chat GPT, a system developed by open artificial intelligence (AI), is the latest innovation that generates text in a human-like language format. It is considered to have learned the entire internet, enabling it to create responses containing almost accurate information in answer to the prompt provided by the user1. In this letter, we would like to discuss some key areas where chat GPT can play its role in medicine.\nCancer is a global healthcare crisis where a vast amount of money is annually spent, search of cure and drug development. Improvements in cancer therapeutics have increased life expectancy, which has resulted in patients requiring extended support and monitoring thereby increasing the load of healthcare professionals. In this scenario, chat GPT based chatbots which are automated artificial intelligence tools that can serve as an intermediate element between doctors and patients. They can facilitate history taking, especially of sensitive and intimate details that patients might be shy of talking about. On the other hand, these chatbots could help in decreasing costs and burdens related to healthcare resources. It can also reduce the workload of doctors by reducing the number of minor consultations which can be done by the artificially intelligent chatbot and allow the resources to be directed towards more sicker patients who might need more attention and care2.\nThe pandemic has made the world realize the importance of remote diagnostic systems, which are not only fast, reliable, and pocket friendly but have also increased access of healthcare to disadvantaged populations. NLP systems make use of linguistics analysis and deep learning to obtain vital information from a patient prompt detailing symptom, their onset, and demographic details (3). Chat GPT works via language processing can be linked to a text messaging system where the patient can provide their details and it would suggest possible diagnoses and recommend if the patient should visit a doctor or the symptoms would go away with home remedy/over-the-counter medications. This would be possible by training the algorithm on a larger set of medical data and human surveillance to improve efficacy over a period of time. This potentially would decrease the burden of primary care providers and benefit a larger population.\n---Continue",

        "abstract": "Various studies show that when learners are able to get instruction in their mother tongue, they are able to understand technical information easier. Learners that are able to perform better at school are also able to eventually enter the workforce as educated professionals. In a country like South Africa, most learners cannot afford mathematics tutoring. Having access to tutoring on a platform like WhatsApp provides disadvantaged learners with the same opportunities as their more privileged counterparts. This paper investigates the development of a mathematics tutoring bot, Prof Pi, that is able to provide tutoring in a number of languages used in Africa besides English including Afrikaans, Zulu, Kiswahili, and Arabic.",

        "abstract": "Рассматривается информационная безопасность в эпоху Индустрии 4.0 через призму концепции Рассела Акоффа – знаменитой пирамиды DIKW, в которой знания, как известно, являются одной из страт данной пирамиды, вышестоящей над информацией и добавляющей по отношению к категории информация механизм её использования, отвечая на вопрос «как?». То есть, ставится вопрос не о защите данных и информации, а о защите знаний как категории более ценной, требования по защите которых должны быть на порядок выше требований по защите информации. В этой связи возникает еще и дополнительный аспект информационной безопасности – появление псевдознаний, псевдонаук, которые в больших объемах может генерировать искусственный интеллект. Это требует рассмотрения второго из двух базовых аспектов информационной безопасности – защита человека и общества от воздействия на них ложной и деструктивной информации, псевдознаний и псевдонаук, что становится всё более очевидным в настоящее время, по мере углубления вхождения ведущих мировых держав в информационное общество, индикатором чего является необратимое развитие цифровой экономики.\nInformation security in the era of Industry 4.0 is considered through the prism of Russell Akoff's concept – the famous DIKW pyramid, in which knowledge, as is known, is one of the strata of this pyramid, standing above information and adding a mechanism for its use in relation to the information category, answering the question \"how?\". The question is not about data protection, but about knowledge protection, since knowledge is a more valuable category and therefore the requirements for knowledge protection should be an order of magnitude higher than when protecting information. In this regard, there is also an additional aspect of information security – the emergence of pseudoscience, pseudoscience, which artificial intelligence can generate in large volumes. This requires consideration of the second of the two basic aspects of information security – the protection of man and society from the impact on them of false and destructive information, pseudoscience and pseudoscience.",

        "abstract": "In the last few year advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have made it possible to generate high-quality text, audio, and visual content automatically for a wide range of application areas including research and education. However, designing and customizing an effective R&D tool capable of providing necessary tool-specific output, and breaking down complex research tasks requires a great deal of expertise and effort, and is often a time-consuming and expensive process. Using existing Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and foundational models, it is now possible to leverage the Large Language Model GPTs already trained on specific datasets to be effective in common research and development workflow. In this paper, we develop and test a customized version of autonomous pretrained generative transformer which is an experimental open-source project built on top of GPT-4 language model that chains together LLM \"thoughts\", to autonomously achieve and regress towards specifics goals. Our implementation, referred to as TAUCHI-GPT, which uses an automated approach to text generation that leverages deep learning and output reflection to create high-quality text, visual and auditory output, achieve common research and development tasks. TAUCHI-GPT is based on the GPT-4 architecture and connects to Stable Diffusion and ElevenLabs to input and output complex multimodal streams through chain prompting. Moreover, using the Google Search API, TAUCHI-GPT can also scrap online repositories to understand, learn and deconstruct complex research tasks, identify relevant information, and plan appropriate courses of action by implementing a chain of thought (CoT).",

Most existing VTG models are trained on extensive annotated video-text pairs, a process that not only introduces human biases from the queries but also incurs significant computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose VTG-GPT, a GPT-based method for zero-shot VTG without training or fine-tuning. To reduce prejudice in the original query, we employ Baichuan2 to generate debiased queries. To lessen redundant information in videos, we apply MiniGPT-v2 to transform visual content into more precise captions. Finally, we devise the proposal generator and post-processing to produce accurate segments from debiased queries and image captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTG-GPT significantly outperforms SOTA methods in zero-shot settings and surpasses unsupervised approaches. More notably, it achieves competitive performance comparable to supervised methods. The code is available on GitHub.",

In this study, we conduct an evaluation of text quality using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score for two prominent GPT engines: Davinci-003 and Davinci. We generated questions and answers related to Python from internet sources as input data. The BLEU score comparison revealed that Davinci-003 achieved a higher score of 0.035, while Davinci attained a score of 0.021. Additionally, for the response times, with Davinci demonstrating an average response time of 4.20 seconds, while Davinci-003 exhibited a slightly longer average response time of 6.59 seconds. The decision of whether to use Davinci-003 or Davinci for chatbot development should be made based on the specific project requirements. If prioritizing text quality is paramount, Davinci-003 emerges as the superior choice due to its higher BLEU score. However, if faster response times are of greater importance, Davinci may be the more suitable option. Ultimately, the selection should align with the unique needs and objectives of the chatbot development project.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe study aimed to evaluate the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 with two temperature parameter values, on the Polish Medical Final Examination (MFE). The models were tested on three editions of the MFE from: Spring 2022, Autumn 2022, and Spring 2023 in two language versions—English and Polish. The accuracies of both models were compared and the relationships between the correctness of answers with the answer’s metrics were investigated. The study demonstrated that GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in all three examinations regardless of the language used. GPT-4 achieved mean accuracies of 79.7% for both Polish and English versions, passing all MFE versions. GPT-3.5 had mean accuracies of 54.8% for Polish and 60.3% for English, passing none and 2 of 3 Polish versions for temperature parameter equal to 0 and 1 respectively while passing all English versions regardless of the temperature parameter value. GPT-4 score was mostly lower than the average score of a medical student. There was a statistically significant correlation between the correctness of the answers and the index of difficulty for both models. The overall accuracy of both models was still suboptimal and worse than the average for medical students. This emphasizes the need for further improvements in LLMs before they can be reliably deployed in medical settings. These findings suggest an increasing potential for the usage of LLMs in terms of medical education.",

        "abstract": " Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model in applying Fleischner Society recommendations to lung nodules. Methods: We generated 10 lung nodule descriptions for each of the 12 nodule categories from the Fleischner Society guidelines, incorporating them into a single fictitious report (n = 120). GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were prompted to make follow-up recommendations based on the reports. We then incorporated the full guidelines into the prompts and re-submitted them. Finally, we re-submitted the prompts to a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model. Results were analyzed using binary accuracy analysis in R. Results: GPT-3.5 accuracy in applying Fleischner Society guidelines was 0.058 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.12). GPT-4 accuracy was improved at 0.15 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.23; P = .02 for accuracy comparison). In recommending PET-CT and/or biopsy, both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had an F-score of 0.00. After explicitly including the Fleischner Society guidelines in the prompt, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 significantly improved their accuracy to 0.42 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.51; P < .001) and to 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.74; P < .001), respectively. GPT-4 remained significantly better than GPT-3.5 ( P < .001). The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model accuracy was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.55), not different from the GPT-3.5 model with guidelines included ( P = .53). Conclusion: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 performed poorly in applying widely known guidelines and never correctly recommended biopsy. Flawed knowledge and reasoning both contributed to their poor performance. While GPT-4 was more accurate than GPT-3.5, its inaccuracy rate was unacceptable for clinical practice. These results underscore the limitations of large language models for knowledge and reasoning-based tasks. ",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nThe potential of artificial intelligence (AI)–based large language models, such as ChatGPT, has gained significant attention in the medical field. This enthusiasm is driven not only by recent breakthroughs and improved accessibility, but also by the prospect of democratizing medical knowledge and promoting equitable health care. However, the performance of ChatGPT is substantially influenced by the input language, and given the growing public trust in this AI tool compared to that in traditional sources of information, investigating its medical accuracy across different languages is of particular importance.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to compare the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with that of medical students on the written German medical licensing examination.\n\n\nMethods\nTo assess GPT-3.5’s and GPT-4's medical proficiency, we used 937 original multiple-choice questions from 3 written German medical licensing examinations in October 2021, April 2022, and October 2022.\n\n\nResults\nGPT-4 achieved an average score of 85% and ranked in the 92.8th, 99.5th, and 92.6th percentiles among medical students who took the same examinations in October 2021, April 2022, and October 2022, respectively. This represents a substantial improvement of 27% compared to GPT-3.5, which only passed 1 out of the 3 examinations. While GPT-3.5 performed well in psychiatry questions, GPT-4 exhibited strengths in internal medicine and surgery but showed weakness in academic research.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe study results highlight ChatGPT’s remarkable improvement from moderate (GPT-3.5) to high competency (GPT-4) in answering medical licensing examination questions in German. While GPT-4’s predecessor (GPT-3.5) was imprecise and inconsistent, it demonstrates considerable potential to improve medical education and patient care, provided that medically trained users critically evaluate its results. As the replacement of search engines by AI tools seems possible in the future, further studies with nonprofessional questions are needed to assess the safety and accuracy of ChatGPT for the general population.\n",

AutoGPT experiences of users can be characterized by learning programs, autonomous applications, conducting research, and writing reports. The results of this study showed that content creation is the most important purpose of using Auto-GPT. As independent research functions of Auto-GPT, users also emphasize data summarization and information organization. However, the participants also pointed out the token limit (inefficiency), forgetting generated tools, and iteration as some prominent limitations of Auto-GPT.

However, the availability of high-quality Chinese medical knowledge remains limited, posing challenges for constructing Chinese medical knowledge graphs. As LLMs like ChatGPT show promise in zero-shot learning for many NLP downstream tasks, their potential on constructing Chinese medical knowledge graphs is still uncertain. In this study, we create a Chinese medical knowledge graph by manually annotating textual data and using ChatGPT to automatically generate the graph. We refine the results using filtering and mapping rules to align with our schema. The manually generated graph serves as the ground truth for evaluation, and we explore different methods to enhance its accuracy through knowledge graph completion techniques. As a result, we emphasize the potential of employing ChatGPT for automated knowledge graph construction within the Chinese medical domain. While ChatGPT successfully identifies a larger number of entities, further enhancements are required to improve its performance in extracting more qualified relations.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly developing technology that allows machines to process large amounts of data and make predictions. OpenAI's GPT-3 AI is one such example, which has been trained on data available up until June 2021, and had no access to more recent data nor was connected to the internet. The objective of this exploratory study was to investigate the potential of AI in forecasting the escalation of the 2022 Ukrainian war and to determine whether such contribution justifies co-authorship. In a stage-gate methodology, GPT-3's capability for generating future scenarios with estimated probabilities was used to check their consistency and define drivers for evaluating their presence before deciding on AI co-authorship in this publication. The results showed that GPT-3 accurately described the open war as one of the scenarios; however, its capability for predicting the future was limited, and internal consistency of generated scenarios could be improved. Overall, this study demonstrated that GPT-3 has proved itself as powerful for generating future scenarios and re-writing abstracts, like this one. According to our stage-gate approach, GPT-3 did not qualify for co-authorship in this publication.

Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine. The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain. There are various risk factors for the development of peptic ulcer disease, but the most important ones are Helicobacter pylori infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients generally present with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer bleeding. Acid suppressant therapy, H. pylori eradication, and avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the cornerstones of treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer bleeding could be life-threatening. It is managed by appropriate supportive care, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy, and endoscopic homeostasis. Trans arterial embolization (TAE), Herbal treated and surgery are rarely required if endoscopic therapy fails.",

        "abstract": "This study explores the potential benefits of employing generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) in recreational tourism, the difficulties that arise when implementing such technology, the impact it has on tourist behaviour, and the ways it can be utilised in recreational tourism management. The original aspect of the study is that it is the first to give detailed information about the use of GPT in recreational tourism. ChatGPT was used as an interviewer in the study. ChatGPT is a software application that utilizes the high-powered machine learning software called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3), developed by the OpenAI organization. Six questions were posed on the ChatGPT query screen (https://chat.openai.com/chat). The interview queries were prepared with reference to the study by Fusté-Forné and Orea-Giner (2023). The question statements in this study on the use of GPT in gastronomy tourism were changed to recreational tourism. ChatGPT's replies were tabulated and presented descriptively. Inferences and suggestions were made in line with the answers given by ChatGPT. The study showed that using GPT technology in recreational-based tourism can offer better customer interaction, decision-making, and a personalized travel experience. ChatGPT underlined that new technologies continue to evolve, and recreational-based tourism will become more personalized, informative, and immersive, ultimately enhancing the overall travel experience, and contributing to the growth and sustainability of the tourism industry. ChatGPT also noted GPT models have the potential to shape and enhance the entire travel experience for tourists, from the initial planning stages to the actual trip itself. Although GPT makes significant contributions to recreational tourism management and recreational tourists, there are deficiencies in ethical, privacy, and authenticity concerns.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India.\n\n\nObjective\nThis comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions.\n\n\nMethods\nIn this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models.\n\n\nResults\nIt was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.\n",

In June 2023, text-based multiple-choice questions were submitted to GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5. The AAO provides the percentage of humans who selected the correct answer, which was analyzed for comparison. All questions were classified by 10 subspecialties and 3 practice areas (diagnostics/clinics, medical treatment, surgery). Out of 1023 questions, GPT-4.0 achieved the best score (82.4%), followed by humans (75.7%) and GPT-3.5 (65.9%), with significant difference in accuracy rates (always P < 0.0001). Both GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 showed the worst results in surgery-related questions (74.6% and 57.0% respectively). For difficult questions (answered incorrectly by > 50% of humans), both GPT models favorably compared to humans, without reaching significancy. The word count for answers provided by GPT-4.0 was significantly lower than those produced by GPT-3.5 (160 ± 56 and 206 ± 77 respectively, P < 0.0001); however, incorrect responses were longer (P < 0.02). GPT-4.0 represented a substantial improvement over GPT-3.5, achieving better performance than humans in an AAO BCSC self-assessment test. However, ChatGPT is still limited by inconsistency across different practice areas, especially when it comes to surgery.",

Research methods include the social experiment method, when Chat GPT was asked certain questions of a legal nature, answers to them were received and analyzed. Also during the study, general scientific research methods were used, such as analysis, synthesis, deduction, abstraction, generalization. These research methods were used to reveal the features and patterns of legal activity, the features and patterns of the functioning of artificial intelligence systems, as well as to draw conclusions about the degree of applicability of artificial intelligence technologies for solving a particular class of problems in jurisprudence.\r\nDuring the study, it was found that artificial intelligence technologies based on Chat GPT in some cases are not very suitable for solving problems related to the application of legal norms to specific situations, due to the specific “thinking” of artificial intelligence systems, which in some cases does not allow one to distinguish so-called legal circumstances that are significant in a given situation, from legal circumstances that are not significant in a given situation, the inability in some cases to correctly qualify the legal relations of the parties and make the correct legal decision with reference to current legislation. The study also analyzed the capabilities of artificial intelligence based on Chat GPT technologies for solving problems in the field of lawmaking, application and interpretation of legal norms. It is concluded that in these areas, artificial intelligence technologies, including those based on Chat GPT, have a certain potential, provided that the associative connection built by artificial intelligence between the elements of legal reality contained in the texts corresponds to the ontological connection between the objects of legal reality.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: This paper presents the results of an analysis of a dialogue between a human and a chatbot on rhetorical topics. The problematic has a topicality that is new in the study of an understudied field, namely the communication in a mini-virtual community between a human and GhatGTP. The first focus is on analyzing linguistic and rhetorical features of answering questions posed by the researcher, who is also a participant in the dialogue. The second focus is on the ways in which the results of the search for rhetoric-related information are presented and structured by the chatbot. The third focus is on the ways in which the chatbot identifies itself using algorithms and pre-prepared information by experts from different fields and how it verbalizes and self-assesses it. The first hypothesis is that from a linguistic point of view the chatbot uses terms; does not allow figurative language, realizes an informative function; structures short texts of good logical consistency, which are dominated by the statement of previously presented information. The second hypothesis is related to rhetorical themes and canons and it is that the chatbot successfully realizes two rhetorical canons (invention and composition) searching for information from accessible online sources, selects and structures facts into popular level. The paper tests a research approach, conventionally called auto-cyberethnographic monitoring, which combines the cyberethnographic method with autoethnography. The text does not aim at providing exhaustive information, it is oriented towards establishing the possibilities of delineating a new scientific field of research that presupposes an interdisciplinary approach and modern research methods. Keywords: rhetoric, rhetorical canons, language, dialogue, Chatbot GPT, cyberethnographic method, autoethnography, auto-cyberethnographic monitoring.

        "abstract": "Mobile technologies have become increasingly important in the field of education, providing innovative ways to engage students and enrich their learning experiences. ChatGPT is an innovative tool that can be used in English for Specific Purposes (ESP) classes to engage students, enhance their knowledge and skills, and add variety and interest to the traditional process of learning engineering English, whether accessed through computers or mobile devices. In light of this, the study aims to investigate and compare the attitudes of technical university students and teachers towards using ChatGPT in English classes, as well as their perspectives on academic integrity issues and the strategies they employ when using ChatGPT. The study involved 22 teachers and 60 students from a Ukrainian university. Quantitative research, which involved collecting data through surveys, showed that students exhibited positive attitudes, while teachers took a more neutral approach. Both groups agree that ChatGPT plays a supplementary role in enhancing both hard and soft skills, as well as English language communication skills. However, they emphasized its impact on the development of research skills. The study highlights critical issues related to academic integrity, specifically the differing perceptions of possible violations between students and teachers. The authors present ideas on integrating ChatGPT into ESP classes, enabling teachers to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools for language learning and adapt to changing educational landscapes. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating ChatGPT effectively into engineering English classes to support students’ learning. While emphasizing the importance of guidelines for academic integrity, it also advocates for the creative use of AI tools by teachers and students. Addressing the disparity in attitudes suggests providing teacher professional development to ensure proficient use of AI tools.",

        "abstract": "Summary\n\nObjectives\nThe rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted an exploration of their efficacy in generating PICO-based (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) queries, especially in the field of orthodontics. This study aimed to assess the usability of Large Language Models (LLMs), in aiding systematic review processes, with a specific focus on comparing the performance of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4 using a specialized prompt tailored for orthodontics.\n\n\nMaterials/Methods\nFive databases were perused to curate a sample of 77 systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2016 and 2021. Utilizing prompt engineering techniques, the LLMs were directed to formulate PICO questions, Boolean queries, and relevant keywords. The outputs were subsequently evaluated for accuracy and consistency by independent researchers using three-point and six-point Likert scales. Furthermore, the PICO records of 41 studies, which were compatible with the PROSPERO records, were compared with the responses provided by the models.\n\n\nResults\nChatGPT 3.5 and 4 showcased a consistent ability to craft PICO-based queries. Statistically significant differences in accuracy were observed in specific categories, with GPT-4 often outperforming GPT-3.5.\n\n\nLimitations\nThe study’s test set might not encapsulate the full range of LLM application scenarios. Emphasis on specific question types may also not reflect the complete capabilities of the models.\n\n\nConclusions/Implications\nBoth ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 can be pivotal tools for generating PICO-driven queries in orthodontics when optimally configured. However, the precision required in medical research necessitates a judicious and critical evaluation of LLM-generated outputs, advocating for a circumspect integration into scientific investigations.\n",

Considering such concerns, this small study, which employs both qualitative and quantitative methods, thoroughly examines the role of language models, particularly ChatGPT, in the context of academic integrity. By assessing the accuracy of test answers generated by said language model, on questions from the state-issued high-school graduation English exam in N. Macedonia, and analyzing parts of essays generated using various prompts, the study aims to explore the potential implications of such AI tools on academic integrity in this new tech era.\nThe study shows that ChatGPT's accuracy in providing test answers is satisfactory, with a minimal number of mistakes and over 80% accuracy on average, on both tests! As for the text/parts of essays generated by the model, the study has shown that the quality of the generated text differed based on the prompts that the user provided and their proficiency in articulating their specific demands. The study also showed that current AI detection remains unreliable at best.\nThese findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI's influence on education and academic integrity, especially in regard to ChatGPT’s capabilities to generate content that can pass standardized tests and excel in open-ended writing tasks.",

In terms of the number of documents per year, 2 were found in 2019, 10 in 2020, 22 in 2021, 44 in 2022, and 144 in 2023. The year-on-year growth rate was over 100% in all years. The subject area with the highest number of documents was Computer Science with 90 documents. The most productive countries in relation to GPT were the United States with 60 documents, followed by China with 19, the United Kingdom with 18, India with 15, and Australia with 12. Co-occurrence illustrated the centrality of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and the term Human around ChatGPT and GPT.\nConclusions: this bibliometric study aimed to describe the knowledge networks of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) as an emerging technology. Although only 222 documents were found, this study revealed a high level of international scientific collaboration in the field. The results suggest that GPT is a highly relevant technology with a wide range of potential applications in natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning.\nMoreover, the study was able to qualitatively characterize the main thematic areas surrounding GPT, including its applications in chatbots, text generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more.",

        "abstract": "La atribución de significado a los segmentos de información propia del análisis de textos abiertos en investigación cualitativa implica una considerable inversión de tiempo. Las herramientas de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural pueden convertirse en un recurso para el investigador cualitativo, en cuanto que sus algoritmos permiten interpretar los textos y codificar cualitativamente de forma mucho más rápida. Esta tarea, sin embargo, requiere probar previamente el nivel de comprensión verbal de estas herramientas. La aparición del modelo GPT-3 de OpenAI supuso un salto cualitativo respecto a modelos de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural anteriores. El objetivo fue analizar la capacidad de comprensión verbal de esta herramienta. Se aplicaron las pruebas del índice de comprensión verbal de la batería para la medición del cociente intelectual WAIS-IV. Los resultados de las pruebas de fiabilidad fueron satisfactorios. Respecto al nivel de comprensión verbal, las respuestas situaron a GPT-3 en un percentil superior al 99, comparado con los estándares humanos. Estos resultados demuestran que es posible utilizar este modelo como herramienta para el análisis de textos abiertos, abriendo enormes posibilidades para la investigación cualitativa, aunque su uso debe basarse en una utilización precisa y diseñada ad hoc para cada proceso de análisis.",

In this study, sentiment analysis is used to understand people’s enthusiasm toward Chat GPT. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the acceptance of people of new artificial intelligence technology, Chat GPT, that may change the future. To get a deep understanding of it, a large dataset of user comments from YouTube is collected and then data pre-processing is done by removing stop words, punctuations, and irrelevant information. Using Text Blob and VADER approaches, comments are classified into positive, neutral, and negative categories. The result shows that most users have a positive sentiment to receive and use Chat GPT. The contribution of this study is to provide insights into the sentiment of people’s response to Chat GPT, which can inform user acceptance of the language model development and give guide its future applications.</p>",

GPT-3 war nach seiner Veröffentlichung das leistungsstärkste Modell seiner Zeit.  Das Programm generiert Texte, die oft nicht von menschlich verfassten Inhalten zu unterscheiden sind. GPT-3s Größe und Komplexität ermöglichen es, dass es wissenschaftliche Artikel eigenständig schreiben und ausgeben kann, die laut Studien und Untersuchungen zum Bestehen von Universitätskursen ausreichen. Mit der Entwicklung solcher Künstlichen Intelligenzen, insbesondere auf Open Source-Basis, könnten Studierende in Zukunft studentische Hausarbeiten von Textgeneratoren schreiben lassen. Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich einerseits mit dem Modell GPT-3 und seinen Fähigkeiten sowie Risiken. Andererseits wird die Frage thematisiert, wie Hochschulen und Universitäten in Zukunft mit maschinell verfassten Arbeiten umgehen können.",

        "abstract": "Financial analysis is an important tool for evaluating company performance. Practitioners work to answer financial questions to make profitable investment decisions, and use advanced quantitative analyses to do so. As a result, Financial Question Answering (QA) is a question answering task that requires deep reasoning about numbers. Furthermore, it is unknown how well pre-trained language models can reason in the financial domain. The current state-of-the-art requires a retriever to collect relevant facts about the financial question from the text and a generator to produce a valid financial program and a final answer. However, recently large language models like GPT-3 [1] have achieved state-of-the-art performance on wide variety of tasks with just a few shot examples. We run several experiments with GPT-3 and find that a separate retrieval model and logic engine continue to be essential components to achieving SOTA performance in this task, particularly due to the precise nature of financial questions and the complex information stored in financial documents. With this understanding, our refined promptengineering approach on GPT-3 achieves near SOTA accuracy without any fine-tuning.",

Após estímulo, observou-se sua adesão, porém com dúvidas sobre veracidade de dados recebidos e frustrações por falta de soluções definitivas rapidamente. Por fim, detectou-se falta de criticidade sobre riscos éticos e discriminatórios da plataforma, mas também encantamento e desejo de dominá-la, após compreenderem a lógica de consultas e comandos dessa tecnologia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPurpose\nThis study explores the utility of the large language models, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for in-depth patient education prior to interventional radiology procedures. Further, differences in answer accuracy between the models were assessed.\n\nMaterials and methods\nA total of 133 questions related to three specific interventional radiology procedures (Port implantation, PTA and TACE) covering general information as well as preparation details, risks and complications and post procedural aftercare were compiled. Responses of GPT-3 and GPT-4 were assessed for their accuracy by two board-certified radiologists using a 5-point Likert scale. The performance difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4 was analyzed.\n\nResults\nBoth GPT-3 and GPT-4 responded with (5) “completely correct” (4) “very good” answers for the majority of questions ((5) 30.8% + (4) 48.1% for GPT-3 and (5) 35.3% + (4) 47.4% for GPT-4). GPT-3 and GPT-4 provided (3) “acceptable” responses 15.8% and 15.0% of the time, respectively. GPT-3 provided (2) “mostly incorrect” responses in 5.3% of instances, while GPT-4 had a lower rate of such occurrences, at just 2.3%. No response was identified as potentially harmful. GPT-4 was found to give significantly more accurate responses than GPT-3 (p = 0.043).\n\nConclusion\nGPT-3 and GPT-4 emerge as relatively safe and accurate tools for patient education in interventional radiology. GPT-4 showed a slightly better performance. The feasibility and accuracy of these models suggest their promising role in revolutionizing patient care. Still, users need to be aware of possible limitations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n",

Lan-guage models, including Chat GPT, are mainly used for working with such monotonous tasks as checking homework, writing and assessment tasks. The implementation of AI has certain advantages (finding individual approach, fast and detailed feedback, etc.) and disadvantages (overdependence on the technology, academic cheating, etc.). This article examines the use of the above language system for generating English grammar exercises in order to introduce them into the educational process when working with primary school students in comparison with the use of similar material from traditional grammar books. The study revealed the absence of significant differences between exercises from grammar books and those created by the artificial intelligence.",
