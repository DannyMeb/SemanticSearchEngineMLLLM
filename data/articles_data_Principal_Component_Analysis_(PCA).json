        "abstract": "In the 40s of the last century, Karhunen and Lo√®ve proposed a method for processing of one-dimensional numeric time series by converting it into a multidimensional by shifts. In fact, a one-dimensional number series was decomposed into several orthogonal time series. This method has many times been independently developed and applied in practice under various names (EOF, SSA, Caterpillar, etc.). Nowadays, the name SSA (the Singular Spectral Analysis) is most often used. It turned out that it is universal, applicable to any time series without requiring stationary assumptions, automatically decomposes time series into a trend, cyclic components and noise. By the beginning of the 1980s Takens showed that for a dynamical system such a method makes it possible to obtain an attractor from observing only one of these variables, thereby bringing the method to a powerful theoretical basis. In the same years, the practical benefits of phase portraits became clear. In particular, it was used in the analysis and forecast of the animal abundance dynamics.In this paper we propose to extend SSA to one-dimensional sequence of any type elements, including numbers, symbols, figures, etc., and, as a special case, to molecular sequence. Technically, the problem is solved almost the same algorithm as the SSA. The sequence is cut by a sliding window into fragments of a given length. Between all fragments, the matrix of Euclidean distances is calculated. This is always possible. For example, the square root from the Hamming distance between fragments is the Euclidean distance. For the resulting matrix, the principal components are calculated by the principal-coordinate method (PCo). Instead of a distance matrix one can use a matrix of any similarity/dissimilarity indexes and apply methods of multidimensional scaling (MDS). The result will always be PCs in some Euclidean space.We called this method PCA-Seq. It is certainly an exploratory method, as its particular case SSA. For any sequence, including molecular, PCA-Seq without any additional assumptions allows to get its principal components in a numerical form and visualize them in the form of phase portraits. Long-term experience of SSA application for numerical data gives all reasons to believe that PCA-Seq will be not less useful in the analysis of non-numerical data, especially in hypothesizing.PCA-Seq is implemented in the freely distributed Jacobi 4 package (http://mrherrn.github.io/JACOBI4/).",

Until now, phylogenetic analysis methods have been used for this purpose. Here we show that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is widely used in population genetics, can not only help us to understand existing findings about the mutation processes of the virus, but can also provide even deeper insights into these processes while being less sensitive to sequencing gaps. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of a 46,046 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence dataset downloaded from the GISAID database in June of this year.SummaryPCA provides deep insights into the analysis of large data sets of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, revealing virus lineages that have thus far been unnoticed.",

        "abstract": "This research represents a conceptual shift in the process of introducing flexibility into power system frequency stability-related protection. The existing underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) solution, although robust and fast, has often proved to be incapable of adjusting to different operating conditions. It triggers upon detection of frequency threshold violations, and functions by interrupting the electricity supply to a certain number of consumers, both of which values are decided upon beforehand. Consequently, it often does not comply with its main purpose, i.e., bringing frequency decay to a halt. Instead, the power imbalance is often reversed, resulting in equally undesirable frequency overshoots. Researchers have sought a solution to this shortcoming either by increasing the amount of available information (by means of wide-area communication) or through complex changes to all involved protection relays. In this research, we retain the existing concept of UFLS that performs so well for fast-occurring frequency events. The flexible rebalancing of power is achieved by a small and specialized group of intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) with machine learning functionalities. These IEDs interrupt consumers only when the need to do so is detected with a high degree of certainty. Their small number assures the fine-tuning of power rebalancing and, at the same time, poses no serious threat to system stability in cases of malfunction.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that allows reduction of the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance and visualizing the information on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics), implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK. PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We employed an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data for eleven common test cases. We demonstrate that PCA results are artifacts of the data and that they can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the literature of population genetics and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Principal component analysis is a recognized powerful and practical method in statistics and data science. It can also be used in modeling as a dimensionality reduction tool to achieve low-order models of complex multiphysics or engineering systems. Model-order reduction (MOR) methodologies today are an important topic for engineering design and analysis. Design space exploration or accelerated numerical optimization for example are made easier by the use of reduced-order models. In this chapter, we will talk about the use of higher-order singular value decompositions (HOSVD) applied to spatiotemporal problems that are parameterized by a set of design variables or physical parameters. Here we consider a data-driven reduced order modeling based on a design of computer experiment: from high-dimensional computational results returned by high-fidelity solvers (e.g. finite element ones), the HOSVD allows us to determine spatial, time and parameters principal components. The dynamics of the system can then be retrieved by identifying the low-order discrete dynamical system. As application, we will consider the dynamics of deformable capsules flowing into microchannels. The study of such fluid-structure interaction problems is motivated by the use of microcapsules as innovative drug delivery carriers through blood vessels.",

        "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely used in metabolomics. However, it is not always possible to detect phenotype-associated principal component (PC) scores. Previously, we proposed a smoothed PCA for samples acquired with a time course or rank order, but hypothesis testing to select significant metabolite candidates was not possible. Here, we modified the smoothed PCA as an orthogonal smoothed PCA (OS-PCA) so that statistical hypothesis testing in OS-PC loadings could be performed with the same PC projections provided by the smoothed PCA. Statistical hypothesis testing is especially useful in metabolomics because biological interpretations are made based on statistically significant metabolites. We applied the OS-PCA method to two real metabolome datasets, one for metabolic turnover analysis and the other for evaluating the taste of Japanese green tea. The OS-PCA successfully extracted similar PC scores as the smoothed PCA; these scores reflected the expected phenotypes. The significant metabolites that were selected using statistical hypothesis testing of OS-PC loading facilitated biological interpretations that were consistent with the results of our previous study. Our results suggest that OS-PCA combined with statistical hypothesis testing of OS-PC loading is a useful method for the analysis of metabolome data.",

        "abstract": "Soil health indicators are related to environmental factors, such as nutrient management, crop practices, different cropping systems, and biodiversity. 14 soil health indicators were measured and compared in our study to clarify the impact of different cropping system on soil quality. The primary comparisons were carried out among perennial plants, annual plants, and cover cropping, with an examination of the tillage system and fertilization taken into account during the analysis. Multivariant analysis recorded that the most promising indicators of soil health that related to soil quality and health were organic carbon (OC), total carbon (TC), followed by fall soil total nitrogen (TN). The main factor for clustering treatments based on indicators was N fertilization according to Euclidean distance that was applied to measure similarity of the groups. Although perennials and cover crops recorded more carbon sequestration and TC improvement, corn crops showed the worse impact on soil pH and bulk density (BD). Non-tillage practices significantly increased wet aggregate and soil moisture. The combination of TC field measurements with long-term cropping systems information has improved our understanding of how different cropping practices influence SOC improvement in soil full profile. It would develop appropriate and cost-effective agricultural management activities, maintain or improve carbon soil accumulation to guide farmer decision making, and ultimately advance food and nutritional security.",

It is a critical step carried out as part of the Virtual Machine (VM) placement to allocate the best Physical Machine (PM) to host the VMs. The efficacy of the virtual machine placement strategy has a considerable impact on cloud computing efficiency. The ineffec-tiveness of the VMP approach has a major negative impact on the CDC.Virtualization facilitated VM migration has met the ever-increasing demands of dynamic workload by transferring VMs inside CDC. Many resource management goals, including power efficiency, load balancing, fault tolerance, and system maintenance, are aided VM placement. As a result, VMP needs to assess characteristics that may impact placement performance and energy efficiency. Most past research has concentrated solely on reducing energy consumption while ignoring SLA (service level agreement) breaches, enhancing the resource usage of PMs, and ignoring the over-commitment issue. MOM-VMP To propose a multiobjective Mayfly VMP algorithm (MOM-VMP) meta-heuristic optimization algorithm with a massive CDC with different and multi-dimensional resources to handle these issues. A multi-objective dynamic VMP strategy is employed to reduce resource wastage, overcom-mitment ratio, migration time, SLA violation and energy consumption at the same time. This paper presents a dynamic multi-objective VMP in CDC based on overcommitment resource allocation to influence VM-PM mapping. We validated our method of conducting a performance evaluation study using the CloudSim tool. The experimental findings show that the suggested study decreases energy consumption, makespan, SLA violations, and PM overloading while enhancing resource utilization.",

        "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various domains due to their outstanding performance. However, they simultaneously bring enormous computational overhead, making it difficult to deploy to mobile and edge devices. Therefore, researchers use network compression techniques such as quantization, knowledge distillation and neural network pruning to alleviate this problem. Among network pruning, filter pruning has received broad attention. At present, most of the filter pruning methods need to define pruning rates manually, which is a trial-and-error process and requires rich experimental experience. Some methods obtain global optimal network parameters by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) or Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to overcome this difficulty. However, they also introduce huge computational burden. To mitigate the above problems, this study proposes a pruning strategy based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) called PCA-Pruner. Filter weights of a layer is regarded as a set of features, and the number of filters responding to feature dimension. Then, the number of reserved filters in each layer can be determined by PCA which is a classical dimensionality reduction technology. After that, we calculate the L1 norm of each filter in each layer and use it as an importance measurement to prune filters. Experimental results show that PCA-Pruner achieve performance improvements over the state-of-the-arts algorithms. For example, we compress the FLOPs and parameters of ResNet-56 on CIFA-10 by 45.8% and 47.1%, with an increase in accuracy of 0.27%. For ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10, we improve the accuracy by 0.58% and reduce the FLOPs and Params of the model by 58.3% and 56.2%, respectively. Towards ResNet-56 on CIFAR-100 dataset, we achieve a 38.8% FLOPs decrease and 38.0% Params reduction with only 0.69% accuracy loss.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic nature of movement and muscle activation emphasizes the importance of a sound experimental design. To ensure that an experiment determines what we intend, the design must be carefully evaluated. Before analyzing data, it is imperative to limit the number of outliers, biases, and skewness. In the present study, a simple center-out experiment was performed by 16 healthy volunteers. The experiment included three load conditions, two preparatory delays, two perturbations, and four targets placed along a diagonal path on a 2D plane. While the participants performed the tasks, the activity of seven arm muscles were monitored using surface electromyography (EMG). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the study design, identify muscle synergies, and assess the effects of individual quirks. With PCA, we can identify the trials that trigger stretch reflexes and pinpoint muscle synergies. The posterior deltoid, triceps long head, and brachioradialis were engaged when targets were in the direction of muscle shortening and the perturbation was applied in the opposite direction. Similarly, the pectoralis and anterior deltoid were engaged when the targets were in the direction of muscle shortening and the perturbation was applied in the opposite direction. The stretch reflexes were not triggered when the perturbation brought the hand in the direction of, or into the target, except if the muscle was pre-loaded. The use of PCA was also proven valuable when evaluating participant performance. While individual quirks are to be expected, failure to perform trials as expected can adversely affect the study results.",

        "abstract": "What social progress is and how to measure it are seemingly plain but essentially intri-cate questions that have not been clarified to date, which has led to various social problems and development failures. Designed after the Great Depression in the 1930s, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been, on the one hand, regarded as the greatest invention of the 20th century and is widely accepted as the primary indicator for social progress, but on the other hand, it has been criticized as knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing. The Beyond GDP Movement that has been active since the 2010s has inspired global interest in designing indicators to replace or supplement GDP, but none of them stands out as GDP‚Äôs successor. We take 12 influential indicators that consider beyond GDP and carry out a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to investigate their correlations. The results indicate that GDP per capita (GDPP) can explain 65.61% of the information in the first principal component (PC) and account for 51.10% of the information related to the total 13 indicators, indicating its major role in social progress. Most indicators have strong correlations with GDPP, not beyond, and only the Ecological Footprint per capita (EFP) and Happy Planet Index (HPI) that have negative and weak correlations with GDPP, respectively, can provide new perspectives and values beyond GDP. Social progress is based upon various public values, and the indicators are the measurements of these values. Although GDP and economic values play major roles during social development, other indicators and their potential public values cannot be ignored. Prioritizing these public values and monitoring their indicators are essential to achieving sustainable and comprehensive social progress.",

The information content of the PCA output consists of certain functions of Bragg angles (loadings) and their evolution characteristics that depend on external variables like pressure or temperature (scores). The physical meaning of the PCA output is to date not well understood. Therefore, in this paper, the intensity contributions are first derived analytically, then compared with the PCA components for model data; finally PCA is applied for the real data on isothermal gas uptake by nanoporous framework    Œ≥   ‚ÄìMg(BH     4    )     2    . We show that, in close agreement with previous analysis of modulation diffraction, the variation of intensity of Bragg lines and the displacements of their positions results in a series of PCA components. Every PCA extracted component may be a mixture of terms carrying information on the average structure, active sub-structure, and their cross-term. The rotational ambiguities, that are an inherently part of PCA extraction, are at the origin of the mixing. For the experimental case considered in the paper, the extraction of the physically meaningful loadings and scores can only be achieved with a rotational correction. Finally, practical recommendations for non-blind applications, i.e., what boundary conditions to apply for the the rotational correction, of PCA for diffraction data are given.",

        "abstract": "The human face is an entity that has semantic features. Face detection is the first step before face recognition. Face recognition technique is an identification process based on facial features. One feature extraction approach for facial recognition techniques is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The PCA method is used to simplify facial features and characteristics in order to obtain proportions that are able to represent the characteristics of the original face. The purpose of this research is to construct facial patterns stored in a digital image database. The process of pattern construction and face recognition starts from objects in the form of face images, side detection, pattern construction until it can determine the similarity of face patterns to proceed as face recognition. In this research, a program has been designed to test some samples of face data stored in a digital image database so that it can provide a similarity in the face patterns being observed and its introduction using PCA",

        "abstract": "This study aims at presenting an approach capable of improving the efficiency measurement index using the Principal Component Analysis. The main reason for the adoption of this approach in measurement process lies in the fact that during an analysis of data envelopment, there is often discrimination problems among measurement units, whether a measurement unit is efficient or not, especially there is a large number of variables (inputs and outputs). As to the size of a sample to be studied, and for addressing this problem, the Principal Component Analysis is adopted in this study, which is deemed one of the important statistical tools in decreasing original variable dimensions. For obtaining new variables representing principal components, factors for each variable have been identified, which works on determining its effect. Therefore, this study brings to light an integrated approach between two procedures: PCA-DEA, taking part in enhancing results of the efficiency measurement index. This approach has been applied to a problem related to the state financial management of the Iraqi Budget for the years (2005 ‚Äì 2019). As per the decrease principal accomplished through the use of PCA, efficient years are identified.",

This study was conducted in Cimahi City, West Java Province, Indonesia. The population and sample of this study were all the potentials of the region and the industrial fields in the City of Cimahi, West Java and the fields/programs/competencies of SMKs in the City of Cimahi. Data in this study were collected using documentation, interview and observation methods. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used as the method of analyzing regional potentials using Minitab Statistical Software version 14. Based on the results of this study it was found that the development of Vocational High Schools is based on regional potential in Cimahi City and based on the analysis of Vocational Development Levels in Cimahi City by using the PCA analysis method based on indicators education such as Total Population Ages 16-18, Student Ratio per School, Student Ratio per Class, Student Ratio per Teacher, and Gross Participation Rate (GPR) in 3 (three) Districts of Cimahi City found that the lowest PCA 1 for the three districts is in South Cimahi District (-1026.02). This means that the priority location I for the development of SMK is South Cimahi District. It is then followed by Central Cimahi Subdistrict (-644.19) which becomes priority location II for the development of SMK. And Priority III is the District of North Cimahi (-435.5). With these findings, the Office of Education, especially in the area of Vocational Secondary Education in the Cimahi City, West Java, should pay attention to the development of vocational schools which requires careful study in establishing vocational schools based on the potential of the region.",

These techniques give more accurate and correct detection in determining the variables suspected to contain gross error. These techniques are reliable to solve the problem of correlation present in measurement data. As one of multivariate statistical technique, PCA can be used to detect gross error in the measurement. The objectives of this research are to apply PCA for detection and identification of gross error in measurement data, to apply data reconciliation technique to obtain reconciled data, and to investigate application of PCA leading to its use in the dynamic data reconciliation. In this research, the operation of multistage compressor in urea fertilizer plant is chosen as the studied case. The results of this research prove that PCA can be applied for detection and identification of gross error in measurement data of mass flow, pressure, and temperature. PCA application on steady state data reconciliation can be usedfor detection the location of gross error in the measurement data. Gross error in the data can be eliminated and corrected exactly. Moreover, PCA can be used to detect and isolate fault quickly leading to its use in the dynamic data reconciliation. Nevertheless, process knowledge base must be collected first before the application of PCA. If the process knowledge is more complete, the confidence of the inference becomes higher.Keywords: Measurement Data, Gross Error, Data Reconciliation, PCA¬†AbstrakDalam perkembangannya, deteksi kesalahan nyata dilakukan dengan teknik statistik multi varia bel untuk mendapatkan hasil yang lebih akurat dan benar dalam penentuan varia bel yang menyebabkan kesalahan¬† nyata¬† tersebut.¬† Teknik¬† statistik¬† multivariabel¬† dikenal¬† handal¬† dalam¬† mengatasi permasalahan dimana terdapat korelasi diantara varia bel proses yang diukur.

        "abstract": "Face recognition is a biometric technique that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as national security, access control, identity fraud, banking, and finding missing children. Faces are highly dynamic and facial features are not always easily extracted, which can lead to discarding textural information like the smoothness of faces, a hairstyle that, might contain strong identity information. In addition, brightness, scale, and facial expressions play a significant role in the face-recognizing process. Therefore, face recognition is considered as a difficult problem. To figure out this problem effective methods using databases techniques are needed. This paper describes face recognition methods and their structure. Based on Wen Yi Zhao and Rama Chellappa work the face recognition methods are divided into three groups: a holistic approach, feature-based approach, and hybrid approach, where Principal Component Analysis PCA, a holistic approach method, is presented as a mathematical technique that can assist the process of face recognition. Also, the paper shows how the PCA is used to extract facial features by removing the principal components of the available multidimensional data.",

        "abstract": "Principal components analysis (PCA) is a popular dimension reduction method and is applied to analyze quantitative data. For PCA to qualitative data, nonlinear PCA can be applied, where the data are quantified by using optimal scaling that nonlinearly transforms qualitative data into quantitative data. Then nonlinear PCA reveals nonlinear relationships among variables with different measurement levels. Using this quantification, we can consider variable selection in the context of PCA for qualitative data. In PCA for quantitative data, modified PCA (M.PCA) of Tanaka and Mori derives principal components which are computed as a linear combination of a subset of variables but can reproduce all the variables very well. This means that M.PCA can select a reasonable subset of variables with different measurement levels if it is extended so as to deal with qualitative data by using the idea of nonlinear PCA. A nonlinear M.PCA is therefore proposed for variable selection in nonlinear PCA. The method, in this chapter, is based on the idea in ‚ÄúNonlinear Principal Component Analysis and its Applications‚Äù by Mori et al. (Springer). The performance of the method is evaluated in a numerical example.",

        "abstract": "Numerous methods exist aimed at examining patterns in structured and unstructured financial data. Applications of these methods include fraud detection, risk management, credit allocation, assessment of the risk of default, customer analytics, trading prediction, and many others, creating a broad field of research named Financial data science. A problem within the field that remains significantly under-researched, yet very important, is that of differentiating between the three major types of business activities‚Äîmerchandising, manufacturing, and service based on the structured data available in financial reports. It can be argued that, due to the inherent idiosyncrasies of the three types of business activities, methods for assessment of the risk of default, methods for credit allocation, and methods for fraud detection would all see an improved performance if reliable information on the percentage of entities‚Äô business activities allocated to the three major activities would be available. To this end, in this paper, we propose a clustering procedure that relies on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature selection. The procedure is presented using a large empirical data set comprising complete financial reports for various business entities operating in the Republic in Serbia, that pertain to the reporting period 2019.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to analyze geochemical and isotopic data and interpret the characteristics and types of mantle sources of Cenozoic volcanic activities around the South China Sea (SCS). Fifteen trace element indicators and five isotopic indicators were surveyed from 623 volcanic rock samples obtained from the SCS, Hainan Island, Fujian‚ÄìZhejiang, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand to characterize the geochemical properties of the volcanic rocks, determine the types of mantle sources, and assess the influence degree of each mantle source. Two principal components (PCs) were extracted by PCA based on trace elements and Sr‚ÄìNd‚ÄìPb isotopic ratios, which are an enriched oceanic island basalt-type mantle plume and a depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt-type spreading ridge. In the Southeast Asian region, the influence of Hainan mantle plume on younger volcanic activities (<‚Äâ13 Ma) was greater than that on older ones (>‚Äâ13 Ma) in the same location. PCA was used to verify the mantle plume‚Äìridge interaction model of volcanic activities beneath the expansion center of the SCS and refute the hypothesis that the tension in the SCS is triggered by the Hainan plume. The results of this study demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of PCA to the discussion of mantle sources of volcanic activities and provide a new method with which to analyze geochemical data.",

On March 11, 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic because in less than three months it had infected more than 120,000 people in 123 countries from Asia, Europe, United States, to South Africa. This rapid growth of cases is caused by many factors. Therefore, the author wants to examine social and economic factors in 29 countries regarding the COVID-19 case. In this study, the author uses 122 variables; consisting of 107 variables from social factors and 15 variables from economic factors. Because the number of variables used was quite large, the author reduced the data using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, 15 main components are formed from the results of the application of PCA carried out on 122 variables. It will then be used to form a regression equation for the COVID-19 case which consists of the average new cases of COVID-19 per day, the rate of infected population COVID-19, the percentage of deaths caused by COVID-19, and the percentile of the new cases of COVID-19 per day.",
