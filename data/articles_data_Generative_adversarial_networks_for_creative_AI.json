        "abstract": "The growth of generative adversarial network (GAN) models has increased the ability of image processing and provides numerous industries with the technology to produce realistic image transformations. However, with the field being recently established there are new evaluation metrics that can further this research. Previous research has shown the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to be an effective metric when testing these image-to-image GANs in real-world applications. Signed Inception Distance (SID), a founded metric in 2023, expands on FID by allowing unsigned distances. This paper usespublic datasetsthat consist of façades, cityscapes, and maps within Pix2Pix and CycleGAN models. After trainin , these models are evaluated on both inception distance metrics which measure the generating performance of the trained models. Our findings indicate that usage of the metric SID incorporates an efficient and effective metric to complement, or even exceed the ability shown using the FID for the image-to-image GANs.",

        "abstract": "<span lang=\"EN-US\">There are a wide range of potential uses for both the forward (generating face drawings from actual images) and backward (generating photos from synthetic face sketches). However, photo/sketch synthesis is still a difficult problem to solve because of the distinct differences between photos and sketches. Existing frameworks often struggle to acquire a strong mapping among the geometry of drawing and its corresponding photo-realistic pictures because of the little amount of paired sketch-photo training data available. In this study, we adopt the perspective that this is an image-to-image translation issue and investigate the usage of the well-known enhanced pix2pix generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate high-quality photo-realistic pictures from drawings; we make use of three distinct datasets. While recent GAN-based approaches have shown promise in image translation, they still struggle to produce high-resolution, photorealistic pictures. This technique uses supervised learning to train the generator's hidden layers to produce low-resolution pictures initially, then uses the network's implicit refinement to produce high-resolution images. Extensive tests on three sketch-photo datasets (two publicly accessible and one we produced) are used to evaluate. Our solution outperforms existing image translation techniques by producing more photorealistic visuals with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 59.85% and pixel accuracy of 82.7%. </span>",

To achieve the style migration of AI painting artworks, the Cycle GAN model was designed on this basis. Comparing the features of both AI paintings of generative adversarial networks and paintings of human artists, the perceptual complexity is taken as the dependent variable, and a regression model is established to analyze and calculate the complexity features of AI paintings, as well as to analyze the color matching art of AI paintings by combining the beauty calculation method. According to the comparison results, the AI paintings have a score of 3.71 for inspirational, 3.69 for aesthetic value, 3.52 for compositional rationality, and 3.38 for breakthrough. The AI paintings have a high level of thought and inspirational value.",

        "abstract": "Generating new, creative, and innovative ideas in the early stages of the design process is crucial for developing better and original products. Human designers may become too attached to specific design ideas, preventing them from generating new concepts and achieving ideal designs. To come up with original design ideas, a designer needs to have a creative mind, as well as knowledge, experience, and talent. Verbal, written, and visual sources of inspiration can also be valuable for generating ideas and concepts. This study presents a visual integration model that uses a data-supported Artificial Intelligence (AI) method to generate creative design ideas. The proposed model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) that combines target object and biological object images to produce new creative product images inspired by nature. The model was successfully applied to an aircraft design problem and the resulting sketches inspired designers to generate new and creative design ideas and variants in a case study. It was seen that this approach improved the quality of the ideas produced and simplified the idea and concept generation process.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe remarkable flexibility and adaptability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) have led to the proliferation of its models in bioinformatics research. Proteomic and transcriptomic profiles have been shown to be promising methods for discovering and identifying disease biomarkers. However, those analyses were performed by trained human examiners making the process tedious, time consuming, and hard to standardize. With the development of GANs, it is now possible to reduce computational costs and human time for bioinformatics analysis to produce effective biomarkers. Moreover, GANs help address the lack of phenotypic state transitional gene expression data as well as avoid protected human data constraints by generating RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) data from random vectors. The purpose of this review is to summarize the use of GAN approaches and techniques to augment RNA‐seq expression data and identify clinically useful biomarkers. We compare different studies that use different types of GAN models to examine the biomarkers. Also, we identify research gaps and challenges that apply GANs to bio‐informatics. Finally, we propose potential directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "The Intelligent Fault Diagnosis of rotating machinery calls for a substantial amount of training data, posing challenges in acquiring such data for damaged industrial machinery. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic data using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with cycle consistency loss function known as cycleGAN. The proposed method aims to generate synthetic data that could effectively replace real experimental data. The generative model is trained to transform wavelet images of simulated vibrational signals into authentic data obtained from machinery with damaged bearings. The utilization of Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrates a noteworthy resemblance between synthetic and real experimental data. Also, the generative model enables the synthesis of data that may have been entirely lacking from the experimental observation, indicating generative zero-shot learning capabilities. The efficacy of synthetic data in training diagnosis algorithms by means of Transfer Learning (TL) on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been demonstrated to be comparable to that of real data. The study has been validated by means of the test rig for medium-sized industrial bearings accessible at the Politecnico di Torino.",

        "abstract": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the expanding realm of cybersecurity, machine learning-based malware detection has emerged as a vital line of defense. However, the growing sophistication of malware attacks poses formidable challenges to conventional detection systems. To address this, this paper uses a Generative Adversarial Network that utilizes dual generators for adversarial learning on malware, designed to enhance the detection of harmful Portable Executable (PE) files. Our model employs a two-tiered generator system within the GAN architecture, where the secondary generator intervenes when the primary generator yields a malware PE executable dismissed by the detector.\r\nThe detection unit leverages ensemble learning techniques to analyze the PE software feature vector, capitalizing on the synergy of multiple learning models for improved performance and generalization. This setup empowers the system to generate a broader range of adversarial examples and respond to them effectively, enhancing the robustness of the detector against previously unseen or variable malware types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "abstract": "The evolving field of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly generative deep learning, is revolutionizing a host of scientific and technological sectors. One of the pivotal innovations within this domain is the emergence of generative adversarial networks (GANs). These unique models have shown remarkable capabilities in crafting synthetic data, closely emulating real-world distributions. Notably, their application to gene expression data systems is a fascinating and rapidly growing focus area. Restrictions related to ethical and logistical issues often limit the size, diversity, and data-gathering speed of gene expression data. Herein lies the potential of GANs, as they are capable of producing synthetic gene expression data, offering a potential solution to these limitations. This review provides a thorough analysis of the most recent advancements at this innovative crossroads of GANs and gene expression data, specifically during the period from 2019 to 2023. In the context of the fast-paced progress in deep learning technologies, accurate and inclusive reviews of current practices are critical to guiding subsequent research efforts, sharing knowledge, and catalyzing continual growth in the discipline. This review, through highlighting recent studies and seminal works, serves as a key resource for academics and professionals alike, aiding their journey through the compelling confluence of GANs and gene expression data systems.",

        "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is becoming more and more popular, artists use them to find their own inspirations, computer scientists use it for data synthesis, workers use it for machine fault diagnosis and so on. However, GANs are flawed despite its popularity: they are unstable. GANs are based on game theory. In a typical GAN model, the generator and the discriminator are both improved by competing with each other. Therefore, in this highly competitive training process, GANs can easily run into trouble while they move towards the optimal solution. In most cases, the case of such instability arises from the loss function, or in other words, the gradient of the loss function. This research proposed a new set of GAN that replaces its objective function with supcon, or the supervised contrastive loss to solve gradient-related problems. We have also proved that under our model, the GANs are less likely to suffer from these two factors of instability. Finally, we have compared our model and the traditional generative adversarial nets.",

        "abstract": "\nIntroduction:\nDeep neural networks due to their linear nature are sensitive to adversarial examples. They can easily be broken just by a small disturbance to the input data. Some of the existing methods to perform these kinds of attacks are pixel-level perturbation and spatial transformation of images.\n\n\nMethod:\nThese methods generate adversarial examples that can be fed to the network for wrong predictions. The drawback that comes with these methods is that they are really slow and computationally expensive. This research work performed a black box attack on the target model classifier by using the generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate adversarial examples that can fool a classifier model to classify the images as wrong classes. The proposed method used a biased dataset that does not contain any data of the target label to train the first generator Gnorm of the first stage GAN, and after the first training has finished, the second stage generator Gadv, which is a new generator model that does not take random noise as input but the output of the first generator Gnorm.\n\n\nResult:\nThe generated examples have been superimposed with the Gnorm output with a small constant, and then the superimposed data have been fed to the target model classifier to calculate the loss. Some additional losses have been included to constrain the generation from generating target examples.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed model has shown a better fidelity score, as evaluated using Fretchet inception distance score (FID), which was up to 42.43 in the first stage and up to 105.65 in the second stage with the attack success rate of up to 99.13%.\n",

        "abstract": "Phishing attacks pose a constant threat to online security, necessitating the development of efficient tools for identifying malicious URLs. In this article, we propose a novel approach to detect phishing URLs employing a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a variational autoencoder (VAE) as the generator and a transformer model with self-attention as the discriminator. The VAE generator is trained to produce synthetic URLs. In contrast, the transformer discriminator uses its self-attention mechanism to focus on the different parts of the input URLs to extract crucial features. Our model uses adversarial training to distinguish between legitimate and phishing URLs. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a large set of one million URLs that incorporate both authentic and phishing URLs. Experimental results show that our model is effective, with an impressive accuracy of 97.75%, outperforming the baseline models. This study significantly improves online security by offering a novel and highly accurate phishing URL detection method.",

Therefore, in this literature review, I seek to introduce Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to a broader audience by explaining their background and intuition at a more foundational level. I begin by discussing the mathematical background of this architecture, specifically topics in linear algebra and probability theory. I then proceed to introduce GANs in a more theoretical framework, along with some of the literature on GANs, including their architectural improvements and image-generation capabilities. Finally, I cover state-of-the-art image generation through style-based methods, as well as their implications on society.",

This paper presents a taxonomy that categorizes the applications and techniques of GANs in the context of DASH. The taxonomy covers several key dimensions, including video generation, compression, quality enhancement, bandwidth adaptation, dynamic bitrate streaming, and cross-modal applications. Within each dimension, specific subcategories are identified to capture the diverse applications of GANs in DASH. Additionally, evaluation metrics for assessing the quality and effectiveness of GAN-based approaches are discussed. The taxonomy serves as a comprehensive framework to understand and organize the different ways in which GANs can be utilized to improve the streaming experience in DASH. By providing an organized structure, this taxonomy facilitates better understanding, comparison, and exploration of GAN-based approaches in DASH and enables researchers and practitioners to identify areas for further research and development.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe wide applications of Generative adversarial networks benefit from the successful training methods, guaranteeing that an object function converges to the local minimum. Nevertheless, designing an efficient and competitive training method is still a challenging task due to the cyclic behaviors of some gradient-based ways and the expensive computational cost of acquiring the Hessian matrix. To address this problem, we proposed the Adaptive Composite Gradients(ACG) method, linearly convergent in bilinear games under suitable settings. Theory analysis and toy-function experiments both suggest that our approach alleviates the cyclic behaviors and converges faster than recently proposed SOTA algorithms. The convergence speed of the ACG is improved by 33% than other methods. Our ACG method is a novel Semi-Gradient-Free algorithm that can reduce the computational cost of gradient and Hessian by utilizing the predictive information in future iterations. The mixture of Gaussians experiments and real-world digital image generative experiments show that our ACG method outperforms several existing technologies, illustrating the superiority and efficacy of our method.",

The success of the method prominently relies on the geometry of the induced fractures in the host rock. An array of high-resolution tiltmeters is commonly used to measure the displacement gradient (tilt angle) of ground surface during hydraulic fracturing operation, and to infer the geometry of the induced fractures. In this work, we present a machine-learned model that is capable of predicting the surface tilt resulting from a pressurized fracture, using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). Fracture apertures along horizontal and vertical planes are given as input while surface tilt vectors are provided as output for the forward model. A 3D finite element model with discrete fractures is utilized as the Full Order Model (FOM) to create training data. The fractures are pressurized uniformly to induce a displacement at the ground surface. Images of the fracture aperture in XY and XZ planes, and surface tilt vector components (tilt X and tilt Y) are used for the training process. Three different loss functions are used, and the predicted tilts are compared to the real (FOM) tilts. The results show that the trained cGAN with Wasserstein loss and gradient penalty (W-model) can predict the ground surface tilt due to the pressurized fractures at variable dip angles.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHydraulic fracturing has been frequently applied as a preconditioning method to promote normal caving behavior in mining operations. The success of the method prominently relies on the geometry of the induced fractures in the stiff overburden layer. An array of high-resolution tiltmeters is commonly used to measure the displacement gradient (tilt angle) of ground surface during hydraulic fracturing operation, and to infer the geometry of the induced fractures or pressure plumes using simplified models (Lecampion et al., 2005; Salimzadeh et al., 2022).\n",

        "abstract": "In big data analysis, various zero-inflated problems are occurring. In particular, the problem of inflated zeros has a great influence on text big data analysis. In general, the preprocessed data from text documents are a matrix consisting of the documents and terms for row and column, respectively. Each element of this matrix is an occurred frequency of term in a document. Most elements of the matrix are zeros, because the number of columns is much larger than the rows. This problem is a cause of decreasing model performance in text data analysis. To overcome this problem, we propose a method of zero-inflated text data analysis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and statistical modeling. In this paper, we solve the zero-inflated problem using synthetic data generated from the original data with zero inflation. The main finding of our study is how to change zero values to the very small numeric values with random noise through the GAN. The generator and discriminator of the GAN learned the zero-inflated text data together and built a model that generates synthetic data that can replace the zero-inflated data. We conducted experiments and showed the results, using real and simulation data sets to verify the improved performance of our proposed method. In our experiments, we used five quantitative measures, prediction sum of squares, R-squared, log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion to evaluate the model’s performance between original and synthetic data sets. We found that all performances of our proposed method are better than the traditional methods.",

The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not generative AI can help increase human productivity, specifically in writing. We hypothesized that generative AI will have a positive impact on human productivity. In order to test this, we employed the use of participants to write short fictional stories, one with the help of AI and one without. They were provided with survey questions that helped assess any changes in productivity levels. The productivity of the participants was also analyzed in terms of grammar, spelling, and consistency while compared against time . With the results obtained, we hoped to assess how AI can impact productivity in creative tasks (i.e., writing, art). We also hoped to understand its broader applications for human use and potential benefits and caveats to using generative AI. Based on the results, we concluded that using generative AI did indeed improve writing productivity as it lowered the amount of errors and shortened the time taken. However, how productive the individual was in producing quality work of their own merit also depended on how much work they delegated to the generative AI as well as how they perceived it.    ",

Researchers have developed various types of GANs, such as Conditional GANs (CGANs), Mode Dropping GANs (MDGANs), and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), which have been applied to many different fields. Despite the success of GANs in various tasks, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. For example, model collapse, non-convergence, and diminished gradient could hinder the training of GANs. In this paper, the authors first introduce the basics of GANs before highlighting a few common problems associated with GANs and their corresponding solutions. For instance, they discuss techniques such as mini-batch discrimination and batch normalization that can help mitigate model collapse and diminish gradient problems. Additionally, they cover methods that can improve the convergence rate and stability of GANs, such as using alternative loss functions and incorporating regularization algorithms. Finally, this paper briefly introduces some recent applications of GANs in image generation, video prediction, and other areas. Despite the challenges that still exist, GANs have shown great promise in various fields, and with further research, GANs have the potential to become more robust and efficient models for generating high-quality synthetic data.",

However, collecting large image datasets in space for training neural networks is impractical, resulting in the use of synthetic images. Unfortunately, these often fail to accurately replicate real image features, leading to a significant domain gap. This work explores the use of generative adversarial networks as a solution for bridging this gap from the data level by making synthetic images more closely resemble real ones. A generative model is trained on a small subset of unpaired synthetic and real pictures from the SPEED+ dataset. The entire synthetic dataset is then augmented using the generator, and employed to train a regression model, based on the MetaFormer architecture, which locates a set of landmarks. By comparing the model's pose estimation accuracy on real images with and without generator preprocessing, it is observed that the augmentation effectively reduces the median pose estimation error by a factor 1.4 to 5. This compelling result validates the efficacy of these tools and justifies further research in their utilization. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn many areas of drive technology, condition monitoring of transmissions and drive systems is becoming an increasingly important discipline. Condition monitoring systems are used in many cases in combination with machine learning algorithms. The generation of a sufficient amount of data per condition class is relevant to ensure training stability and accuracy of the applied algorithms. Especially in early development phases a sufficient data generation is not often given. In the scope of this paper, a Generative Adversarial Network is applied to generate synthetic data and therefore extend existing measurement data sets. Acceleration data in three different condition classes is used, that has been collected on a gearbox as part of the PHM Data Challenge 2009. In order to highlight relevant features and reduce the number of data points, data is pre-processed via appropriate signal analysis techniques, in this case with the spectral kurtosis. It is shown, that in this use case the synthetically generated data via a Generative Adversarial Network has the same feature characteristics as the real measured data sets. The augmentation of the existing data set also improves the detection accuracy with artificial neural networks for the classification of different system states.",

        "abstract": "The effectiveness of adversarial generative networks (GANs) has been shown in many works. However, the convergence of the GANs should be granted mathematically with proper hyperparameters and some network structures. Considering the difficulties of constructing a large and clean dataset, GANs are required in many cases to extract enough information from a relatively small dataset. This could result in bad coverage performance of GANs, and one way to tackle this problem is pretraining. Since this method relies on importing external information from the pretraining dataset, this paper does a necessary discussion on the effect that the pretraining dataset has on the model and makes a simple assumption on the standard of choosing a pretraining dataset. Specifically, this paper focuses on the case where the target is to generate animation-style characters, and it has been proven that when providing a pretraining dataset with higher diversity, the performance of the GAN is better. The result of this paper should reveal the possibility that using a specially chosen pretraining dataset can improve the result of GAN.",

As a result, several artificial vision solutions based on pedestrian detection have been developed to assist drivers and reduce the number of accidents. Most pedestrian detection techniques work well on sunny days and provide accurate traffic data. However, detection decreases dramatically in rainy conditions. In this paper, a new pedestrian detection system (PDS) based on generative adversarial network (GAN) module and the real-time object detector you only look once (YOLO) v3 is proposed to mitigate adversarial weather attacks. Experimental evaluations performed on the VOC2014 dataset show that our proposed system performs better than models based on existing noise reduction methods in terms of accuracy for weather situations.</p>",

        "abstract": "This position paper explores the impact of generative AI on creativity and creative production in higher education, with focus also on initial teacher education. Creative outputs are an essential part of the business of higher education across different disciplinary areas, along with pedagogical and assessment practices matched to these outputs. However, the advent of generative AI has sparked a reconsideration of how we think about creativity, creative output, and the hybridity of relationships between generative AI and humans in creative endeavours. This emergent technology also has significant implications for teacher education and for the develop of new teachers who need confidence with using AI in learning contexts. We suggest that new thinking and critical dialogue are essential in developing educational futures in which generative AI is understood for its affordances, limitations, and dangers.",

        "abstract": "For a few decades, machine learning has been extensively utilized for turbulence research. The goal of this work is to investigate the reconstruction of turbulence from minimal or lower-resolution datasets as inputs using reduced-order models. This work seeks to effectively reconstruct high-resolution 3D turbulent flow fields using unsupervised physics-informed deep learning. The first objective of this study is to reconstruct turbulent channel flow fields and verify these with respect to the statistics. The second objective is to compare the turbulent flow structures generated from a GAN with a DNS. The proposed deep learning algorithm effectively replicated the first- and second-order statistics of turbulent channel flows of Reτ= 180 within a 2% and 5% error, respectively. Additionally, by incorporating physics-based corrections to the loss functions, the proposed algorithm was also able to reconstruct λ2 structures. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm can be useful for reconstructing a range of 3D turbulent flows given computational and experimental efforts.",

        "abstract": "Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have attracted tremendous attention nowadays due to their flexible maneuverability, precise control, cost efficiency, and low noise. The optimal takeoff trajectory design is a key component of cost-effective and passenger-friendly eVTOL systems. However, conventional design optimization is typically computationally prohibitive due to the adoption of high-fidelity simulation models in an iterative manner. Machine learning (ML) allows rapid decision making; however, new ML surrogate modeling architectures and strategies are still desired to address large-scale problems. Therefore, we showcase a novel regression generative adversarial network (regGAN) surrogate for fast interactive optimal takeoff trajectory predictions of eVTOL aircraft. The regGAN leverages generative adversarial network architectures for regression tasks with a combined loss function of a mean squared error (MSE) loss and an adversarial binary cross-entropy (BC) loss. Moreover, we introduce a surrogate-based inverse mapping concept into eVTOL optimal trajectory designs for the first time. In particular, an inverse-mapping surrogate takes design requirements (including design constraints and flight condition parameters) as input and directly predicts optimal trajectory designs, with no need to run design optimizations once trained. We demonstrated the regGAN on optimal takeoff trajectory designs for the Airbus A3 Vahana. The results revealed that regGAN outperformed reference surrogate strategies, including multi-output Gaussian processes and conditional generative adversarial network surrogates, by matching simulation-based ground truth with 99.6% relative testing accuracy using 1000 training samples. A parametric study showed that a regGAN surrogate with an MSE weight of one and a BC weight of 0.01 consistently achieved over 99.5% accuracy (denoting negligible predictive errors) using 400 training samples, while other regGAN models require at least 800 samples.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding natural selection and other forms of non-neutrality is a major focus for the use of machine learning in population genetics. Existing methods rely on computationally intensive simulated training data. Unlike efficient neutral coalescent simulations for demographic inference, realistic simulations of selection typically require slow forward simulations. Because there are many possible modes of selection, a high dimensional parameter space must be explored, with no guarantee that the simulated models are close to the real processes. Finally, it is difficult to interpret trained neural networks, leading to a lack of understanding about what features contribute to classification. Here we develop a new approach to detect selection and other local evolutionary processes that requires relatively few selection simulations during training. We build upon a generative adversarial network trained to simulate realistic neutral data. This consists of a generator (fitted demographic model), and a discriminator (convolutional neural network) that predicts whether a genomic region is real or fake. As the generator can only generate data under neutral demographic processes, regions of real data that the discriminator recognizes as having a high probability of being “real” do not fit the neutral demographic model and are therefore candidates for targets of selection. To incentivize identification of a specific mode of selection, we fine-tune the discriminator with a small number of custom non-neutral simulations. We show that this approach has high power to detect various forms of selection in simulations, and that it finds regions under positive selection identified by state-of-the-art population genetic methods in three human populations. Finally, we show how to interpret the trained networks by clustering hidden units of the discriminator based on their correlation patterns with known summary statistics.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is implemented by transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes through embedding space or feature generation. However, the embedding-based method has a hubness problem, and the generation-based method may contain considerable bias. To solve these problems, a joint model with multiple generative adversarial networks (JG-ZSL) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we combined the generation-based model and the embedding-based model to build a hybrid ZSL framework by mapping the real samples and the synthetic samples into the embedding space for classification, which alleviates the problem of data imbalance effectively. Secondly, based on the original generation-method model, a coupled GAN is introduced to generate semantic embeddings, which can generate semantic vectors for unseen classes in embedded space to alleviate the bias of mapping results. Finally, semantic-relevant self-adaptive margin center loss was used, which can explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, and it can also guide coupled GAN to generate discriminative and representative semantic features. All the experiments on the four standard datasets (CUB, AWA1, AWA2, SUN) show that the proposed method is effective.",

        "abstract": "Paranasal sinus pathologies, particularly those affecting the maxillary sinuses, pose significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to the complex anatomical structures and diverse disease manifestations. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of deep learning techniques, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for the classification of sinus pathologies in medical imaging data. The dataset is composed of images obtained through computed tomography (CT) scans, covering cases classified into “Moderate”, “Severe”, and “Normal” classes. The lightweight GAN is applied to augment a dataset by creating synthetic images, which are then used to train and test the ResNet-50 and ResNeXt-50 models. The model performance is optimized using random search to perform hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation is conducted extensively for various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately classifying sinus pathologies, with the ResNeXt-50 model achieving superior performance with accuracy: 91.154, precision: 0.917, recall: 0.912, and F1-score: 0.913 compared to ResNet-50. This study highlights the potential of GAN-based data augmentation and deep learning techniques in enhancing the diagnosis of maxillary sinus diseases.",

        "abstract": "Software defect prediction is an active research area. Researchers have proposed many approaches to overcome the imbalanced defect problem and build highly effective machine learning models that are not biased towards the majority class. Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are one of the state-of-the-art techniques that can be used to generate synthetic samples of the minority class and produce a balanced dataset. However, it was not investigated thoroughly in the area of imbalanced defect prediction. In this paper, we proposed to combine GAN-based methods with boosting ensembles to yield robust defect prediction models. GAN-based methods were used to balance the defect datasets, and the AdaBoost ensemble was employed to classify the modules into defective and non-defective modules. Our proposed approach was investigated within the context of 10 software defect datasets with different imbalance ratios. Wilcoxon effect size and Scott–Knott effect size difference tests were used as statistical tests to quantify the model’s performance differences statistically. Empirical results indicated that GAN-based methods need hyperparameter optimization when used for imbalanced software defect prediction. In comparison to the traditional sampling techniques, GAN methods outperformed all traditional techniques when used for imbalanced defect prediction. Lastly, results demonstrated that GAN-based methods should not be combined with undersampling to handle imbalance problems.",

After a large number of literature retrieval and attempts to classify from different aspects, we ultimately find out that GAN is one of the most famous and appropriate technologies widely adopted in academic research and commercial applications. Aiming at assisting reader with having insight into how GAN improved financial work’s efficiency, in this paper, we propose three research perspectives of GAN in financial work: Stock Market Prediction, Fault Detection, and Time Series. By organizing from an innovative and macro perspective, we present and classify the application methods of GAN and the improvement of the basic model of GAN in order to adapt to the corresponding fields under the corresponding research directions. In general, the following improved models based on the basic GAN model for the corresponding financial perspective are involved: GAN of three-layer dense network, GAN with the MLP and LSTM separately as the discriminator and the generator, GAN-FD stock projection model, BERT and GAN in Stock Prediction; SSGANs, DAEGAN in Fault Detection; SeqGAN, Quant GAN, RNN-GAN, PSA-GAN in Time Series.",

This study focuses on solving the current problem by utilizing variants of generative adversarial network, Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). In this study, OpenCV is employed to introduce fuzziness to the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, resulting in a blurred dataset. Subsequently, the research utilizes both the unaltered and blurred datasets to train the SRGAN model, which is then applied to enhance the low-quality dataset through inpainting. Moving forward, the original dataset, low-quality dataset, and the improved dataset are each used independently to train the DCGAN model.  In order to compare the difference between the produced image datasets and the real dataset, the FID Score is separately computed. The results of the study found that by training DCGAN with SRGAN repaired medical dataset, the naked eye can observe that the medical image dataset is significantly clearer and there is a reduction in Frchet Inception Distance (FID) Score. Therefore, by using SRGAN and DCGAN the current problem of low quality and small quantity of datasets in the medical field can be solved, which increase the potential possibilities of big data in artificial intelligence filed of medicine.",

        "abstract": "The most crucial component of any smart city traffic management system is traffic flow prediction. It can assist a driver in selecting the most efficient route to their destination. The digitalization of closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems has resulted in more effective and capable surveillance imaging systems for security applications. The number of automobiles on the world’s highways has steadily increased in recent decades. However, road capacity has not developed at the same rate, resulting in significantly increasing congestion. The model learning mechanism cannot be guided or improved by prior domain knowledge of real-world problems. In reality, symmetrical features are common in many real-world research objects. To mitigate this severe situation, the researchers chose adaptive traffic management to make intelligent and efficient use of the current infrastructure. Data grow exponentially and become a complex item that must be managed. Unstructured data are a subset of big data that are difficult to process and have volatile properties. CCTV cameras are used in traffic management to monitor a specific point on the roadway. CCTV generates unstructured data in the form of images and videos. Because of the data’s intricacy, these data are challenging to process. This study proposes using big data analytics to transform real-time unstructured data from CCTV into information that can be shown on a web dashboard. As a Hadoop-based architectural stack that can serve as the ICT backbone for managing unstructured data efficiently, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores several sorts of data using the Hadoop file storage system, a high-performance integrated virtual environment (HIVE) tables, and non-relational storage. Traditional computer vision algorithms are incapable of processing such massive amounts of visual data collected in real-time. However, the inferiority of traffic data and the quality of unit information are always symmetrical phenomena. As a result, there is a need for big data analytics with machine learning, which entails processing and analyzing vast amounts of visual data, such as photographs or videos, to uncover semantic patterns that may be interpreted. As a result, smart cities require a more accurate traffic flow prediction system. In comparison to other recent methods applied to the dataset, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy of 98.21%. In this study, we look at the construction of a secure CCTV strategy that predicts traffic from CCTV surveillance using real-time traffic prediction analysis with generative adversarial networks (GAN) and HDFS.",

Recent advancements in deep-learning technologies have triggered the implementation of research studies via mammography. Semi-supervised or unsupervised methods are often used to overcome the limitations of supervised learning, such as manpower and time, for labeling in clinical situations where abnormal data are significantly lacking. Accordingly, we proposed a generative model that uses a state-of-the-art generative network (StyleGAN2) to create high-quality synthetic mammographic images and an anomaly detection method to detect breast cancer on mammograms in unsupervised methods. The generation model was trained via only normal mammograms and breast cancer classification was performed via anomaly detection using 50 breast cancer and 50 normal mammograms that did not overlap with the dataset for generative model learning. Our generative model has shown comparable fidelity to real images, and the anomaly detection method via this generative model showed high sensitivity, demonstrating its potential for breast cancer screening. This method could differentiate between normal and cancer-positive mammogram and help overcome the weakness of current supervised methods.",

However, GANs still suffer from drawbacks such as mode collapse and training instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Auto-Encoding GAN, which is composed of a set of generators, a discriminator, an encoder, and a decoder. The set of generators is responsible for learning diverse modes, and the discriminator is used to distinguish between real samples and generated ones. The encoder maps generated and real samples to the embedding space to encode distinguishable features, and the decoder determines from which generator the generated samples come and from which mode the real samples come. They are jointly optimized in training to enhance the feature representation. Moreover, a clustering algorithm is employed to perceive the distribution of real and generated samples, and an algorithm for cluster center matching is accordingly constructed to maintain the consistency of the distribution, thus preventing multiple generators from covering a certain mode. Extensive experiments are conducted on two classes of datasets, and the results visually and quantitatively demonstrate the preferable capability of the proposed model for reducing mode collapse and enhancing feature representation.",

        "abstract": "Due to corrosion characteristics, there are data scarcity and uneven distribution in corrosion datasets, and collecting high-quality data is time-consuming and sometimes difficult. Therefore, this work introduces a novel data augmentation strategy using a conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) for enhancing corrosion datasets of pipelines. Firstly, the corrosion dataset is subjected to data cleaning and variable correlation analysis. The CTGAN is then used to generate external environmental factors as input variables for corrosion growth prediction, and a hybrid model based on machine learning is employed to generate corrosion depth as an output variable. The fake data are merged with the original data to form the synthetic dataset. Finally, the proposed data augmentation strategy is verified by analyzing the synthetic dataset using different visualization methods and evaluation indicators. The results show that the synthetic and original datasets have similar distributions, and the data augmentation strategy can learn the distribution of real corrosion data and sample fake data that are highly similar to the real data. Predictive models trained on the synthetic dataset perform better than predictive models trained using only the original dataset. In comparative tests, the proposed strategy outperformed other data generation methods.",
