        "abstract": "Robots can be equipped with a range of senses to allow them to perceive and interact with the world in a more natural and intuitive way. These senses can include vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Vision allows the robot to see and recognize objects and navigate its environment. Hearing enables the robot to recognize sounds and respond to vocal commands. Touch allows the robot to perceive information about the texture, shape, and temperature of objects through the sense of touch. Smell enables the robot to recognize and classify different odors. Taste enables the robot to identify the chemical composition of materials. The specific senses used in a robot will depend on the needs of the application, and many robots use a combination of different senses to perceive and interact with the environment. This paper reviews the five senses used in robots, their types, how they work, and other related information, while also discussing the possibility of a Sixth Sense.",

A three-year experience of the course of “robotic system design” is presented to support the validity of the use of this technology in teaching. This course is specifically aimed at Master of Science (MSc) Mechanical Engineering students and therefore requires one to view the subject in all its aspects including those which are not conventionally taken into consideration such as mechanical design, prototyping and the final realization.",

One of the ways to assess the achieved level of development and qualifications of engineering teams is to hold competitions at various levels. The article provides an overview of various events in competitive robotics. In the first part, the competition in the ground and underground environment is considered. The competitions are structured according to the format, type of the competition, the environment of functioning and the age of the participants. Conclusions are made about the prospects of various events of competitive robotics, as well as the relevance of some of them.",

Subsequently, the proposed variational method lends itself to more flexible solutions than prior methodologies. Furthermore, the derived method is verified both through simulations with multiple mobile robots and a real world experiment with two mobile robots. In both cases, the robots share the operating space and need to cross each other’s paths multiple times without colliding.",

Today, it is possible to envision social robots in tasks that were not expected years ago, and that is not only due to the evolution of social robots, but also to the evolution of the vision humans have for them. This survey addresses recent advances in social robotics from different perspectives. Different contexts and areas of application of social robots are addressed, as well as modalities of interaction with humans. Different robotic platforms used in social contexts are shown and discussed. Relationships of social robotics with advances in other technological areas are surveyed, and methods and metrics used for the human evaluation of the interaction with robots are presented. The future of social robotics is also envisioned based on surveyed works and from different points of view.",

Cloud computing empowers robots by offering them faster and more powerful computational capabilities through massively parallel computation and higher data storage facilities. It also offers access to open-source, big datasets and software, cooperative learning capabilities through knowledge sharing, and human knowledge through crowdsourcing. The recent progress in cloud robotics has led to active research in this area spanning from the development of cloud robotics architectures to its varied applications in different domains. In this survey paper, we review the recent works in the area of cloud robotics technologies as well as its applications. We draw insights about the current trends in cloud robotics and discuss the challenges and limitations in the current literature, open research questions and future research directions.",

        "abstract": "The landscape of neurorehabilitation is undergoing a profound transformation with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven robotics. This review addresses the pressing need for advancements in pediatric neurorehabilitation and underscores the pivotal role of AI-driven robotics in addressing existing gaps. By leveraging AI technologies, robotic systems can transcend the limitations of preprogrammed guidelines and adapt to individual patient needs, thereby fostering patient-centric care. This review explores recent strides in social and diagnostic robotics, physical therapy, assistive robotics, smart interfaces, and cognitive training within the context of pediatric neurorehabilitation. Furthermore, it examines the impact of emerging AI techniques, including artificial emotional intelligence, interactive reinforcement learning, and natural language processing, on enhancing cooperative neurorehabilitation outcomes. Importantly, the review underscores the imperative of responsible AI deployment and emphasizes the significance of unbiased, explainable, and interpretable models in fostering adaptability and effectiveness in pediatric neurorehabilitation settings. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of AI-driven robotics in pediatric neurorehabilitation and offers valuable insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers.",
