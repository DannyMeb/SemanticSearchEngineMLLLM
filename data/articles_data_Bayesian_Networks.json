Precedent work proposed a metabolic network-based method in biomass prediction of Arabidopsis; however, the method consists of multiple steps that possibly degrade prediction accuracyResultsWe proposed a Bayesian model that integrates all steps and jointly infers all fluxes of reactions related to biomass production. The proposed model showed higher accuracies than methods compared both in simulated and real data.

        "abstract": "Bayesian Networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical statistical models that have been widely used in many fields over the last decade. This method, which can also be used for educational data mining (EDM) purposes, is a fairly new method in education literature. This study models students' science success using the BN approach. Science is one of the core areas in the PISA exam. To this end, we used the data set including the most successful 25% and the least successful 25% students from Turkey based on their scores from Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey. We also made the feature selection to determine the most effective variables on success. The accuracy value of the BN model created with the variables determined by the feature selection is 86.2%. We classified effective variables on success into three categories; individual, family-related and school-related. Based on the analysis, we found that family-related variables are very effective in science success, and gender is not a discriminant variable in this success. In addition, this is the first study in the literature on the evaluation of complex data made with the BN model. In this respect, it serves as a guide in the evaluation of international exams and in the use of the data obtained.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) can be used for the discovery of gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression data. Here, we suggest a strategy for learning DBNs from gene expression data by employing a Bayesian approach that is scalable to large networks and is targeted at learning models with high predictive accuracy. Our framework can be used to learn DBNs for multiple groups of samples and highlight differences and similarities in their gene regulatory networks. We learn these DBN models based on different structural and parametric assumptions and select the optimal model based on the cross-validated predictive accuracy. We show in simulation studies that our approach is better equipped to prevent overfitting than techniques used in previous studies. We applied the proposed DBN-based classification approach to two time series transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, each comprising data from distinct phenotypic groups of the same tissue type. In the first case, we used DBNs to characterize responders and non-responders to anti-cancer therapy. In the second case, we compared normal to tumor cells of colorectal tissue. The classification accuracy reached by the DBN-based classifier for both datasets was higher than reported previously. For the colorectal cancer dataset, our analysis suggested that GRNs for cancer and normal tissues have a lot of differences, which are most pronounced in the neighborhoods of oncogenes and known cancer tissue markers. The identified differences in gene networks of cancer and normal cells may be used for the discovery of targeted therapies.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAllopolyploid species are formed by genome doubling after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Allopolyploidy is a common speciation mechanism in land plants. Here we describe and evaluate a Bayesian approach to the phylogenetic analysis of species relationships when both ordinary speciation and allopolyploidy are present. The approach takes incomplete lineage sorting into account using the multi-species coalescent model, and extends this to deal with the extra complications due to allopolyploidy. The number of hybridizations is not assumed, which means that the number of parameters varies and a reversible-jump MCMC algorithm is needed to sample from the posterior. The main restriction is that only diploids and allotetraploids are considered. The model is implemented in the BEAST framework and is an extension of Jones et al. (2013). Simulations show that the topology of the network can be reliably inferred along with estimates of other parameters.",

The ideas are first explained in terms of a small, standard example that explores two alternative hypotheses for why the grass is wet: the sprinkler is on versus it is raining. The chapter describes how to depict causal models graphically with the use of influence diagrams and directed acyclic graphs. Bayes’ Theorem is used to compute conditional probabilities and to update probabilities once new information is obtained or assumed. The software program Netica is introduced. Finally, the chapter provides a second example of Bayesian networks based on The Lorax by Dr. Seuss. The reader will gain a firm understanding of parent nodes (also known as root nodes), child nodes, conditional probability tables (CPTs), and the chain rule for joint probability.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have received more and more attention because they are capable of modeling epistemic uncertainty which is hard for conventional neural networks. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and variational inference (VI) are two mainstream methods for Bayesian deep learning. The former is effective but its storage cost is prohibitive since it has to save many samples of neural network parameters. The latter method is more time and space efficient, however the approximate variational posterior limits its performance. In this paper, we aim to combine the advantages of above two methods by distilling MCMC samples into an approximate variational posterior. On the basis of an existing distillation technique we first propose variational Bayesian dark knowledge method. Moreover, we propose Bayesian dark prior knowledge, a novel distillation method which considers MCMC posterior as the prior of a variational BNN. Two proposed methods both not only can reduce the space overhead of the teacher model so that are scalable, but also maintain a distilled posterior distribution capable of modeling epistemic uncertainty. Experimental results manifest our methods outperform existing distillation method in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty modeling.",

        "abstract": "Accidents in process industries include fires, explosions, or toxic releases depending on the spilled material properties and  ignition sources. One of the worst phenomena that may occur is the called domino effect. This triggers serious consequences  on the people, the environment, and the economy. That is why the European Commission defined the domino effect prediction  as a mandatory challenge for the years ahead. The quantification of the domino effect probability is a complex task due to the  multiple and synergic effects among all accidents that should be included in the analysis. However, these techniques could be  integrated with others in order to represent the domino effect occurrence reliably. In this matter, artificial intelligence plays  a vital role. Bayesian networks, as one of the artificial intelligence nets, have been widely applied for domino effect likelihood  determination.  This  research  aims  to  provide  a  guide  for  quantifying  domino  effect  probability  using  Bayesian  networks   in  a  hydrocarbon  processing  area.  For  this  purpose,  a  four-step  model  is  proposed  integrating  some  classical  risk  analysis   techniques with Bayesian networks. Moreover, this methodology is applied to an actual hydrocarbon storage and processing  facility. After that, the joint probability can reach 9.37% for the process unit tank 703 which storages naphtha. Hence, safety  management plans must be improved in this area for reducing this actual risk level. Finally, this research demonstrates how  Artificial intelligence techniques should be integrated with classical ones in order to get more reliable results.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWorking memories are thought to be held in attractor networks in the brain. These attractors should keep track of the uncertainty associated with each memory, so as to weigh it properly against conflicting new evidence. However, conventional attractors do not represent uncertainty. Here we show how uncertainty could be incorporated into an attractor, specifically a ring attractor that encodes head direction. First, we introduce the first rigorous normative framework (the circular Kalman filter) for benchmarking the performance of a ring attractor under conditions of uncertainty. Next we show that the recurrent connections within a conventional ring attractor can be re-tuned to match this benchmark. This allows the amplitude of network activity to grow in response to confirmatory evidence, while shrinking in response to poor-quality or strongly conflicting evidence. This “Bayesian ring attractor” performs near-optimal angular path integration and evidence accumulation. Indeed, we show that a Bayesian ring attractor is consistently more accurate than a conventional ring attractor. Moreover, near-optimal performance can be achieved without exact tuning of the network connections. Finally, we use large-scale connectome data to show that the network can achieve near-optimal performance even after we incorporate biological constraints. Our work demonstrates how attractors can implement a dynamic Bayesian inference algorithm in a biologically plausible manner, and it makes testable predictions with direct relevance to the head direction system, as well as any neural system that tracks direction, orientation, or periodic rhythms.Significance StatementData from human subjects as well as animals shows that working memories are associated with a sense of uncertainty. Indeed, a sense of uncertainty is what allows an observer to properly weigh new evidence against their current memory. However, we do not understand how the brain tracks uncertainty. Here we describe a simple and biologically plausible network model that can track the uncertainty associated with a working memory. The representation of uncertainty in this model improves the accuracy of its working memory, as compared to conventional models, because it assigns the proper weight to new conflicting evidence. Our model provides a new interpretation for observed fluctuations in brain activity, and it makes testable new predictions.",
