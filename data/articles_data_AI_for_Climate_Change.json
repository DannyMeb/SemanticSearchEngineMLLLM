        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change is one of the most pressing global challenges we face today. The impacts of rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are already being felt around the world and are only expected to worsen in the coming years. To mitigate and adapt to these impacts, we need innovative, data-driven solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for climate change adaptation, offering a range of capabilities that can help identify vulnerable areas, simulate future climate scenarios, and assess risks and opportunities for businesses and infrastructure. With the ability to analyze large volumes of data from climate models, satellite imagery, and other sources, AI can provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making and help us prepare for the impacts of climate change. However, the use of AI in climate change adaptation also raises important ethical considerations and potential biases that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy these solutions, it is crucial to ensure that they are transparent, fair, and equitable. In this context, this article explores the latest innovations and future directions in AI-enabled climate change adaptation strategies, highlighting both the potential benefits and the ethical considerations that must be considered. By harnessing the power of AI for climate change adaptation, we can work towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThose concerned with climate governance will want to keep watching what is happening in AI governance. Far from unrelated, the two parallel one another in terms of how fractions of capital—whether within fossil fuel or tech sectors—call for legislating in the face of crisis or for voluntary pledges. In truth, both may be said to be forms of self‐governance. Climate and AI intersect firstly in how they are imagined: dominant climate and AI discourses are both symptoms of Anthropocene thinking and ‘capitalist realism’. They also intersect in as much as ‘AI for Good’ initiatives propose that AI is ethical because it can help to address climate change. What seems missing, however, is any consideration of this climate AI as a procedure—is its knowledge valid, what knowledges does it displace or exclude, what biases are reproduced?—and consideration for its consequences, including harms. Does it actually result in climate mitigation and/or adaptation in a given context? What ‘maladaptive’ outcomes might it drive? What alternatives does it foreclose? These sorts of questions are ones where geographers will continue to have a lot to say.",

We call for an intersectional and decolonial approach to better understand how disabilities intersect with social and structural injustices in urban settings to shape diverse responses to climate change and disasters. We highlight the economic, socio‐cultural, and embodied challenges that increase vulnerability to—and ability to recover from—disasters including urban flooding and earthquakes. We draw on ethnographic and visual data from our research, including a comic illustrated by Ariel and Zaldi and sketches by Rizaldi, to centre diverse lived experiences of structural vulnerabilities and socio‐cultural marginalisation, particularly concerning education and livelihoods. Foregrounding life stories in this way serves to challenge the absence of meaningful engagement of people with disabilities in disaster risk reduction and climate change actions and decision‐making. Our article highlights disability as a site of both discrimination and critical embodied knowledge, simultaneously a product of structural, socio‐cultural, political, and environmental injustice while also a source of innovation, resilience, and agency.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses a notable gap in the climate change literature by examining the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI–ML) in urban climate change adaptation and sustainable development across major global continents. While much attention has been given to mitigation strategies, this study uniquely delves into the AI–ML’s underexplored role in catalyzing climate change adaptation in contemporary and future urban centers. The research thoroughly explores diverse case studies from Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America, and South America, utilizing a methodological framework involving six-step and five-step models for systematic literature reviews. The findings underscore AI–ML achievements, illuminate challenges, and emphasize the need for context-specific and collaborative approaches. The findings imply that a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient. Instead, successful adaptation strategies must be intricately linked to the particular characteristics, vulnerabilities, and intricacies of each region. Furthermore, the research underscores the importance of international collaboration, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer to expedite the integration of AI–ML into climate adaptation strategies globally. The study envisions a promising trajectory for AI–ML in the climate adaptation domain, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing research, innovation, and practical AI–ML applications. As climate change remains a defining challenge, this research predicts an increasingly pivotal role for AI–ML in constructing climate-resilient urban centers and promoting sustainable development. Continuous efforts to advance AI–ML technologies, establish robust policy frameworks, and ensure universal access are crucial for harnessing AI–ML’s transformative capabilities to combat climate change consequences.",

        "citations": 8,
        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change can be construed as a question of collective responsibility from two different viewpoints: climate change being inherently a collective problem, or collective entities bearing responsibility for climate change. When discussing collective responsibility for climate change, “collective” can thus refer to the problem of climate change itself, or to the entity causing the harm and/or bearing responsibility for it. The first viewpoint focuses on how climate change is a harm that has been caused collectively.Collective action problemrefers to an aggregation of individual actions which together produce an outcome that is not intended at the level of an individual action. It cannot be solved by any one agent acting unilaterally. Instead, climate change action must be enacted and supported by numerous agents. The second way to conceptualize climate change as a question of collective responsibility focuses on the collective entities that bear responsibility for climate change. As a global problem, climate change is linked to the realm of international politics, where states, governments, and intergovernmental organizations are the main collective entities. Other important agential collectives in terms of climate responsibility are corporations, including carbon majors who have produced the bulk of emissions. Climate change has also been theorized as astructural injustice, which combines elements from both the viewpoints on what is collective about responsibility for climate change.This article is categorized under:Climate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate ChangeClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere is increasing public debate about the governance of climate change and its repercussions for nature and human livelihoods. In today's digitalized communication landscape, both public and private actors involved in climate change governance use social media to provide information and to interact with stakeholders and the broader public. This Focus Article discusses two main aspects of debates about climate change and climate governance on Twitter, which previous theories suggest to shape climate governance across domestic and global levels: non‐state climate action and public opinion formation on the social media. We see significant advancement in the environmental social sciences studying these two areas. Yet, we also see the need for a better understanding of how public and private actors in the climate governance complex interact on Twitter, and how these actors shape, and are shaped by, experiences, values, and positions. This understanding will help to advance climate governance theories. This article proceeds in three steps. We first discuss previous social media research on non‐state climate action and public opinion formation related to climate change and its governance. Then we sketch avenues for future research, elaborating how Twitter data might be used to investigate how non‐state climate action and public opinion formation on social media are linked to and influence climate governance. We conclude by making the case for drawing together Twitter data and climate governance research into a more coherent research agenda.This article is categorized under:\nPolicy and Governance > Private Governance of Climate Change\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Communication\nPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy\nPolicy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance\n",

        "abstract": "The impact of global warming on the environment is a significant concern, and finding effective ways to address climate change is a priority. This paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be utilised to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support efforts to combat climate change, with a particular focus on the chemical industry. The study presents a theoretical framework and comparative analysis of both technological and non-technological solutions to achieve net-zero GHG emissions and establish a carbon-neutral status in the chemical industry. The aim is to assess the potential role of AI as a tool for reducing CO2 emissions from the chemical industry and contributing to the global goal of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions. The analysis will evaluate the efficacy of AI as a tool in reducing GHG emissions in the chemical industry and explore its potential for optimising processes, predicting and reducing emissions, and supporting the development of sustainable practices. By utilising AI, it may be possible to identify and implement effective solutions that may not have been possible through conventional methods. Ultimately, the study aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to address climate change by highlighting the potential of AI as a tool for reducing GHG emissions in the chemical industry.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article presents a new interpretive framework for understanding the implications of climate change for migration, and reviews and reflects on existing evidence and research gaps in light of this framework. Most existing climate‐migration research is heavily environment‐centric, even when acknowledging the importance of contextual or intervening factors. In contrast, the framework proposed here considers five different pathways through which climate change is affecting, or might affect, migration: short‐term shocks, long‐term climatic and related changes, environmental “pull” factors, climate adaptation and mitigation measures, and perceptions and narratives. In reviewing the existing evidence relating to each of these pathways, the paper finds among other things that short‐term shocks may simultaneously increase and reduce migration; that the evidence on long‐term trends provides a weak basis for understanding future dynamics; and that more attention needs to be paid to the other three pathways, by researchers and policymakers alike. Overall, the proposed framework and associated evidence review suggest a different and broader understanding of the migration implications of climate change from that outlined in the IPCC's most recent assessment, or in many existing reviews.This article is categorized under:\nClimate and Development Knowledge and Action in Development\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThough it is often said that climate change is a risk to people's well‐being, the specific ways in which it affects people's well‐being is still poorly understood, especially as it relates to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Two interrelated issues contribute to this gap in knowledge: (1) the use of different conceptualizations of well‐being across disciplines; and (2) the limited use of local and context‐specific understandings of well‐being that are meaningful to people exposed to climate change. Here, we review 103 articles covering the topic of climate change adaptation and well‐being. We find that, despite the growing interest on the topic, most of the articles do not include definitions of well‐being. We then propose an approach informed by emic values to better understand how climate change may affect well‐being in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. We conclude that, given the increasing recognition of well‐being as a fundamental marker of successful adaptation, well‐being should be central to climate change research and policymaking, but for this to be of benefit to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities context‐specific understandings of well‐being are necessary.This article is categorized under:\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\nClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well‐Being\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge\n",

This advanced review offers a critical overview of the key themes of this literature with the primary intention of enabling historians and other scholars to recognize, specify, and acknowledge the roles of imperial and colonial processes in shaping scientific framings of climate. Following a brief overview of debates in older literature over the significance of imperialism and colonialism in climate sciences, the article investigates the wealth of recent scholarship that demonstrates specific and diverse connections between empires and climate science. Major features of this scholarship include: the role and the erasure of Indigenous and local knowledge; imperial climate infrastructures and visions; and climate data and theories in land empires as well as in informal empires and neocolonial settings. Through critically engaging these themes, the article seeks to help historians identify avenues for future research.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > World Historical Perspectives\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Global Climate Change are two developments that will come to define the twenty‐first century. As such, examining their intersections is crucial and can yield important insights. Geography is well positioned to study these intersections through its diverse conceptual and methodological toolkit, which bridges the physical and environmental science, the social sciences and the humanities, as well as the human and more‐than‐human worlds. A first step in deploying a geographic analysis can be to ground the links between AI and Global Climate Change in concrete geographic contexts. I illustrate this exercise in the paragraphs that follow and identify its productive potential. Specifically, this text deploys a geographic perspective grounded in political economy to connect concerns about the data and energy inequalities embedded in various AI applications while showing how such inequalities are intertwined both with the monitoring of Global Climate Change and with its material impacts.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMany now argue that we should think about the previously unthinkable risks of climate change, including societal collapses and human extinction. Calamitous images of the future are not pathological or counterproductive: it is both necessary and valuable to imagine the worst‐case scenarios of climate change. Critics of climate catastrophe often group together all visions of disastrous futures under labels like doomism or pessimism. This is unhelpful and greater nuance is required. We need to distinguish between climate doomists (who see catastrophe as imminent and unavoidable) and climate risk realists (who see catastrophe as one potential future that should be avoided). We also need to split apart the different ways of envisioning climate catastrophe to understand their distinct strengths and weaknesses. We outline and compare three alternative modes of viewing the worst‐case scenarios of climate change: foresight, agitation, and fiction. The first centers on modeling catastrophic climate scenarios, the second on the use of images of climate catastrophe for political action, and the third on fictional visions of future climate disasters. These different approaches are complementary and should be better integrated to create more comprehensive models of the future. All of them would benefit from viewing the future as uncertain, reflecting on the social position of the author, and guarding against the authoritarian “stomp reflex” that can be induced by discussions of crisis and emergency.This article is categorized under:\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Perceptions of Climate Change\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\n",

Descriptive data were obtained on different aspects of psychological distance such as temporal, social, geographical and uncertainty. The study also evaluated the relationship between contact with nature through climate change and climate denial. The research is a descriptive study. Climate change denial scale and nature contact scales were used to measure the levels of climate change denial and contact with nature. Data were collected online from 123 people living in different geographical regions of Turkey. Group comparison findings based on individuals' assessments of their political views (left/right) are consistent with the literature. Significant differences in denial of climate change were observed among groups separated by political views. In addition, a significant relationship was found between age and denial of climate change. Our findings are important in terms of revealing some social and cognitive factors in the perception of the climate change problem in our country and helping to develop more effective strategies in combating climate change.",

The ethics of climate activism has focused on two main questions. First, is there a duty to engage in climate activism? Answers to this question differ regarding how the duty is grounded, how demanding it is, and whether people in certain social roles have special duties to engage in climate activism. The second question is whether certain forms of climate activism are morally permissible, given certain frequently voiced concerns. Prominently, concerns about climate activism being ineffective, uninclusive, undemocratic, and violent.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe uncertainty in the climate projection arising from various climate models is very common, and averaging such results poses a risk of underestimation or sometimes overestimation of impact in magnitude and frequency. Further, the performance of various climate models in monsoon degrades drastically due to the skewed nature. Under these circumstances, the performance of the climate model in the monsoon and non-monsoon periods is critical for accurate assessment. A multimodal approach has been used in the present work to quantify the uncertainty involved in the climate model using reliability ensemble averaging (REA). Based on AR6 of IPCC, the ensemble of 26 global climate models (GCMs) was used to evaluate the model performance and possible change in seasonal precipitation in four cities with distinct climate conditions, namely, Coimbatore, Rajkot, Udaipur, and Siliguri. The results show that non-monsoon and monsoon rainfall are expected to increase in all the regions. Most of the models perform poorly in simulating monsoon climate, especially in the monsoon period and are highly inconsistent spatially. The study also finds that the model performance is largely linked to the ratio of natural variability and mean.",

        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change is arguably the most severe threat faced by humanity today. In an attempt to understand how humanity can manage this phenomenon for planetary health, it is fundamental to have an understanding of what it is. This aligns with a critical gap in the extant literature, that is, how different perceptions of climate change among facilitators of learning (in this case, academics) can enable the establishment of a framework of critical consciousness that could boost climate change education and contribute to climate change management. To this end, the study that underpins this paper set out to capture the perceptions of climate change among a selection of academics at a local university in Cameroon. Following a comprehensive analysis of the data, different views on the subject emerged, aligning with scientific, observational, and cultural definitions. Drawing on theoretical insights into critical consciousness, the findings of this study have wider implications for climate change education at universities. A framework is suggested to support educators as they foster critical thinking among learners, as this can facilitate their ability and the wider community to make informed decisions on mitigation and adaptation strategies in light of climate change and the threats it carries.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGlobally, cultural heritage is on the front line of anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, it could be argued that climate change should now be a primary lens through which cultural heritage conservation and management are viewed. We argue that addressing the growing and compounding risks and impacts of climate change requires a fundamental rethink and transformation of cultural heritage management and policy. In this article, we propose a climate‐smart cultural heritage (CSCH) approach that captures the notion that climate adaptation can be developed and implemented within the heritage sector to simultaneously reduce the impacts of changing climate and variability on tangible and intangible cultural heritage and provide co‐benefits for climate change mitigation while also enhancing human security at different spatial scales. The CSCH is an integrated approach to implementing forward‐looking and transformative cultural heritage management and policy and is not a new set of practices to be advocated to cultural heritage stakeholders and decision‐makers. Findings also demonstrate that institutional mechanisms such as multi‐stakeholder planning, increased awareness of the economic, social, and environmental benefits of diverse cultural heritage, improved cross‐sectoral coordination and communication, strong political will for transformative approaches, and investments in CSCH are necessary for implementation of CSCH.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change > Assessing Climate Change in the Context of Other Issues\n",

This is despite the fact that law and legal authority are implicated in most, if not all, of the ways in which actors seek to reduce the risks posed to communities by climate change. Using a scoping review methodology, this article examines the intersection of climate change adaptation and legal culture in existing research. Overall, we find that the significance of legal culture for adaptation actions has been under‐explored. Yet, it is also clear that a focus on legal culture holds significant promise for our understanding of climate change adaptation. We set out a research agenda for the field, highlighting the ways in which a focus on legal culture may enrich existing key themes within climate change adaptation research.This article is categorized under:\nPolicy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in Communities, Cities, and Regions\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Institutions for Adaptation\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractMaterial efficiency (ME), making products with less material or substituting with less carbon‐intensive material without a loss of functionality, can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and complement other strategies to mitigate climate change. Seven ME strategies for cars and homes in the G7 countries were recently modeled in a study by the International Resource Panel. Modeling indicates that ME strategies focusing on construction and use of homes could lower the overall cumulative emissions in the G7 between 2016 and 2060 by 8.5 Gt CO2e (20%), while ME strategies for the production and use of cars could reduce up to 12 Gt (24%). For both homes and cars, the strategy of more intensive use—where fewer or smaller products are required to provide the same basic service—showed the greatest potential. A review of existing ME policies reveals that attention to ME in climate policy has been limited. Policy toward ME has historically focused on waste management rather than GHG reduction. Ex post evaluation of policies that do exist, especially for recycling and related waste strategies, is infrequent. Framing efficient use of materials as a measure primarily intended for climate mitigation is relatively recent and uncommon. Production‐related policy opportunities have been neglected because using ME to reduce GHGs is novel in some sectors and because increased ME faces economic and social barriers. Rebound effects where reduction of the cost of housing or transportation can increase material consumption offsetting potential gains, a problem for all efficiency‐based approaches, is understudied and not currently addressed through policy.This article is categorized under:\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Policies, Instruments, Lifestyles, Behavior\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Decarbonizing Energy and/or Reducing Demand\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractPekrun and his colleagues highlight the significance and diversity of emotion in education. Their analysis suggests that these emotions can be categorised by their stimuli into those related to the classroom: activities, outcomes, relationships, topics and knowledge processes (epistemic). Most research in this area has focused on achievement emotions, with relatively limited research exploring topic emotions. This paper develops a framework for conceptualising topic emotions. It reports on a design‐based study that captured children's expressions of emotion in response to a climate change education programme using picturebooks. The data brought together emotional responses to climate change, to learning about climate change and to climate‐related picturebooks. Qualitative analysis of these responses highlights how they differ not only with regard to the emotions expressed, but also the structure of the emotional experience. Emotional responses to the broad topic of climate change were expressed as ongoing analytical judgements, where those related to learning about climate change were immersive and finite. Reading climate‐related picturebooks involved exploring how emotion is communicated and evoked. This supported quasi‐emotional experiences, where the reader imagines the emotions of the characters. The picturebooks are also shown to create vicarious emotional experiences, involving ethical‐based responses to the behaviour and circumstances depicted. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a framework for disaggregating these differing emotional experiences related to topic.",

In this overview, I survey the main lenses through which various actors have linked climate justice and reproductive justice in the United States. First, I review the literatures: on climate justice, the perspective that those who are least responsible for the conditions causing climate change are disproportionately impacted by it; and on the reproductive justice, which focuses on rejecting reproductive oppression to achieve comprehensive reproductive autonomy for individuals and communities. Next, I analyze frameworks that seek to reframe reproductive justice through a populationist, climate‐centered lens. I contrast these framings with new approaches focused on racial health disparities and intergenerational justice. The article ends with questions about the next directions in climate justice and reproductive justice linkages: in particular, the role of eco‐anxiety in shaping reproductive futures. In so doing, I argue for approaches that challenge mainstream framings focused on population size and growth, and instead foreground the embodied reproductive outcomes of climate‐impacted communities.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\n",

The primary objective is to enhance the heat resistance capabilities of materials crucial for geothermal energy extraction, a key renewable energy source with minimal carbon footprint. Presently, Iceland leads in global geothermal energy production, emphasizing the significance of optimizing extraction methods. Previous research faced challenges due to suboptimal material selection, hindering drilling to greater depths. This study proposes a novel solution—employing innovative material coatings on drilling bits and pipes, utilizing metallic compounds with exceptional heat resistance properties. The coating strategy involves leaving pipes uncoated up to a depth where they naturally withstand heat, with subsequent application for greater depths. This approach promises cost-effective materials capable of enduring extreme conditions in geothermal drilling, fostering higher drilling depths and cost efficiency. Implementation projections suggest significant facilitation of geothermal energy extraction, particularly in abandoned wells near tectonic plate boundaries, reducing extraction costs. The study underscores the societal benefits of tapping into indigenous renewable energy sources, emphasizing the minimal carbon footprint of geothermal energy. The proposed material-coating approach aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and presents a strategic decision-making endeavor for corporations to contribute to environmental sustainability.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn February 2019, Representative Alexandria Ocasio‐Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced into the US Congress a non‐binding resolution for a Green New Deal, with the aim to catalyze policies and programs to rapidly decarbonize the US economy while achieving wider progressive economic, social and environmental goals. This motion sparked widespread interest, in and beyond the US, in the potential for more ambitious and solidaristic climate policy under the banner of a Green New Deal (GND). This Overview, after introducing the history of the GND concept and exploring its dimensions in theory, provides a snapshot of GNDs proposed (or adopted/enacted) by politicians, candidates for political office, political parties and governments around the world in the period 2019–2022. Drawing on theories of comparative politics and comparative political economy, the Overview illuminates key patterns in the prevalence and content of this set of GND proposals, as well as their ideological underpinnings and implicit “theories of change.” Specifically, it ventures that: GND policies are more commonly proposed in high‐income, industrialized democracies; variation in GNDs' prevalence and content are associated with varieties of capitalism and electoral institutions; GND policies are more commonly proposed by left‐of‐center parties and candidates; and GNDs are being proposed at all levels of government, but their content is shaped by constraints on government powers. On the basis of this analysis, the concluding section proposes a detailed research agenda on GNDs, with an emphasis on comparative research.This article is categorized under:\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Benefits of Mitigation\nPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy\nPolicy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance\n",

Grid-group cultural theory is tentatively employed to better understand these differences. Because the cosmologies identified by grid-group theory have as their basis the metaphor of the body, this is in effect a tentative anatomy of Christian responses to anthropogenic climate change. As a test case, this paper explores whether or not it is fruitful to attempt to challenge a given cosmological outlook to better communicate climate change and how this might be achieved or whether to speak to that cosmological perspective and how this might be achieved. In addition, this paper explores how each distinctive cosmology might contribute helpfully in responding to anthropogenic climate change. Finally, avenues of further work to expand this approach are explored.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe territorial impacts of climate change will affect millions. This will happen not only as a direct consequence of climate change, but also because of policies for mitigating it—for example, through the installation of large wind and solar farms, the conservation of land in its role as carbon sink, and the extraction of materials needed for renewable energy technologies. In this article, we offer an overview of the justice‐related issues that these impacts create. The literature on climate justice and territory is vast and spans a range of disciplines, so we limit our discussion to a specific understanding of territory and a specific understanding of injustice that arises from its loss. We understand territory as a normative concept that describes a place under some agent's jurisdiction, where the agent is a politically organized collective and where the jurisdictional rights over that place secure a relevant degree of self‐determination for that collective. Accordingly, we consider that the main injustice connected to the loss of territory due to climate change is the loss or undermining of the ability to exercise the collective right to self‐determination, which requires some control over the place. This can happen if a territorial agent literally loses the ground where to stand as a direct effect of climate change, raising issues of justice in relocation; or if their place changes due to mitigation policies, affecting their use and understanding of territory, raising issues of justice in energy transition. In concluding, we point to topics for future research.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\nPolicy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in Communities, Cities, and Regions\n",

Prima facie, economic, and financial developments can lower r* in scenarios with increasing climate‐related damages and uncertainty that reduce productivity growth and raise precautionary savings. Orderly climate policies have a pivotal role in facilitating the transition to a carbon‐neutral economy and supporting a steady investment flow. We discuss the main models used to simulate the effects of climate change on r* and summarize the outcomes. However, in scenarios that assume innovations and investments induced by transition policies, r* could be affected positively. Overall, the downward effects of climate change on r* can be substantial, even considering the high degree of uncertainty about the outcomes, with tipping points and nonlinear effects aggravating the economic impacts. The downward pressure on r* will further challenge monetary policy in the long run, by limiting its policy space.This article is categorized under:\nClimate Economics > Economics and Climate Change\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change\n",

This study aims to consolidate the latest interdisciplinary research in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of assessment of water quality parameters and its prediction. This research paper specifically explores the intricate relationship between climate change and water quality parameters at Sandia station, situated within the Narmada basin in Central India. As global climatic patterns continue to shift, the repercussions on water resources have gained prominence. In this work, electrical conductivity is predicted using the KERAS data processing environment on TensorFlow. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), etc. are calculated between observed and predicted values to assess the model performance. A total of ten models are developed depending upon the input geometry from past monthly timelines. The results indicate that model 8, with ten inputs, performs the best based on the R2 value of 0.889. These results indicate that AI can be very helpful in analyzing the possible threats in the future for drinking water, livestock feeding, irrigation, and so on.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSynthesizing the extensive and ever‐growing climate change literature is becoming increasingly challenging using conventional review processes, yet is crucial to understand key trends, including knowledge and policy related gaps, managing widespread impacts, and prioritizing future efforts. Here, we employ a systematic approach to interrogate ~130,000 international peer‐reviewed climate change articles published between 1990 and 2021. We examine the time–space evolution of research topics and international collaborations, providing insights into broad scale climate change research themes, how they are developed and/or are interconnected. Our analyses indicate that significant thematic adjustments have occurred over the past three decades. Whilst all major areas of climate research have grown in output metrics, there has been a relative shift from understanding the physical science basis toward evaluating climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. There has also been a significant internationalization of climate research with the ratio of international over domestic research increasing from 0.05 in 1990 to nearly 0.60 in 2021. These findings reveal a growing need for collective and coupled adaptation‐mitigation actions to address climate change. The repeatable method and overall results presented herein can help to complement existing large‐scale literature assessments, such as future IPCC reports.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change > Methods of Integrated Assessment of Climate Change\n",

        "abstract": " Agriculture is strongly affected by climate change (CC). However, its vulnerability is also determined by how farmers adapt to these long-run changes. Using an innovative approach recently proposed in the literature, this study investigates whether it is possible to find evidence of long-run adaptation in the climate-yield relationship of India’s agriculture and what the implications for future scenarios may be. District-level time series data on rice and chickpea yield are combined with weather data on cumulative growing season precipitation and growing degree days, and a quadratic regression with fixed effects augmented with climate penalty terms to account for climate adaptation is used. The estimates are utilized to extrapolate future scenarios. The estimation results suggest that rice might have some potential adaptation to precipitation, although adaptation to temperature appears to be dependent on irrigation. Chickpeas, on the other hand, adapt to temperature whereas adaptation to precipitation is limited. The findings also reveal that crop yields in projected climate scenarios are expected to respond differently depending on whether adaptation measures are implemented or not. Adaptation measures are likely to mitigate CC and reduce crop yield losses while also increasing productivity in some crops. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractOver the past decade, research on the impacts of climate change on immovable cultural heritage (ICH) in the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctica) has slowly increased. This article offers a systematic review and synthesis of the publications about climate change impacts on the diverse ICH and climate change adaptation in the polar regions. Gray literature was not included in the study. Arctic countries like Sweden, Finland, Iceland, and Russia, and their associated research organizations, are under‐represented in this literature when compared with the USA, Canada, Denmark, and Norway. More than half of the analyzed literature is published in the last 3 years (2019, 2020, and 2021) with a focus on coastal erosion and ICH degradation (cryospheric hazards). ICH is at risk from biological degradation, coastal erosion, debris flow, and thaw slumping. Nearly half of the studies report on the need for climate change adaptation planning and implementation for ICH. This study shows that advances in research on climate change impacts and adaptation responses are needed to improve decision‐ and policy‐maker capacity to support effective adaptation policies and to contribute to the achievement of SDGs in polar regions. The polar regions' vulnerable landscapes and ICH sites can be used to communicate a larger message about the climate change challenges and adaptation measures.This article is categorized under:\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Observed Impacts of Climate Change\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and Analogies\nClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well‐Being\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe polluter pays principle (PPP) has the form of a reparative principle. It holds that since some countries have historically contributed more to global warming than others, these countries have the follow‐up responsibility now to do more to address climate change. Yet in the climate justice debate, PPP is often rejected for two reasons. First, so the objection goes, it wrongly burdens present‐day individuals because the actions of their predecessors. This is the unfairness objection. The second objection is that early polluters were not aware of the harm that they were doing, and so ought not to be held culpable. This is the objection from excusable ignorance. In this commentary, I defend PPP against these two objections. The aim of this short reflection is not to provide a full justification of PPP, or to respond to all objections that have been made against it. My more limited but, I hope, important goal is to show that PPP is neither immediately unfair (in making innocent parties pay) nor immediately unreasonable (in making excusably ignorant parties pay) as is commonly noted, and is therefore worthy of further consideration as a principle of climate justice.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\n",

        "published": "2023-11",
        "citations": 1,
        "abstract": "AbstractIn the climate adaptation literature, we can distinguish two seemingly distinct frameworks for the concept of vulnerability. We might think of vulnerability in terms of susceptibility to harm. Some discussions of vulnerability accordingly focus on the risk posed to well‐being. Alternatively, we might think of vulnerability in terms of a system's responsiveness to adverse conditions, often spelled out in terms of resilience. This article highlights and distinguishes these frameworks through a brief survey of climate adaptation literature. Understanding the relationship between these two frameworks is vital not only for conceptual clarity, but also for developing adaptation strategies that respond to the different sorts of vulnerabilities posed by climate change. Mitigating the vulnerability of an individual at risk of harm might well complicate efforts at mitigating the vulnerabilities of systems in which that individual is embedded. Humans are clearly at risk of harm from a changing climate, and changing climate challenges the resilience of systems on which humans depend. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of the vulnerabilities that arise from the dissociation of people from their environments. Dissociation, whether through the migration of people or through changes to environmental background conditions not only makes clear the dual nature of vulnerabilities, but also serves as a lens through which we might consider the prospects for integrating a more cohesive account of vulnerability into successful climate adaptation strategies.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\n",

So it is not an article limited to a conventional science perspective because of course the perspective of the Earth is not documented in the literature. The author is the only climate scientist working to present the perspective on Mother Nature in the science literature, because it is part of the reality we must deal with.

        "abstract": "Climate change presents an unprecedented challenge to humanity. The changing climate threatens the very existence of humankind and the ways of life on Earth, including indigenous knowledge systems. The indigenous knowledge systems are threatened by climate change because they depend on natural factors such as trees, animals, and wind patterns, which can be affected by climate change. As the changing climate posits a significant challenge to the survival of species on earth, it begs the question ‘Are indigenous knowledge systems still relevant in a changing climate? This paper examined the African indigenous knowledge of climate change and disaster risk management in the context of the changing climate. The research was conducted in Mozambique, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tunisia, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon. The seven countries represent the six climatic zones in Africa. Africa's climate is categorised into six climate zones. These are equatorial, humid tropical, tropical, Sahelian, Mediterranean, and Desert. Following an in-depth analysis, the research found that, by contrast, the African indigenous knowledge systems and practices have evolved with the changing climate as the African indigenous communities have developed some of the advanced adaptation options to build resilience to climate change and the changing disaster risk paradigm",

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) to power and energy systems (PES) is being researched at an astounding rate, resulting in a significant number of recent additions to the literature. As the infrastructure of electric power systems evolves, so does interest in deploying ML techniques to PES. However, despite growing interest, the limited number of reported real-world applications suggests that the gap between research and practice is yet to be fully bridged. To help highlight areas where this gap could be narrowed, this article discusses the challenges and opportunities in developing and adapting ML techniques for modern electric power systems, with a particular focus on power distribution systems. These systems play a crucial role in transforming the electric power sector and accommodating emerging distributed technologies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future. The objective of this article is not to provide an exhaustive overview of the state-of-the-art in the literature, but rather to make the topic accessible to readers with an engineering or computer science background and an interest in the field of ML for PES, thereby encouraging cross-disciplinary research in this rapidly developing field. To this end, the article discusses the ways in which ML can contribute to addressing the evolving operational challenges facing power distribution systems and identifies relevant application areas that exemplify the potential for ML to make near-term contributions. At the same time, key considerations for the practical implementation of ML in power distribution systems are discussed, along with suggestions for several potential future directions.",

This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on climate change impacts on streamflow in Ethiopia, emphasizing factors driving these changes and drawing insights from relevant studies. The analysis encompasses hydrological responses to climate change, including alterations in precipitation patterns, temperature fluctuations, and changes in water availability. Additionally, the study examines the impact of land use changes on streamflow dynamics. Comparative insights from neighboring countries and river basins further illuminate the broader regional implications of climate change on water resources. According to the previous research reviewed in this paper, climate change, land use change, and increment in extreme events (drought) have affected the stream flow over the last decades. The findings underscore the urgent need for adaptive strategies and sustainable water management practices to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on streamflow and ensure water security in Ethiopia and beyond.",

At the global level, Taiwan's unique international status has limited its responses to climate change as mostly gesture policies, but recently corporate climate actions bloomed due to pressures from the supply chains. At the national level, Taiwan's developmental state legacy has locked the country in a “high‐carbon regime” and struggled with the debate on nuclear power. Finally, at the local level, Taiwan seeks to facilitate climate actions with the principle of energy democracy, yet public participation still falls short and local land use conflicts will present enormous challenges.

        "abstract": "AbstractAddressing the urgent global climate crisis demands a rapid and meaningful expansion of “climate mainstreaming,” which refers to the integration of climate objectives in all aspects of development programs and policies. However, progress remains slow and uneven due to bottlenecks in policy and institutional change. Considering the parallel struggle recorded over decades to mainstream gender across the same policy arenas, a key question emerges: what can climate mainstreaming learn from gender mainstreaming? To answer this question, we review 57 policy, strategy, and guidance documents of United Nations agencies, all of which integrate these themes into food security and broader development programming. Our analysis identifies gaps in climate mainstreaming efforts and derives lessons from gender mainstreaming to bridge these gaps. It underscores the importance of adapting programmatic mainstreaming strategies in response to evolving contexts, for example, by simultaneously considering both mainstreaming and targeted interventions. Additionally, it highlights the need to adopt organizational climate mainstreaming and establish mechanisms for accountability. Finally, it emphasizes the urgency of embracing a climate justice lens; in practice, this involves prioritizing populations at greater risk of climate change impacts and actively engaging diverse perspectives in decision‐making, particularly communities facing multiple forms of discrimination.This article is categorized under:\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change > Assessing Climate Change in the Context of Other Issues\nClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well‐Being\nPolicy and Governance > International Policy Framework\n",

Using a production function, we specified a panel data model. Estimation of the pooled model and the fixed effect model showed that both precipitation and temperature variation were negatively correlated with production for the full sample and in northern and southern Benin, indicating the robustness of the results.

The industry has imposed fossil fuel-dependent business models and behaviours on the global socioeconomic system. The actions and plans of the industry are far from being aligned with the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Agreement. Moreover, they remain overlooked in the global climate discourse and negotiations. This paper builds its arguments starting from a moral issue: climate change is an ethical failure, and the industry has had a unique role in causing, shaping, advancing, and defending the current unsustainable fossil fuel-dependent global economy, and thus bears responsibility and has duties of reparation to limit consequent harm. This paper examines the various moral principles of rectifying the unjust situation created by the actions that produced climate change. Although the Paris Agreement assigns responsibilities to states, climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies are also on the rise. This paper helps link legal frameworks and the relationship between climate justice, sustainable development, and environmental human rights to make radical, systemic changes to ensure a sustainable future.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIdeal carbon tax policy is internationally coordinated, fully internalizes externalities, redistributes revenues to those harmed, and is politically acceptable, generating predictable market signals. Since nonideal circumstances rarely allow all these conditions to be met, moral issues arise. This paper surveys some of the work in moral philosophy responding to several of these issues. First, it discusses the moral drivers for estimates of the social cost of carbon. Second, it explains how national self‐interest can block climate action and suggests international policies—carbon border tax adjustments and carbon clubs—that can help address these concerns. Third, it introduces some of the social science literature about the political acceptability of carbon taxes before addressing a couple common public concerns about carbon taxes. Finally, it introduces four carbon revenue usage options, arguing that redistributive and climate compensation measures are most morally justified.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\nClimate and Development > Social Justice and the Politics of Development\n",

        "abstract": "The agriculture sector in the Savanna region of Togo is especially vulnerable to weather fluctuations, which have an impact on crop production levels. However, farmers’ decisions to implement adaptation strategies are directly related to their perceptions of climate change risk. The current study employed a participatory workshop and household survey of 425 farmers to examine the drivers of specific climate change risks of interest (risk of loss of livelihood for farmers) and measure farmers’ level of climate change risk perception. A climate change risk perception score (CCRPS), descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, and K-means cluster analysis were used to analyze the data collected. The findings revealed that the most important changes in climate conditions affecting agricultural production in the study area were mainly the increased duration of dry spells, erratic rainfall, and an increase in extreme rainfall events. These climatic variations cause more floods and droughts, which, when coupled with socio-ecological vulnerability drivers, increase the impact of these events on agricultural livelihood, expose more farmers and their farmland, and contribute to the risk of farmers’ livelihood loss in the study area. Based on farmers’ appraisals of the occurrence of hazards, their exposure, and their vulnerability, farmers’ perceptions of climate risk have been classified into three categories: high, moderate, and low. This finding sheds some light on farmers’ climate change risk perception, which may influence their adaptation decision. These findings can be used to increase the uptake of adaptation strategies and thus the resilience of Savanna region agriculture to climate change.",

Recent international research efforts have advanced the subseasonal capabilities of operational dynamical models, yet temperature and precipitation prediction skills remain poor, partly due to stubborn errors in representing atmospheric dynamics and physics inside dynamical models. Here, to counter these errors, we introduce anadaptive bias correction(ABC) method that combines state-of-the-art dynamical forecasts with observations using machine learning. We show that, when applied to the leading subseasonal model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), ABC improves temperature forecasting skill by 60–90% (over baseline skills of 0.18–0.25) and precipitation forecasting skill by 40–69% (over baseline skills of 0.11–0.15) in the contiguous U.S. We couple these performance improvements with a practical workflow to explain ABC skill gains and identify higher-skill windows of opportunity based on specific climate conditions.",

        "abstract": "Species of Cyperaceae are little studied on the population level globally. Also in Murmansk Region, species from this family were not included in long-term population studies of rare plant species whereas other representatives from 21 families were put in [Blinova, 2009]. Experimental works with sedges is often neglected because of taxonomic difficulties and a lack of methods for study populations of this group [Kitamura et al., 2016; Sosnovska, Danylyk, 2017]. Such difficulties became obvious while the IUCN-red data book testing. Of rare sedges studied in this paper Eriophorum gracile is included in the regional Red data book [Kozhin, 2014] and Carex livida is in the Appendix of this book in the group Need of monitoring. \r\n\r\nThe Murmansk Region (6670 N), located in the north-eastern corner of Russian Fennoscandia, is a part of the Atlantic-Arctic zone of temperate belt with a rather mild climate. The region is very heterogeneous. Two latitudinal vegetation zones can be distinguished: tundra and taiga. So, many boreal plant species reach here their northern limit of distribution. Our field work has been conducted in the center part of the region in a recently found rich fen [Blinova, Petrovskij, 2014]. Both study species (Eriophorum gracile и Carex livida) have circumpolar distribution in wetlands of northern hemisphere [Hulten, Fries, 1986], and they are at the northern range in Murmansk Region [Kuzeneva, 1954; Chernov, 1954]. They are polycarpic perennials. An annual shoot has been selected as a counting unit (Fig. 1). In E. gracile only the number of generative shoots has been counted in the field. For non-destructive purposes, from herbarium data, the ratio between generative and vegetative shoots was defined as 1:1. The total population size for this species has been estimated from this ratio. In population of C. livida, the direct counting in the field has been done on 3-5 small plots (0.25*0.25 м2). Lately this value has been recalculated according to the area of population subset. Clusters and subsets have been distinguished in population structure according to suggested aggregation patterns of spatial structure in local plant populations [Blinova, 2018]. Marked population subsets have been monitored several times in the growing period in 2014-2016 years. In the field the boundaries and areas of rich fen and populations (including subsets) have been estimated with the help of GPS navigation device Garmin Dakota 20, in the lab all data are further processed using Garmin Software BaseCamp 4.2.5. Nomenclature for vascular plants is given according to S. K. Czerepanov [1995], for mosses after M. S. Ignatov  O. M. Afonina [1992]. \r\n\r\nOur results show that extremely low (0.2% for Eriophorum gracile) and relatively low (3.1% для Carex livida) population cover is characteristic for a large long-term monitored fen. Spatial aggregation of E. gracile population is structured on very small area (40 м2) whereas C. livida is established on relatively representative area (633 м2). E. gracile develops small population subsets (8 m2 on average) at a distance to next about 70 m in different parts of rich fen. Each such subset contains 9-10 mature individuals on average. C. livida has larger subsets (211 m2 on average) at 30 m away from the neighbor. The size of each subset makes c. 2500 generative shoots. The spatial population pattern of E. gracile shows isolated subsets with single clusters, whereas of C. livida represents isolated subsets with merged clusters. High fluctuations of population size and its subsets are revealed in E. gracile from year to year. The number of generative shoots and air temperature in the growing season (June-September) of the current year establish negative relationship.\r\n\r\nThis study in one of the northernmost populations of Eriophorum gracile confirms other data from different parts of its distribution area that populations of this species are very fragmented and show high fluctuations in the number of generative shoots [Barr 1996; Ksermann, Moser, 1999; Dickenmann, Keel, 2004; Decker et al., 2006; Chatters, Sanderson, 2014]. An analysis of spatial structure of populations has been pointed out that anemochory of E. gracile could be a bottleneck for the population fitness in rich fens conditions, whereas baro- and hydrochory of C. livida promotes further seed germination and survival. Additionally, current climate-changed impacts could cause an extirpation of E. gracile from floristic composition of rich fens, whereas such a threat is minimal for C. livida. Both species need regional protection of their populations. An introduction into culture is essential for further ontogenetic studies and trigger examination of clonal division of labor.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe current study reviews key social psychological mechanisms related to conflict and conflict resolution that manifest within both the coronavirus pandemic and climate change crises. The uncertainty, scale, and nature of both global crises generate various forms of individual‐ and group‐level conflicts that, mediated by psychological and cultural phenomena, impede beneficial action and sustainable adaptation. Specifically, we highlight five social psychological mechanisms (i.e., cognitive dissonance, responsibility diffusion, compassion fatigue, dehumanization, and competitive beliefs) known to interact with, produce, and amplify intrapersonal, interpersonal, and/or intergroup conflicts. We draw attention to how these mechanisms have been activated by the pandemic in ways that share important similarities with climate change and present evidence‐informed approaches to combating their contribution to conflict (i.e., motivating behavior change, implementing accountability mechanisms, creating collective action opportunities, fostering intergroup contact, and promoting perspective‐taking). By engaging social psychological research to better understand both the roots of conflict as well as outline potential individual, community, and societal responses that can help alleviate conflict during these global crises, we can increase our ability to successfully navigate and in some cases avoid future conflicts caused by climate change.This article is categorized under:\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Behavior Change and Responses\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractClimate related changes are already affecting every area of our world and will increasingly do so as global warming increases, resulting in compounding and cascading risks across multiple locations and sectors. Deliberative processes and anticipatory actions are required to adapt to the associated complex and uncertain systemic risks, with dynamic and long‐term planning needed even where there is limited knowledge of the effectiveness of adaptation. In this focus article, we examine the adaptation pathways developed for the Europe Chapter of the IPCC AR6. We argue that illustrative pathways built on quantitative and qualitative assessment of adaptation effectiveness can inform adaptation planning to manage the increasing severity of risks. We find that as the global warming level increases adaptation pathways can diverge, leading to radically different futures, for example, adaptation responses to sea level rise. We illustrate how adaptation measures for different risks interact resulting in trade‐offs, for example, increasing water scarcity. Although pathways offer a useful framework to address multiple adaptation challenges, other supporting conditions are needed for the successful implementation of adaptation, such as establishing legitimacy and buy‐in through collaboration of various actors and effective governance. Ultimately, adaptation will be increasingly more complex and constrained in a warmer world, increasing risks of losses and damages to people and nature.This article is categorized under:\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Institutions for Adaptation\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Learning from Cases and Analogies\n",

        "abstract": "The effects of climate change on agriculture are particularly noticeable due to the worldwide phenomenon of global warming. Similarly, Bhutan is also experiencing the repercussions of climate change on its agricultural sector and the livelihoods of its people. Although some researchers conducted research on climate change vulnerability on agriculture in Bhutan based on their research area and problem definition, climate change effects on paddy, maize, chilli, and cardamom in five districts (Dagana, Monger, Pemagatshel, Zhemgang, and Trongsa) have been least explored and limited. Therefore, this paper, conducted in five districts of Bhutan, analyses the trends of paddy, maize, chilli, and cardamom and the vulnerability of this variable under extreme weather. Apart from this, the effects of climate change were analyzed by comparing trends of temperature and precipitation (1901–2021). The study employed a non-probability sampling technique to conduct research and used ARIMA model to find the trends of temperature and precipitation. The results showed that there is a negative relationship as well as a positive relationship between climate change and agriculture production in the study area. Further, the study area is under threat of extreme weather, especially drought, flash flooding, windstorms, and hailstones. Additionally, results revealed that, in next decade, there is a threat of climate change, which results in a more rapid decline in paddy and maize production in all five districts. Climate adaptation policies such as climate smart agriculture (CSA) and climate smart villages (CSV) must be promoted in villages to reduce the long-term vulnerability of agriculture to climate change.",

Climate change impacts have advanced to where mitigation solutions are now required for CO2 removal from the atmosphere along with planetary albedo/ other safe geoengineering approaches in addition to ever lower cost green energy generation and energy storage/ conversion/ conservation/ efficiency. There are extensive ongoing efforts involving all of these climate mitigation approaches. This work is a survey of additional frontier technologies, concepts and alternatives not yet deployed or nascent which could greatly augment the ongoing climate mitigation efforts across the spectrum. Particularly potentially efficacious approaches wrt cost and effectiveness include Halophytes, LENR, high altitude wind, geothermal utilizing abandoned oil and gas wells, ocean fertilization, white roofs and white roads and utilization of weak force nuclear batteries to extract the some 85% of the energy still present in nuclear waste.",

        "abstract": "Climate change (CC) has a significant impact on human health, resulting in both physical and mental illnesses. Eco-anxiety—the excessive and pervasive fear about the consequences of CC—is the most studied psychoterratic state. This study presents the validation of Italian versions of Hogg’s Eco-Anxiety Scale (HEAS) and the Eco-Paralysis Scale. It also investigates the effects of worry on eco-anxiety and eco-paralysis. The study was conducted on 150 Italian individuals who responded to the two scales and to other questionnaires to make comparisons with the two above. Internal consistency and factorial structure were assessed through Cronbach’s alpha, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis. A median regression was used to assess the association between the EPS and the HEAS and Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS) and their interaction. HEAS and EPS showed good psychometric properties: HEAS resulted in good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.986), and the Eco-Paralysis scale had good test-retest reliability (r = 0.988). In both cases, a one-factor structure was suggested to be retained. The interaction terms between HEAS and CCWS (β = −0.02; 95% CI: −0.03, −0.01; p < 0.001) and between HEAS and education (β = −0.05; 95% CI: −0.08, −0.02; p < 0.001) were significant. Therefore, the feeling of worry seems to act as a moderator between climate change anxiety and eco-paralysis since it may appear to influence individuals and their ability to transform anxiety into action. Education plays a role in reducing the risk of Eco-Paralysis in subjects affected by climate change anxiety. Thus, data suggest that working on reinforcing a more cognitive concern might result in more problem-solving-focused strategies to face climate change anxiety and eco-paralysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough developed countries have been historically responsible for causing climate change, developing countries are more vulnerable to its current and future effects and being asked to commit to levels of climate action that exceed their responsibilities and capabilities. Climate change exacerbates existing social inequities by disproportionately impacting certain groups (including women, racial minorities, and the poor) more than others. Powerful institutions such as the government and the academy have a responsibility to alter this course and advance climate justice but are themselves marred by inequities. Given these disparities, the question of how the burden of climate change mitigation should be justly distributed amongst stakeholders is of paramount importance to international and domestic climate negotiations. Insights from the social identity and group processes literatures explain how experiences of inequity along geographical and sociodemographic dimensions generate identities and groups. As group members, people are sensitive to threats to the ingroup, experience collective emotions on behalf of the group, and differentially apply morality to in‐ versus outgroups. Members are also incentivized to protect and further their group's interests relative to outgroups. Social psychology offers some promising avenues of research for potential solutions to mitigate the multilevel intergroup conflict posing as a barrier to climate justice. Climate governance recommendations to policymakers and negotiators include incentivizing integrative solutions and fully considering the justice implications of climate policy. Climate scholars are encouraged to pursue interdisciplinary collaborations, improve diversity within the academy and in research samples, and prioritize climate adaptation in developing contexts.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\n",

        "abstract": "As disturbances continue to increase in magnitude and severity under climate change, there is an urgency to develop climate-informed management solutions to increase resilience and help sustain the supply of ecosystem services over the long term. Towards this goal, we used climate analog modeling combined with logic-based conditions assessments to quantify the future resource stability (FRS) under mid-century climate. Analog models were developed for nine climate projections for 1 km cells across California. For each model, resource conditions were assessed at each focal cell in comparison to the top 100 climate analog locations using fuzzy logic. Model outputs provided a measure of support for the proposition that a given resource would be stable under future climate change. Raster outputs for six ecosystem resources exhibited a high degree of spatial variability in FRS that was largely driven by biophysical gradients across the State, and cross-correlation among resources suggested similarities in resource responses to climate change. Overall, about one-third of the State exhibited low stability indicating a lack of resilience and potential for resource losses over time. Areas most vulnerable to climate change occurred at lower elevations and/or in warmer winter and summer environments, whereas high stability occurred at higher elevation, or at mid-elevations with warmer summers and cooler winters. The modeling approach offered a replicable methodology to assess future resource stability across large regions and for multiple, diverse resources. Model outputs can be readily integrated into decision support systems to guide strategic management investments.",

        "abstract": "Land as a resource remains a useful in alleviating human risks through provision of food, water, energy and environmental goods/services. There appears to be intertwined relationship between land and climate change, where climate change is perceived as a threat to land, while land and land use remains a major factor in climate change. There are however, few studies that have explored these intricate interrelationships between climate change and land as a nexus approach especially at the local levels. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring to light the interconnectedness between land and climate change and land, as well as assesses land impacts on climate change, in Kenya, and further suggests strategies needed to address these issues from a multidimensional perspective in the policy-making process. Scoping review was used to gather data from academic journal articles, book chapters, global databases, national database and conference papers. The objective of scoping reviews is to provide a broad overview of the literature on a specific topic and identify patterns, trends, knowledge clusters, and gaps. The study also obtained secondary data from various sources in the study. The study established that land-use influence climate change through agricultural expansion, urbanization, activities in catchment areas, large scale settlements, deforestation, manufacturing and industrial activities. Climate change then impact the land through reduction in agricultural activities and production, negatives on the forest ecosystems, reducing water resources, as well as detriment to quality of human, animal and plants life. The study concludes that land use change is a major driver of climate change and climate change drives land use activities in a nexus. To further this research, the study recommends ways of exploring land-sensitive approaches to climate change and land use management in a nexus a approach. The nexus approach that allows for the inter-linkages, trade-offs, and synergies existing between climate and land resources need to be developed.",

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges faced by the global community today. Impact of climate change is severe. Each degree of rise in the global mean temperature is associated with threat to life, economy and also food security. This paper reviews the literature conducted by researchers focusing on climate change and its impact on Food security. The review has shown that myriad of studies focuses on the impact of climate change on food security. The paper urges for a need to study the adaption and approaches for climate change which includes climate smart agriculture. The approaches will manage the landscapes, improve productivity, enhanced resiliency and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Ensuring food security in the face of climate change will be challenge and hence suggests the practice of sustainable agricultural practices along with climate smart agriculture.",
