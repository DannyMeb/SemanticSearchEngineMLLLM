        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change is one of the most pressing global challenges we face today. The impacts of rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are already being felt around the world and are only expected to worsen in the coming years. To mitigate and adapt to these impacts, we need innovative, data-driven solutions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for climate change adaptation, offering a range of capabilities that can help identify vulnerable areas, simulate future climate scenarios, and assess risks and opportunities for businesses and infrastructure. With the ability to analyze large volumes of data from climate models, satellite imagery, and other sources, AI can provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making and help us prepare for the impacts of climate change. However, the use of AI in climate change adaptation also raises important ethical considerations and potential biases that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and deploy these solutions, it is crucial to ensure that they are transparent, fair, and equitable. In this context, this article explores the latest innovations and future directions in AI-enabled climate change adaptation strategies, highlighting both the potential benefits and the ethical considerations that must be considered. By harnessing the power of AI for climate change adaptation, we can work towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThose concerned with climate governance will want to keep watching what is happening in AI governance. Far from unrelated, the two parallel one another in terms of how fractions of capital—whether within fossil fuel or tech sectors—call for legislating in the face of crisis or for voluntary pledges. In truth, both may be said to be forms of self‐governance. Climate and AI intersect firstly in how they are imagined: dominant climate and AI discourses are both symptoms of Anthropocene thinking and ‘capitalist realism’. They also intersect in as much as ‘AI for Good’ initiatives propose that AI is ethical because it can help to address climate change. What seems missing, however, is any consideration of this climate AI as a procedure—is its knowledge valid, what knowledges does it displace or exclude, what biases are reproduced?—and consideration for its consequences, including harms. Does it actually result in climate mitigation and/or adaptation in a given context? What ‘maladaptive’ outcomes might it drive? What alternatives does it foreclose? These sorts of questions are ones where geographers will continue to have a lot to say.",

We call for an intersectional and decolonial approach to better understand how disabilities intersect with social and structural injustices in urban settings to shape diverse responses to climate change and disasters. We highlight the economic, socio‐cultural, and embodied challenges that increase vulnerability to—and ability to recover from—disasters including urban flooding and earthquakes. We draw on ethnographic and visual data from our research, including a comic illustrated by Ariel and Zaldi and sketches by Rizaldi, to centre diverse lived experiences of structural vulnerabilities and socio‐cultural marginalisation, particularly concerning education and livelihoods. Foregrounding life stories in this way serves to challenge the absence of meaningful engagement of people with disabilities in disaster risk reduction and climate change actions and decision‐making. Our article highlights disability as a site of both discrimination and critical embodied knowledge, simultaneously a product of structural, socio‐cultural, political, and environmental injustice while also a source of innovation, resilience, and agency.",

        "abstract": "This study addresses a notable gap in the climate change literature by examining the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI–ML) in urban climate change adaptation and sustainable development across major global continents. While much attention has been given to mitigation strategies, this study uniquely delves into the AI–ML’s underexplored role in catalyzing climate change adaptation in contemporary and future urban centers. The research thoroughly explores diverse case studies from Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North America, and South America, utilizing a methodological framework involving six-step and five-step models for systematic literature reviews. The findings underscore AI–ML achievements, illuminate challenges, and emphasize the need for context-specific and collaborative approaches. The findings imply that a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient. Instead, successful adaptation strategies must be intricately linked to the particular characteristics, vulnerabilities, and intricacies of each region. Furthermore, the research underscores the importance of international collaboration, knowledge sharing, and technology transfer to expedite the integration of AI–ML into climate adaptation strategies globally. The study envisions a promising trajectory for AI–ML in the climate adaptation domain, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing research, innovation, and practical AI–ML applications. As climate change remains a defining challenge, this research predicts an increasingly pivotal role for AI–ML in constructing climate-resilient urban centers and promoting sustainable development. Continuous efforts to advance AI–ML technologies, establish robust policy frameworks, and ensure universal access are crucial for harnessing AI–ML’s transformative capabilities to combat climate change consequences.",

        "citations": 8,
        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change can be construed as a question of collective responsibility from two different viewpoints: climate change being inherently a collective problem, or collective entities bearing responsibility for climate change. When discussing collective responsibility for climate change, “collective” can thus refer to the problem of climate change itself, or to the entity causing the harm and/or bearing responsibility for it. The first viewpoint focuses on how climate change is a harm that has been caused collectively.Collective action problemrefers to an aggregation of individual actions which together produce an outcome that is not intended at the level of an individual action. It cannot be solved by any one agent acting unilaterally. Instead, climate change action must be enacted and supported by numerous agents. The second way to conceptualize climate change as a question of collective responsibility focuses on the collective entities that bear responsibility for climate change. As a global problem, climate change is linked to the realm of international politics, where states, governments, and intergovernmental organizations are the main collective entities. Other important agential collectives in terms of climate responsibility are corporations, including carbon majors who have produced the bulk of emissions. Climate change has also been theorized as astructural injustice, which combines elements from both the viewpoints on what is collective about responsibility for climate change.This article is categorized under:Climate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate ChangeClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere is increasing public debate about the governance of climate change and its repercussions for nature and human livelihoods. In today's digitalized communication landscape, both public and private actors involved in climate change governance use social media to provide information and to interact with stakeholders and the broader public. This Focus Article discusses two main aspects of debates about climate change and climate governance on Twitter, which previous theories suggest to shape climate governance across domestic and global levels: non‐state climate action and public opinion formation on the social media. We see significant advancement in the environmental social sciences studying these two areas. Yet, we also see the need for a better understanding of how public and private actors in the climate governance complex interact on Twitter, and how these actors shape, and are shaped by, experiences, values, and positions. This understanding will help to advance climate governance theories. This article proceeds in three steps. We first discuss previous social media research on non‐state climate action and public opinion formation related to climate change and its governance. Then we sketch avenues for future research, elaborating how Twitter data might be used to investigate how non‐state climate action and public opinion formation on social media are linked to and influence climate governance. We conclude by making the case for drawing together Twitter data and climate governance research into a more coherent research agenda.This article is categorized under:\nPolicy and Governance > Private Governance of Climate Change\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Communication\nPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy\nPolicy and Governance > Multilevel and Transnational Climate Change Governance\n",

        "abstract": "The impact of global warming on the environment is a significant concern, and finding effective ways to address climate change is a priority. This paper investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be utilised to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support efforts to combat climate change, with a particular focus on the chemical industry. The study presents a theoretical framework and comparative analysis of both technological and non-technological solutions to achieve net-zero GHG emissions and establish a carbon-neutral status in the chemical industry. The aim is to assess the potential role of AI as a tool for reducing CO2 emissions from the chemical industry and contributing to the global goal of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions. The analysis will evaluate the efficacy of AI as a tool in reducing GHG emissions in the chemical industry and explore its potential for optimising processes, predicting and reducing emissions, and supporting the development of sustainable practices. By utilising AI, it may be possible to identify and implement effective solutions that may not have been possible through conventional methods. Ultimately, the study aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to address climate change by highlighting the potential of AI as a tool for reducing GHG emissions in the chemical industry.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article presents a new interpretive framework for understanding the implications of climate change for migration, and reviews and reflects on existing evidence and research gaps in light of this framework. Most existing climate‐migration research is heavily environment‐centric, even when acknowledging the importance of contextual or intervening factors. In contrast, the framework proposed here considers five different pathways through which climate change is affecting, or might affect, migration: short‐term shocks, long‐term climatic and related changes, environmental “pull” factors, climate adaptation and mitigation measures, and perceptions and narratives. In reviewing the existing evidence relating to each of these pathways, the paper finds among other things that short‐term shocks may simultaneously increase and reduce migration; that the evidence on long‐term trends provides a weak basis for understanding future dynamics; and that more attention needs to be paid to the other three pathways, by researchers and policymakers alike. Overall, the proposed framework and associated evidence review suggest a different and broader understanding of the migration implications of climate change from that outlined in the IPCC's most recent assessment, or in many existing reviews.This article is categorized under:\nClimate and Development Knowledge and Action in Development\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThough it is often said that climate change is a risk to people's well‐being, the specific ways in which it affects people's well‐being is still poorly understood, especially as it relates to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. Two interrelated issues contribute to this gap in knowledge: (1) the use of different conceptualizations of well‐being across disciplines; and (2) the limited use of local and context‐specific understandings of well‐being that are meaningful to people exposed to climate change. Here, we review 103 articles covering the topic of climate change adaptation and well‐being. We find that, despite the growing interest on the topic, most of the articles do not include definitions of well‐being. We then propose an approach informed by emic values to better understand how climate change may affect well‐being in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities. We conclude that, given the increasing recognition of well‐being as a fundamental marker of successful adaptation, well‐being should be central to climate change research and policymaking, but for this to be of benefit to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities context‐specific understandings of well‐being are necessary.This article is categorized under:\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\nClimate and Development > Sustainability and Human Well‐Being\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge\n",

This advanced review offers a critical overview of the key themes of this literature with the primary intention of enabling historians and other scholars to recognize, specify, and acknowledge the roles of imperial and colonial processes in shaping scientific framings of climate. Following a brief overview of debates in older literature over the significance of imperialism and colonialism in climate sciences, the article investigates the wealth of recent scholarship that demonstrates specific and diverse connections between empires and climate science. Major features of this scholarship include: the role and the erasure of Indigenous and local knowledge; imperial climate infrastructures and visions; and climate data and theories in land empires as well as in informal empires and neocolonial settings. Through critically engaging these themes, the article seeks to help historians identify avenues for future research.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > World Historical Perspectives\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Global Climate Change are two developments that will come to define the twenty‐first century. As such, examining their intersections is crucial and can yield important insights. Geography is well positioned to study these intersections through its diverse conceptual and methodological toolkit, which bridges the physical and environmental science, the social sciences and the humanities, as well as the human and more‐than‐human worlds. A first step in deploying a geographic analysis can be to ground the links between AI and Global Climate Change in concrete geographic contexts. I illustrate this exercise in the paragraphs that follow and identify its productive potential. Specifically, this text deploys a geographic perspective grounded in political economy to connect concerns about the data and energy inequalities embedded in various AI applications while showing how such inequalities are intertwined both with the monitoring of Global Climate Change and with its material impacts.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMany now argue that we should think about the previously unthinkable risks of climate change, including societal collapses and human extinction. Calamitous images of the future are not pathological or counterproductive: it is both necessary and valuable to imagine the worst‐case scenarios of climate change. Critics of climate catastrophe often group together all visions of disastrous futures under labels like doomism or pessimism. This is unhelpful and greater nuance is required. We need to distinguish between climate doomists (who see catastrophe as imminent and unavoidable) and climate risk realists (who see catastrophe as one potential future that should be avoided). We also need to split apart the different ways of envisioning climate catastrophe to understand their distinct strengths and weaknesses. We outline and compare three alternative modes of viewing the worst‐case scenarios of climate change: foresight, agitation, and fiction. The first centers on modeling catastrophic climate scenarios, the second on the use of images of climate catastrophe for political action, and the third on fictional visions of future climate disasters. These different approaches are complementary and should be better integrated to create more comprehensive models of the future. All of them would benefit from viewing the future as uncertain, reflecting on the social position of the author, and guarding against the authoritarian “stomp reflex” that can be induced by discussions of crisis and emergency.This article is categorized under:\nAssessing Impacts of Climate Change > Evaluating Future Impacts of Climate Change\nPerceptions, Behavior, and Communication of Climate Change > Perceptions of Climate Change\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\n",

Descriptive data were obtained on different aspects of psychological distance such as temporal, social, geographical and uncertainty. The study also evaluated the relationship between contact with nature through climate change and climate denial. The research is a descriptive study. Climate change denial scale and nature contact scales were used to measure the levels of climate change denial and contact with nature. Data were collected online from 123 people living in different geographical regions of Turkey. Group comparison findings based on individuals' assessments of their political views (left/right) are consistent with the literature. Significant differences in denial of climate change were observed among groups separated by political views. In addition, a significant relationship was found between age and denial of climate change. Our findings are important in terms of revealing some social and cognitive factors in the perception of the climate change problem in our country and helping to develop more effective strategies in combating climate change.",

        "abstract": "AbstractClimate activism, and ethical reflection on it, is expanding in line with increased awareness of global warming's destructive effects. The ethics of climate activism has focused on two main questions. First, is there a duty to engage in climate activism? Answers to this question differ regarding how the duty is grounded, how demanding it is, and whether people in certain social roles have special duties to engage in climate activism. The second question is whether certain forms of climate activism are morally permissible, given certain frequently voiced concerns. Prominently, concerns about climate activism being ineffective, uninclusive, undemocratic, and violent.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe uncertainty in the climate projection arising from various climate models is very common, and averaging such results poses a risk of underestimation or sometimes overestimation of impact in magnitude and frequency. Further, the performance of various climate models in monsoon degrades drastically due to the skewed nature. Under these circumstances, the performance of the climate model in the monsoon and non-monsoon periods is critical for accurate assessment. A multimodal approach has been used in the present work to quantify the uncertainty involved in the climate model using reliability ensemble averaging (REA). Based on AR6 of IPCC, the ensemble of 26 global climate models (GCMs) was used to evaluate the model performance and possible change in seasonal precipitation in four cities with distinct climate conditions, namely, Coimbatore, Rajkot, Udaipur, and Siliguri. The results show that non-monsoon and monsoon rainfall are expected to increase in all the regions. Most of the models perform poorly in simulating monsoon climate, especially in the monsoon period and are highly inconsistent spatially. The study also finds that the model performance is largely linked to the ratio of natural variability and mean.",

        "abstract": "AbstractClimate change is arguably the most severe threat faced by humanity today. In an attempt to understand how humanity can manage this phenomenon for planetary health, it is fundamental to have an understanding of what it is. This aligns with a critical gap in the extant literature, that is, how different perceptions of climate change among facilitators of learning (in this case, academics) can enable the establishment of a framework of critical consciousness that could boost climate change education and contribute to climate change management. To this end, the study that underpins this paper set out to capture the perceptions of climate change among a selection of academics at a local university in Cameroon. Following a comprehensive analysis of the data, different views on the subject emerged, aligning with scientific, observational, and cultural definitions. Drawing on theoretical insights into critical consciousness, the findings of this study have wider implications for climate change education at universities. A framework is suggested to support educators as they foster critical thinking among learners, as this can facilitate their ability and the wider community to make informed decisions on mitigation and adaptation strategies in light of climate change and the threats it carries.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGlobally, cultural heritage is on the front line of anthropogenic climate change. Therefore, it could be argued that climate change should now be a primary lens through which cultural heritage conservation and management are viewed. We argue that addressing the growing and compounding risks and impacts of climate change requires a fundamental rethink and transformation of cultural heritage management and policy. In this article, we propose a climate‐smart cultural heritage (CSCH) approach that captures the notion that climate adaptation can be developed and implemented within the heritage sector to simultaneously reduce the impacts of changing climate and variability on tangible and intangible cultural heritage and provide co‐benefits for climate change mitigation while also enhancing human security at different spatial scales. The CSCH is an integrated approach to implementing forward‐looking and transformative cultural heritage management and policy and is not a new set of practices to be advocated to cultural heritage stakeholders and decision‐makers. Findings also demonstrate that institutional mechanisms such as multi‐stakeholder planning, increased awareness of the economic, social, and environmental benefits of diverse cultural heritage, improved cross‐sectoral coordination and communication, strong political will for transformative approaches, and investments in CSCH are necessary for implementation of CSCH.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Disciplinary Perspectives\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Climate Science and Decision Making\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change > Assessing Climate Change in the Context of Other Issues\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractMaterial efficiency (ME), making products with less material or substituting with less carbon‐intensive material without a loss of functionality, can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and complement other strategies to mitigate climate change. Seven ME strategies for cars and homes in the G7 countries were recently modeled in a study by the International Resource Panel. Modeling indicates that ME strategies focusing on construction and use of homes could lower the overall cumulative emissions in the G7 between 2016 and 2060 by 8.5 Gt CO2e (20%), while ME strategies for the production and use of cars could reduce up to 12 Gt (24%). For both homes and cars, the strategy of more intensive use—where fewer or smaller products are required to provide the same basic service—showed the greatest potential. A review of existing ME policies reveals that attention to ME in climate policy has been limited. Policy toward ME has historically focused on waste management rather than GHG reduction. Ex post evaluation of policies that do exist, especially for recycling and related waste strategies, is infrequent. Framing efficient use of materials as a measure primarily intended for climate mitigation is relatively recent and uncommon. Production‐related policy opportunities have been neglected because using ME to reduce GHGs is novel in some sectors and because increased ME faces economic and social barriers. Rebound effects where reduction of the cost of housing or transportation can increase material consumption offsetting potential gains, a problem for all efficiency‐based approaches, is understudied and not currently addressed through policy.This article is categorized under:\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Policies, Instruments, Lifestyles, Behavior\nThe Carbon Economy and Climate Mitigation > Decarbonizing Energy and/or Reducing Demand\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhile climate change adaptation research has increasingly focused on aspects of culture, a systematic treatment of the role of legal culture in how communities respond to climate risk has yet to be produced. This is despite the fact that law and legal authority are implicated in most, if not all, of the ways in which actors seek to reduce the risks posed to communities by climate change. Using a scoping review methodology, this article examines the intersection of climate change adaptation and legal culture in existing research. Overall, we find that the significance of legal culture for adaptation actions has been under‐explored. Yet, it is also clear that a focus on legal culture holds significant promise for our understanding of climate change adaptation. We set out a research agenda for the field, highlighting the ways in which a focus on legal culture may enrich existing key themes within climate change adaptation research.This article is categorized under:\nPolicy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in Communities, Cities, and Regions\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Institutions for Adaptation\n",

Their analysis suggests that these emotions can be categorised by their stimuli into those related to the classroom: activities, outcomes, relationships, topics and knowledge processes (epistemic). Most research in this area has focused on achievement emotions, with relatively limited research exploring topic emotions. This paper develops a framework for conceptualising topic emotions. It reports on a design‐based study that captured children's expressions of emotion in response to a climate change education programme using picturebooks. The data brought together emotional responses to climate change, to learning about climate change and to climate‐related picturebooks. Qualitative analysis of these responses highlights how they differ not only with regard to the emotions expressed, but also the structure of the emotional experience. Emotional responses to the broad topic of climate change were expressed as ongoing analytical judgements, where those related to learning about climate change were immersive and finite. Reading climate‐related picturebooks involved exploring how emotion is communicated and evoked. This supported quasi‐emotional experiences, where the reader imagines the emotions of the characters. The picturebooks are also shown to create vicarious emotional experiences, involving ethical‐based responses to the behaviour and circumstances depicted. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a framework for disaggregating these differing emotional experiences related to topic.",

In this overview, I survey the main lenses through which various actors have linked climate justice and reproductive justice in the United States. First, I review the literatures: on climate justice, the perspective that those who are least responsible for the conditions causing climate change are disproportionately impacted by it; and on the reproductive justice, which focuses on rejecting reproductive oppression to achieve comprehensive reproductive autonomy for individuals and communities. Next, I analyze frameworks that seek to reframe reproductive justice through a populationist, climate‐centered lens. I contrast these framings with new approaches focused on racial health disparities and intergenerational justice. The article ends with questions about the next directions in climate justice and reproductive justice linkages: in particular, the role of eco‐anxiety in shaping reproductive futures. In so doing, I argue for approaches that challenge mainstream framings focused on population size and growth, and instead foreground the embodied reproductive outcomes of climate‐impacted communities.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Ethics and Climate Change\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\nVulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values‐Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation\n",

The primary objective is to enhance the heat resistance capabilities of materials crucial for geothermal energy extraction, a key renewable energy source with minimal carbon footprint. Presently, Iceland leads in global geothermal energy production, emphasizing the significance of optimizing extraction methods. Previous research faced challenges due to suboptimal material selection, hindering drilling to greater depths. This study proposes a novel solution—employing innovative material coatings on drilling bits and pipes, utilizing metallic compounds with exceptional heat resistance properties. The coating strategy involves leaving pipes uncoated up to a depth where they naturally withstand heat, with subsequent application for greater depths. This approach promises cost-effective materials capable of enduring extreme conditions in geothermal drilling, fostering higher drilling depths and cost efficiency. Implementation projections suggest significant facilitation of geothermal energy extraction, particularly in abandoned wells near tectonic plate boundaries, reducing extraction costs. The study underscores the societal benefits of tapping into indigenous renewable energy sources, emphasizing the minimal carbon footprint of geothermal energy. The proposed material-coating approach aligns with global efforts to combat climate change and presents a strategic decision-making endeavor for corporations to contribute to environmental sustainability.",

        "abstract": "The article examines the impact of climate change on the territory of Kazakhstan and its consequences for ecosystems, agriculture, economy and public health. Thecurrent climate change trends in Kazakhstan were analyzed using data from hydrometeorological observations at stations and posts of the state observation network of RSE «Kazhydromet». Climate norms and variable anomalies are considered, and changes in climate characteristics for the period 1976-2022 are estimated using linear trend coefficients and the coefficient of determination. The author focuses on the analysis of current climate change trends in the region and possible strategies for adaptation to them.",

        "abstract": "In climate change mitigation, the building sector is assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC). The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) is a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change, including the physical science basis, impacts, adaptation, and mitigation. The IPCC-AR6 emphasizes that the building sector is critical during 2020-2030 to avoid lock-in CO2 emissions. However, readily available, and highly cost-effective actions that can be undertaken now to reduce CO2 emissions in the building sector are identified. The sufficiency, efficiency, and renewable (SER) measures must be really designed and effectively implemented to decarbonize the building sector before 2050. The IPCC affirms that we can still secure a safe and livable future if actions are taken now.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis pilot study addresses the differences in responses to anthropogenic climate change expressed in published normative statements for a cross section of Christian denominations and groupings from the UK and USA as well as international groupings. Grid-group cultural theory is tentatively employed to better understand these differences. Because the cosmologies identified by grid-group theory have as their basis the metaphor of the body, this is in effect a tentative anatomy of Christian responses to anthropogenic climate change. As a test case, this paper explores whether or not it is fruitful to attempt to challenge a given cosmological outlook to better communicate climate change and how this might be achieved or whether to speak to that cosmological perspective and how this might be achieved. In addition, this paper explores how each distinctive cosmology might contribute helpfully in responding to anthropogenic climate change. Finally, avenues of further work to expand this approach are explored.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe territorial impacts of climate change will affect millions. This will happen not only as a direct consequence of climate change, but also because of policies for mitigating it—for example, through the installation of large wind and solar farms, the conservation of land in its role as carbon sink, and the extraction of materials needed for renewable energy technologies. In this article, we offer an overview of the justice‐related issues that these impacts create. The literature on climate justice and territory is vast and spans a range of disciplines, so we limit our discussion to a specific understanding of territory and a specific understanding of injustice that arises from its loss. We understand territory as a normative concept that describes a place under some agent's jurisdiction, where the agent is a politically organized collective and where the jurisdictional rights over that place secure a relevant degree of self‐determination for that collective. Accordingly, we consider that the main injustice connected to the loss of territory due to climate change is the loss or undermining of the ability to exercise the collective right to self‐determination, which requires some control over the place. This can happen if a territorial agent literally loses the ground where to stand as a direct effect of climate change, raising issues of justice in relocation; or if their place changes due to mitigation policies, affecting their use and understanding of territory, raising issues of justice in energy transition. In concluding, we point to topics for future research.This article is categorized under:\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Global Justice\nClimate, Nature, and Ethics > Climate Change and Human Rights\nPolicy and Governance > Governing Climate Change in Communities, Cities, and Regions\n",
