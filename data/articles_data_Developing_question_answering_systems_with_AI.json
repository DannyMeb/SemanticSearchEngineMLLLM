        "abstract": "AbstractConsumers are increasingly using the web to find answers to their health‐related queries. Unfortunately, they often struggle with formulating the questions, further compounded by the burden of having to traverse long documents returned by the search engine to look for reliable answers. To ease these burdens for users, automated consumer health question answering systems try to simulate a human professional by refining the queries and giving the most pertinent answers. This article surveys state‐of‐the‐art approaches, resources, and evaluation methods used for automatic consumer health question answering. We summarize the main achievements in the research community and industry, discuss their strengths and limitations, and finally come up with recommendations to further improve these systems in terms of quality, engagement, and human‐likeness.",

        "abstract": "Chatbots are programs with the ability to understand and respond to natural language in a way that is both informative and engaging. This study explored the current trends of using transformers and transfer learning techniques on Arabic chatbots. The proposed methods used various transformers and semantic embedding models from AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, AraElectra-SQuAD, and AraElectra (Generator/Discriminator). Two datasets were used for the evaluation: one with 398 questions, and the other with 1395 questions and 365,568 documents sourced from Arabic Wikipedia. Extensive experimental works were conducted, evaluating both manually crafted questions and the entire set of questions by using confidence and similarity metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that combining the power of transformer architecture with extractive chatbots can provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to questions in Arabic. Specifically, our experimental results showed that the AraElectra-SQuAD model consistently outperformed other models. It achieved an average confidence score of 0.6422 and an average similarity score of 0.9773 on the first dataset, and an average confidence score of 0.6658 and similarity score of 0.9660 on the second dataset. The study concludes that the AraElectra-SQuAD showed remarkable performance, high confidence, and robustness, which highlights its potential for practical applications in natural language processing tasks for Arabic chatbots. The study suggests that the language transformers can be further enhanced and used for various tasks, such as specialized chatbots, virtual assistants, and information retrieval systems for Arabic-speaking users.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge is essential for understanding. The ongoing explosion of information highlights the need for electronic texts that allow machines to better understand human language. The explosion of information in various fields has greatly changed our lives. Among them, the information explosion of the film is particularly prominent. Nowadays, people's requirements for high quality of spiritual life are increasing, and people's demand for movies is also increasing. With the extensive coverage of the Internet, the amount of movie-related information is also increasing, so how to design and build a question-and-answer system about movies is more and more urgent and important. At the same time, the original intention of the knowledge graph is to express various entities, concepts that exist objectively in the real world, and various relationships between them. It can better understand the abstract components in the language, and better to confirm the information through the interaction of the ambiguous parts of the language. In addition, the upgrade of deep learning natural language processing technology allows us to better understand and analyse language. In view of the above advantages, the movie question answering system in this paper is constructed based on the knowledge graph and uses natural language processing technology.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nExtractive question-answering (EQA) is a useful natural language processing (NLP) application for answering patient-specific questions by locating answers in their clinical notes. Realistic clinical EQA can yield multiple answers to a single question and multiple focus points in 1 question, which are lacking in existing data sets for the development of artificial intelligence solutions.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to create a data set for developing and evaluating clinical EQA systems that can handle natural multianswer and multifocus questions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe leveraged the annotated relations from the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges corpus to generate an EQA data set. Specifically, the 1-to-N, M-to-1, and M-to-N drug-reason relations were included to form the multianswer and multifocus question-answering entries, which represent more complex and natural challenges in addition to the basic 1-drug-1-reason cases. A baseline solution was developed and tested on the data set.\n\n\nResults\nThe derived RxWhyQA data set contains 96,939 QA entries. Among the answerable questions, 25% of them require multiple answers, and 2% of them ask about multiple drugs within 1 question. Frequent cues were observed around the answers in the text, and 90% of the drug and reason terms occurred within the same or an adjacent sentence. The baseline EQA solution achieved a best F1-score of 0.72 on the entire data set, and on specific subsets, it was 0.93 for the unanswerable questions, 0.48 for single-drug questions versus 0.60 for multidrug questions, and 0.54 for the single-answer questions versus 0.43 for multianswer questions.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe RxWhyQA data set can be used to train and evaluate systems that need to handle multianswer and multifocus questions. Specifically, multianswer EQA appears to be challenging and therefore warrants more investment in research. We created and shared a clinical EQA data set with multianswer and multifocus questions that would channel future research efforts toward more realistic scenarios.\n",

Covid-19 pandemic, student services with a remote model related to this question and answer become very important. To carry out this automation process, the advanced cosine similarity method is used to check the similarity of the questions to the database and statistics to calculate the similarity value of each word. The proposed paper proceeds with three phases. The first stage to solve this problem is the data processed in question; the professional next step is word insertion. It converts alphanumeric words to vector format. Each word is a vector that represents a point in space with a certain dimension. The recommended advanced cosine similarity data still must be analyzed into a statistical approach. We will measure accuracy to get results so that optimal results and answers are obtained, research procedures are carried out based on literature study, initial data collection and observation, system development, system testing, system analysis, and system evaluation. This research implemented in universities with student chat automation applications providing an accuracy 83.90% given by natural language question answering system (NLQAS) so that it can improve excellent service in universities.</span>",

        "abstract": "The purpose of knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) is to accurately answer the questions raised by users through knowledge triples. Traditional Chinese KBQA methods rely heavily on artificial features, resulting in unsatisfactory QA results. To solve the above problems, this paper divides Chinese KBQA into two parts: entity extraction and attribute mapping. In the entity extraction stage, the improved Bi-LSTM-CNN-CRF model is used to identify the entity of questions and the Levenshtein distance method is used to resolve the entity link error. In the attribute mapping stage, according to the characteristics of questions and candidate attributes, the MGBA-LSTM-CNN model is proposed to encode questions and candidate attributes from the semantic level and word level, respectively, and splice them into new semantic vectors. Finally, the cosine distance is used to measure the similarity of the two vectors to find candidate attributes most similar to questions. The experimental results show that the system achieves good results in the Chinese question and answer data set.",

KBQA provides instant tutoring for learners, improving their learning interest and efficiency. However, most open domain KBQA methods model question sentences and candidate answer entities independently, limiting their effectiveness. The proposed method extracts description information and query entity sets for a specific question, processes them with Transformer and pre-trained embeddings of the knowledge base, and extracts a subgraph of candidate answer sets from the knowledge base. The node information is updated by GCN with two attention mechanisms expressed by the question description and query entity set, respectively. The query description information, query entity set, and candidate entity representation are fused to calculate the score and predict the answer. Experiments on MOOC Q&A dataset show that the proposed method outperforms benchmark models.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe effectiveness of natural language processing models relies on various factors, including the architecture, number of parameters, data used during training, and the tasks they were trained on. Recent studies indicate that models pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned on task-specific datasets, covering multiple tasks, can generate remarkable results across various benchmarks. We propose a new approach based on a straightforward hypothesis: improving model performance on a target task by considering other artificial tasks defined on the same training dataset. By doing so, the model can gain further insights into the training dataset and attain a greater understanding, improving efficiency on the target task. This approach differs from others that consider multiple pre-existing tasks on different datasets. We validate this hypothesis by focusing on the problem of answering yes/no questions and introducing a multi-task model that outputs a span of the reference text, serving as evidence for answering the question. The task of span extraction is an artificial one, designed to benefit the performance of the model answering yes/no questions. We acquire weak supervision for these spans, by using a pre-trained extractive question answering model, dispensing the need for costly human annotation. Our experiments, using modern transformer-based language models, demonstrate that this method outperforms the standard approach of training models to answer yes/no questions. Although the primary objective was to enhance the performance of the model in answering yes/no questions, it was discovered that span texts are a significant source of information. These spans, derived from the question reference texts, provided valuable insights for the users to better comprehend the answers to the questions. The model’s improved accuracy in answering yes/no questions, coupled with the supplementary information provided by the span texts, led to a more comprehensive and informative user experience.",

        "abstract": "There are many questions answering (QA) system built for solving QA tasks. In 2020 and 2022, Allen Institute and the University of Washington proposed UnifiedQA and UnifiedQA-v2. Their core concept is that the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities required by models are common, and may not require format specific models although the QA task forms are different. Behind this concept, I build a new QA model named SPQA, aiming to answer the situation puzzle questions by adding new situation-puzzle related dataset (SpQ). In addition, I evaluate the performance of SPQA and UnifiedQA-v2 for fine-tuning and prompt-tuning. The results of fine-tuning indicate that SpQ dataset is important for fine-tuning and prompt-tuning to answer situation puzzle questions well, but also make the answering ability of normal yes/no questions worse. Eventually, the results of prompt-tuning indicate that the effects of SpQ is larger and more significant on situation puzzle questions and normal yes/no questions under the same data scale. In the future work, the further research like building larger SpQ dataset should be considered.",

Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA) allows people to ask questions in natural language and extract answers from KG accurately and more quickly. The main task of a KGQA is to convert a natural language query to the corresponding structured query form like SPARQL. However, generating the precise SPARQL query from a question is challenging and highly error‐prone. Here we propose a question‐answering framework that uses KG to answer simple questions without using SPARQL. Question classification, dependency parsing, entity linking, BERT‐based relation finding and answer extraction constitute the main modules of the approach. We have used the DBpedia as the KG and tested the end‐to‐end system with a subset of QALD‐4, LC‐QuAD and SimpleQuestions datasets. Results show considerable improvement compared to other approaches in terms of F1‐score.",

        "abstract": "The question-answering system (QAS) aims to produce a response to a query using information from a text corpus. Arabic is a complex language. However, it has more than 450 million native speakers across the globe. The Saudi Arabian government encourages organizations to automate their routine activities to provide adequate services to their stakeholders. The performance of current Arabic QASs is limited to the specific domain. An effective QAS retrieves relevant responses from structured and unstructured data based on the user query. Many QAS studies categorized QASs according to factors, including user queries, dataset characteristics, and the nature of the responses. A more comprehensive examination of QASs is required to improve the QAS development according to the present QAS requirements. The current literature presents the features and classifications of the Arabic QAS. There is a lack of studies to report the techniques of Arabic QAS development. Thus, this study suggests a systematic literature review of strategies for developing Arabic QAS. A total of 617 articles were collected, and 40 papers were included in the proposed review. The outcome reveals the importance of the dataset and the deep learning techniques used to improve the performance of the QAS. The existing systems depend on supervised learning methods that lower QAS performance. In addition, the recent development of machine learning techniques encourages researchers to develop unsupervised QAS.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, are artificial intelligence models designed to analyse vast data and generate coherent outputs, changing the way healthcare professionals access knowledge. Critically, LLMs also present incorrect information confidently, a phenomenon known as hallucination, which is particularly dangerous in the safety-critical field of medicine. The validity of LLM responses to medical queries are being explored generally, however, responses to surgical questions remain poorly quantified. Variations between specialties are important to identify to support strategic LLM improvements.\n\n\nMethods\nWe assessed accuracy of GPT-3 and GPT-4 in answering surgical multi-choice questions from the MedMCQA post-graduate question bank. We calculated the percentage accuracy of GPT-4 on all surgical questions (n=23025) and compared this to published GPT-4 performance across the whole MedMCQA dataset. We also analysed variations in performance by topic on a randomised sample of questions manually sorted by surgical specialty (n=1000).\n\n\nResults\nAccuracy rates for GPT-3 and GPT-4 were 53% and 64% respectively, demonstrating significant superiority of GPT-4, however GPT-4's surgical performance remained weaker than its overall MedMCQA performance. Notably, accuracy varied significantly by specialty, with strong performances in anatomy, vascular and paediatric surgery but below-average performances in orthopaedics, ENT and neurosurgery.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study holds significant implications for the expanding use of LLMs in surgery, especially education. GPT has improved accuracy with sequential developments, however, its performance requires further scrutiny. We recommend ongoing attention on factors underpinning subject-variation in performance to aid strategic LLM innovation.\n",

        "abstract": "Due to the rapid growth of knowledge graphs (KG) as representational learning methods in recent years, question-answering approaches have received increasing attention from academia and industry. Question-answering systems use knowledge graphs to organize, navigate, search and connect knowledge entities. Managing such systems requires a thorough understanding of the underlying graph-oriented structures and, at the same time, an appropriate query language, such as SPARQL, to access relevant data. Natural language interfaces are needed to enable non-technical users to query ever more complex data. The paper proposes a question-answering approach to support end users in querying graph-oriented knowledge bases. The system pipeline is composed of two main modules: one is dedicated to translating a natural language query submitted by the user into a triple of the form <subject, predicate, object>, while the second module implements knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, exploiting the previous module triple and retrieving the answer to the question. Our framework delivers a fast OpenIE-based knowledge extraction system and a graph-based answer prediction model for question-answering tasks. The system was designed by leveraging existing tools to accomplish a simple prototype for fast experimentation, especially across different knowledge domains, with the added benefit of reducing development time and costs. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system, which provides promising performance, as assessed at the module level. In particular, in some cases, the system outperforms the literature. Finally, a use case example shows the KG generated by user questions in a graphical interface provided by an ad-hoc designed web application.",

Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more  adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-A-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe a generative question answering system which relies on text or knowledge graphs to find supporting evidence. The goal of generative QA is to provide a natural full sentence answer relying on the relevant evidence. Unlike existing models, the system proposed here can generate full answers using knowledge base triplets as evidence and is not restricted to simple questions consisting of one triplet. The generation module is a pretrained encoder-decoder transformer. Additionally, we constructed a new dataset DSberQuAD to train and evaluate the generative QA system in Russian. The new dataset was constructed in a rule-based manner and is an extension of SberQuAD with full sentence answers for each question. The proposed model is a new SOTA for Russian KBQA on RuBQ2.0 dataset. All the code and data from this project are be available on GitHub 1 under Apache license.",

Due to the continuous improvement of relevant large-scale standard data sets, a large number of visual questions answering research results have been released one after another, and the accuracy rate of the visual question answering model based on deep learning on the data set has been continuously improved. Recent studies have found that the previously proposed visual question answering model has different degrees of data set language prior problems, that is, the model is overly dependent on the strong phase between the question and the answer in the training process. Many articles briefly describe various research methods, and look forward to the future development direction of alleviating the prior problem of visual question answering based on the existing research.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-based question-answering (QA) systems can expedite the performance of various tasks. These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language’s complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur’an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system.",

        "abstract": "\n            Question-answering systems are recognized as popular and frequently effective means of information seeking on the web. In such systems, information seekers can receive a concise response to their queries by presenting their questions in natural language. Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of\n            question answering\n            and\n            dialogue systems\n            . On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically.\n          \nThis survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature. It begins by explaining the foundational principles of question-answering systems, hence defining new notations and taxonomies to combine all identified works inside a unified framework. The reviewed published work on interactive question-answering systems is then presented and examined in terms of its proposed methodology, evaluation approaches, and dataset/application domain. We also describe trends surrounding specific tasks and issues raised by the community, so shedding light on the future interests of scholars. Our work is further supported by a GitHub page synthesising all the major topics covered in this literature study. https://sisinflab.github.io/interactive-question-answering-systems-survey/",

We propose a semi-automatic approach for transforming a natural language question into a SPARQL query that can be easily processed over a knowledge base. The approach applies classification techniques to associate a natural language question with a proper query template from a set of predefined templates. The nature of our approach is semi-automatic as the query templates are manually written by human assessors, who are the experts of the knowledge bases, whereas the classification and query processing steps are completely automatic. Our experiments on the large-scale CSQA dataset for question-answering corroborate the effectiveness of our approach.\n",

        "abstract": "Dense passage retrieval is a popular method in information retrieval recently, especially in open domain question answering. It aims to retrieve related articles from massive passages to answer the question. Retriever can increase retrieval speed with less loss of accuracy compared to other methods. However, the pretrained language models used in recent research are often ineffective in semantic embedding, which will reduce accuracy. In addition, we find that contrastive learning will diverge the representation space, and Siamese models with independent parameters on both sides will decrease generalization performance. Therefore, we propose span prompt dense passage retrieval (SPDPR) based on span mask prompt tuning and parameter sharing in Chinese open-domain dense retrieval. This model can generate more efficient representation embeddings and effectively counteract the separation tendency between positive samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of SPDPR in DYKzh, as well as two Chinese datasets. SPDPR surpasses all SOTAs implemented in DYKzh and achieves a competitive result in other datasets.",

        "abstract": "The complexity of relationships between bridge inspection presents a significant challenge for the answer system. Sparse knowledge graph (KG) due to limited triples further compounds the issue. To overcome this, this paper proposes a dynamic reasoning strategy for bridge inspection question answering. The framework comprises a teacher-student network and dynamic reasoning strategy. The teacher network, based on the neural state machine (NSM), acquires auxiliary intermediate supervision signals. Its output provides probability distribution and entity embedding as input for the student network. The student network, also NSM-based, provides accurate answers with the aid of intermediate supervision signals. To handle incomplete KG, the dynamic reasoning strategy incorporates knowledge embedding, updating the KG by capturing contextual information of each related entity node in relation to the question. Experiments on the bridge inspection dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, outperforming other approaches.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA growing awareness of bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems has recently emerged, leading to an increased number of publications discussing ethics in AI. Nevertheless, the specific issue of gender bias remains under-discussed. How can design contribute to preventing the emergence of gender bias in AI-driven systems? To answer this question, we investigated the current state of AI ethical guidelines within the European Union. The results revealed that most guidelines do not acknowledge gender bias but address discrimination. This raised our concerns, as addressing multiple biases simultaneously might not effectively mitigate any of them due to their often-unconscious nature. Furthermore, our results revealed a lack of quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of bias prevention implementation methods and solutions. In conclusion, based on our analysis, we propose four recommendations for designing effective guidelines to tackle gender biases in AI. Moreover, we stress the central role of diversity in embedding the gender perspective from the beginning in any design activity.",

Finally, the attention mechanism is used to improve the attention of some words and the accuracy of personalized course recommendation. The experiment shows that when the recommended list is 35, the precision, recall, and F1 value of the proposed personalized course recommendation method are 0.862, 0.851, and 0.857, respectively, which are higher than those of the comparison method.

While studied in tasks such as sentiment analysis and reading comprehension, it remains unexplored in open-domain question answering (OpenQA) due to the difficulty of collecting perturbed questions that satisfy factuality requirements. In this work, we collect minimally edited questions as challenging contrast sets to evaluate OpenQA models. Our collection approach combines both human annotation and large language model generation. We find that the widely used dense passage retriever (DPR) performs poorly on our contrast sets, despite fitting the training set well and performing competitively on standard test sets. To address this issue, we introduce a simple and effective query-side contrastive loss with the aid of data augmentation to improve DPR training. Our experiments on the contrast sets demonstrate that DPR’s contrast consistency is improved without sacrificing its accuracy on the standard test sets.1",

        "abstract": "Hybrid tabular-textual question answering (QA) is a crucial task in natural language processing that involves reasoning and locating answers from various information sources, primarily through numerical reasoning and span extraction. Cur-rent techniques in numerical reasoning often rely on autoregressive models to decode program sequences. However, these methods suffer from exposure bias and error propagation, which can significantly decrease the accuracy of program generation as the decoding process unfolds. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multitasking hybrid tabular-textual question answering (MHTTQA) framework. Instead of generating operators and operands step by step, this framework can independently generate entire program tuples in parallel. This innovative approach solves the problem of error propagation and greatly improves the speed of program generation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments using the ConvFinQA and MultiHiertt datasets. Our proposed model outperforms the strong FinQANet baselines by 7% and 7.2% Exe/Prog Acc and the MT2Net baselines by 20.9% and 9.4% EM/F1. In addition, the program generation rate of our method far exceeds that of the baseline method. Additionally, our non-autoregressive program generation method exhibits greater resilience to an increasing number of numerical reasoning steps, further highlighting the advantages of our proposed framework in the field of hybrid tabular-textual QA.",

        "abstract": "Reading Comprehension models have achieved superhuman performance on mainstream public datasets. However, many studies have shown that the models are likely to take advantage of biases in the datasets, which makes it difficult to efficiently reasoning when generalizing to out-of-distribution datasets with non-directional bias, resulting in serious accuracy loss. Therefore, this paper proposes a pre-trained language model based de-biasing framework with positional generalization and hierarchical combination. In this work, generalized positional embedding is proposed to replace the original word embedding to initially weaken the over-dependence of the model on answer distribution information. Secondly, in order to make up for the influence of regularization randomness on training stability, KL divergence term is introduced into the loss function to constrain the distribution difference between the two sub models. Finally, a hierarchical combination method is used to obtain classification outputs that fuse text features from different encoding layers, so as to comprehensively consider the semantic features at the multidimensional level. Experimental results show that PLM-PGHC helps learn a more robust QA model and effectively restores the F1 value on the biased distribution from 37.51% to 81.78%.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our biomedical document retrieval system and answers extraction module, which is part of the biomedical question answering system. Approximately 26.5 million PubMed articles are indexed as a corpus with the Apache Lucene text search engine. Our proposed system consists of three parts. The first part is the question analysis module, which analyzes the question and enriches it with biomedical concepts related to its wording. The second part of the system is the document retrieval module. In this step, the proposed system is tested using different information retrieval models, like the Vector Space Model, Okapi BM25, and Query Likelihood. The third part is the document re-ranking module, which is responsible for re-arranging the documents retrieved in the previous step. For this study, we tested our proposed system with 6B training questions from the BioASQ challenge task. We obtained the best MAP score on the document retrieval phase when we used Query Likelihood with the Dirichlet Smoothing model. We used the sequential dependence model at the re-rank phase, but this model produced a worse MAP score than the previous phase. In similarity calculation, we included the Named Entity Recognition (NER), UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI), and UMLS Semantic Types of the words in the question to find the sentences containing the answer. Using this approach, we observed a performance enhancement of roughly 25% for the top 20 outcomes, surpassing another method employed in this study, which relies solely on textual similarity.",

        "abstract": "Understanding multiple modalities and relating them is an easy task for humans. But for machines, this is a stimulating task. One such multi-modal reasoning task is Visual question answering which demands the machine to produce an answer for the natural language query asked based on the given image. Although plenty of work is done in this field, there is still a challenge of improving the answer prediction ability of the model and breaching human accuracy. A novel model for answering image-based questions based on a transformer has been proposed. The proposed model is a fully Transformer-based architecture that utilizes the power of a transformer for extracting language features as well as for performing joint understanding of question and image features. The proposed VQA model utilizes F-RCNN for image feature extraction. The retrieved language features and object-level image features are fed to a decoder inspired by the Bi-Directional Encoder Representation Transformer - BERT architecture that learns jointly the image characteristics directed by the question characteristics and rich representations of the image features are obtained. Extensive experimentation has been carried out to observe the effect of various hyperparameters on the performance of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the model’s ability to predict the answer increases with the increase in the number of layers in the transformer’s encoder and decoder. The proposed model improves upon the previous models and is highly scalable due to the introduction of the BERT. Our best model reports 72.31% accuracy on the test-standard split of the VQAv2 dataset.",

        "abstract": " Knowledge graph question answering aims to answer natural language questions using structured knowledge graph data. The key to achieving this is having a correct semantic understanding of the question phrases. Query graph generation is an important step for knowledge graph question answering systems to tackle complex questions. Unlike simple single-hop questions, complex questions often require reasoning between multiple triples to get the right answer due to multiple entities, relationships and constraints, making it difficult to generate correct query graphs. In previous studies, researchers have primarily focused on improving the extraction and representation of question features, neglecting the prior structural information implicated in the question itself. In this paper, we propose a question structure classifier to classify the question structure, and alleviate the noise interference in query graph through classification results. In the classifier, we strengthen the information about the question structure through the attention mechanism, while weakening the irrelevant information. Moreover, a query graph sorting module based on feature cross-coding is proposed to sort candidate paths in the query graph using fine-grained feature interaction between words. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets (MetaQA and WebQuestionsSP) and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines.",

        "abstract": "Textual Question Answering targets answering questions defined in natural language. Question Answering Systems offer an automated approach to procuring answers to queries expressed in natural language. The need for Multilingual Question Answering without performing machine translation is ever existing. Besides that, automating tasks with the help of technology to assist humans, has been the main aim of research in recent years. This paper presents an automated answer evaluation system for reading comprehension-based questions in the Hindi language without requiring translation in any other language. The system accepts text, question, and handwritten answer of a student in the form of an image for answer evaluation. This is accomplished by developing a textual question-answering system for reading comprehension. It is an extractive approach that utilizes RoBERTa transformer model and fine-tunes it for Hindi question-answering. The answer to the question is extracted as a span from the provided text. Further, a handwritten text recognizer model is developed employing a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network with Connectionist Temporal Classification module along with two layers of Bidirectional LSTM. Experimentation is performed using existing as well as self-created datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. An accuracy of 98.69% is obtained on the self-created Hindi-QA dataset and the proposed system outperformed the other existing methods. The paper also discusses potential research directions in the field.",

The existing VQA solutions either focus only on improving the joint multi-modal embedding or on the fine-tuning of visual understanding through attention. This research, in contrast to the current trend, investigates the feasibility of an object-assisted language understanding strategy titled semantic object ranking (SOR) framework for VQA. The proposed system refines the natural language question representation with the help of detected visual objects. For multi-CNN image representation, the system employs canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The suggested model is assessed using accuracy and WUPS measures on the DAQUAR dataset. On the DAQUAR dataset, the analytical outcomes reveal that the presented system outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by a significant factor. In addition to the quantitative analysis, proper illustrations are supplied to observe the reasons for performance improvement.",

        "abstract": "Many models that leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in question answering (QA) tasks. In the real world, many facts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has received increasing attention. Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models in temporal KGQA, they still have several limitations. (I) They adopt  pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend to focus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporal constraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations of entities. (II) They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities nor explicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make it difficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling (QC-MHM) network. Specifically, We first calibrate the question representation by fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG. Then, we construct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing. Finally, the question representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN to generate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmark dataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestions dataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% compared to the best-performing baseline.  Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretable and trustworthy predictions.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention, but the definition of “large” lacks clarity. This paper focuses on medium-sized language models (MLMs), defined as having at least six billion parameters but less than 100 billion. The study evaluates MLMs regarding zero-shot generative question answering, which requires models to provide elaborate answers without external document retrieval. The paper introduces an own test dataset and presents results from human evaluation. Results show that combining the best answers from different MLMs yielded an overall correct answer rate of 82.7% which is better than the 60.9% of ChatGPT. The best MLM achieved 71.8% and has 33B parameters, which highlights the importance of using appropriate training data for fine-tuning rather than solely relying on the number of parameters. More finegrained feedback should be used to further improve the quality of answers. The open source community is quickly closing the gap to the best commercial models.",

Users all over the internet ask tons of questions to which they want precise answers. The Question Answering system is the best solution in such scenarios. Traditional approach mainly focuses on providing the documents which include the keywords related to the query asked by the users. While the question answering approach provides a better alternative by further refining the results, it not only returns the related documents but also retrieves the most relevant answer from the available corpus of data. Converting the questions asked by the users into an appropriate query string, classifying the question, retrieving the documents and extracting the valid answer are the main steps involved in this system.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nThe regulatory affairs (RA) division in a pharmaceutical establishment is the point of contact between regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies. They are delegated the crucial and strenuous task of extracting and summarizing relevant information in the most meticulous manner from various search systems. An artificial intelligence (AI)–based intelligent search system that can significantly bring down the manual efforts in the existing processes of the RA department while maintaining and improving the quality of final outcomes is desirable. We proposed a “frequently asked questions” component and its utility in an AI-based intelligent search system in this paper. The scenario is further complicated by the lack of publicly available relevant data sets in the RA domain to train the machine learning models that can facilitate cognitive search systems for regulatory authorities.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this study, we aimed to use AI-based intelligent computational models to automatically recognize semantically similar question pairs in the RA domain and evaluate the Recognizing Question Entailment–based system.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used transfer learning techniques and experimented with transformer-based models pretrained on corpora collected from different resources, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Clinical BERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT. We used a manually labeled data set that contained 150 question pairs in the pharmaceutical regulatory domain to evaluate the performance of our model.\n\n\nResults\nThe Clinical BERT model performed better than other domain-specific BERT-based models in identifying question similarity from the RA domain. The BERT model had the best ability to learn domain-specific knowledge with transfer learning, which reached the best performance when fine-tuned with sufficient clinical domain question pairs. The top-performing model achieved an accuracy of 90.66% on the test set.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrates the possibility of using pretrained language models to recognize question similarity in the pharmaceutical regulatory domain. Transformer-based models that are pretrained on clinical notes perform better than models pretrained on biomedical text in recognizing the question’s semantic similarity in this domain. We also discuss the challenges of using data augmentation techniques to address the lack of relevant data in this domain. The results of our experiment indicated that increasing the number of training samples using back translation and entity replacement did not enhance the model’s performance. This lack of improvement may be attributed to the intricate and specialized nature of texts in the regulatory domain. Our work provides the foundation for further studies that apply state-of-the-art linguistic models to regulatory documents in the pharmaceutical industry.\n",

        "abstract": "This thesis is positioned at the intersection of several research fields, Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval (IR) and Computer Vision, which have unified around representation learning and pre-training methods. We have defined and studied a new multimodal task: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities (KVQAE). We were particularly interested in cross-modal interactions and different ways of representing named entities. We also focused on data used to train and, more importantly, evaluate Question Answering systems through different metrics. We annotated a dataset for this purpose, the first in KVQAE comprising various types of entities. We also defined an experimental framework for dealing with KVQAE in two stages through an unstructured knowledge base and identified IR as the main bottleneck of KVQAE, especially for questions about non-person entities. To improve the IR stage, we studied different multimodal fusion methods, which are pre-trained through an original task: the Multimodal Inverse Cloze Task. We found that these models leveraged a cross-modal interaction that we had not originally considered, and which may address the heterogeneity of visual representations of named entities. These results were strengthened by a study of the CLIP model, which allows this cross-modal interaction to be modeled directly.\n\nAwarded by\n            : Université Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France on 8 November 2023.\n          \n\nSupervised by\n            : Olivier Ferret and Camille Guinaudeau.\n          \n\nAvailable at\n            : https://www.theses.fr/s247993.\n          ",
