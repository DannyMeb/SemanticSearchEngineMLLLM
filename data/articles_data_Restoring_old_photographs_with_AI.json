        "abstract": "Private and family photographs are our most personal images taken at significant events of our lives. We used to put these photos into albums or just kept them in boxes without specific orders, and we only opened up these personal archives when we wanted to share our memories and stories with family members or close friends. These common habits regarding how we take and share private photos have changed a lot due to the digital turn, the increasing number of digital cameras, and the broadening usage of the Internet and social media platforms. Archives are often places of safeguarding memories, places that make us remember and places of preservation. However, in recent years, the questions related to them and the archiving methods are mostly focused on how digitization has transformed them. The varying ways and effects of technical image usage caused by the technological boom are some of the most characteristic and defining elements of our times. In my paper titled Our Photographs, Old and New, I examine — through a contemporary artwork by Gergely Barcza — how private photography practices and private photo archives have changed in the last decades.",

        "abstract": "Academic publishing has entered an era of fake, including fake authors who are either real entities using fake credentials, or totally concocted personalities that give the impression of real humans. Both can be achieved via the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and software that is capable of completing such a task, and ultimately a deepfake is created. The creation of fictitious deepfakes, even more so when assisted or driven by AI, allows creators to not only establish a fake image or photo, but also embed it within a fake context (e.g., profile). For whatever reason, there are risk of deepfakes during manuscript submission and the publication process, as well as on academic social network sites, like ResearchGate, but are academics, journals and publishers sufficiently prepared to detect them?.",

However, there are few dedicated tools or resources available to aid researchers in this largely manual task. In this paper, we propose BackTrace, a human-AI collaboration system that employs a three-step workflow to retrieve and organize historical photos with similar backdrops. BackTrace is a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system powered by deep learning that allows for the iterative refinement of search results via user feedback. We evaluated BackTrace with mixed-methods evaluation and found that it successfully aided users in finding photos with similar backdrops and grouping them into collections. Finally, we discuss how our findings can be applied to other domains, as well as implications of deploying BackTrace as a crowdsourcing system.",

        "abstract": "Older people have difficulty controlling infection with common viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), RNA virus which causes recurrent infections due to a high rate of genetic mutation, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV), DNA virus which persists in B cells for life in the 95% of people that become acutely infected. We questioned whether changes in epitope-specific memory CD8 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires to these two common viruses could occur with increasing age and contribute to waning immunity. We compared CD8 memory TCR alpha and beta repertoires in two HLA-A2+ EBV- and IAV-immune donors, young (Y) and older (O) donors to three immunodominant epitopes known to be cross-reactive, IAV-M158-66 (IAV-M1), EBV-BMLF1280-288 (EBV-BM), and EBV-BRLF1109-117 (EBV-BR). We, therefore, also designed these studies to examine if TCR cross-reactivity could contribute to changes in repertoire with increasing age. TCR high throughput sequencing showed a significant difference in the pattern of TRBV usage between Y and O. However, there were many more differences in AV and AJ usage, between the age groups suggesting that changes in TCRα usage may play a greater role in evolution of the TCR repertoire emphasizing the importance of studying TRAV repertoires. With increasing age there was a preferential retention of TCR for all three epitopes with features in their complementarity-determining region (CDR3) that increased their ease of generation, and their cross-reactive potential. Young and older donors differed in the patterns of AV/AJ and BV/BJ pairings and usage of dominant CDR3 motifs specific to all three epitopes. Both young and older donors had cross-reactive responses between these 3 epitopes, which were unique and differed from the cognate responses having features that suggested they could interact with either ligand. There was an increased tendency for the classic IAV-M1 specific clone BV19-IRSS-JB2.7/AV27-CAGGGSQGNLIF-AJ42 to appear among the cross-reactive clones, suggesting that the dominance of this clone may relate to its cross-reactivity with EBV. These results suggest that although young and older donors retain classic TCR features for each epitope their repertoires are gradually changing with age, maintaining TCRs that are cross-reactive between these two common human viruses, one with recurrent infections and the other a persistent virus which frequently reactivates.",

        "abstract": "To address the challenge of sparse old photo datasets, we apply transfer learning to image inpainting tasks. Specifically, we improve a two-stage image inpainting network that focuses on collaborative subtasks. We also design a transform module based on the cross-aggregation of windows to improve long-distance contextual information acquisition in image inpainting and enhance the integrity of images in terms of structure and texture. Our improved two-stage network has a significantly better repair performance compared to that of the current common inpainting methods. We further apply transfer learning techniques by utilizing the improved two-stage image inpainting network as the base network and decoupling the generator into a feature extractor and classifier, which consist of an encoder and a decoder, respectively. We obtain a domain-invariant feature extractor through minimax game training using source and target domain data. This feature extractor can be combined with the original encoder to restore old photo images. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted comparative experiments. Our results show that the PSNR, SSIM, and FID indexes of the model using transfer learning are 11.8%, 2.96%, and 44.4% higher than those without transfer learning, respectively. These findings suggest that applying transfer learning techniques can be an effective solution to address the challenge of sparse old photo datasets in image inpainting tasks.",

        "abstract": "Urban sprawl or expansion is a growing issue globally, and as technology continues to develop, the demand for residential areas continues to rise. Conflicts regarding the availability of resources for architecture also rise in rural areas; therefore, renovating old buildings in urban centers becomes an important concept. Since there are many challenges with renovating these buildings, the recent development of AI technologies will provide solutions to mitigate or reduce these challenges. This paper examines the application of AI technologies in architecture and how they contribute to redeveloping old buildings in urban areas. Technologies such as conditional Generative Adversarial Networks and deep neural networks can assist architects in standardizing floor plans and generating design modules. In addition, these technologies analyze data from existing buildings and, thus, can create the best possible plan for a building. While these technologies focus on simplifying the traditional process of architectural planning in areas such as generating programs and creating partitions, B-SMART reference architecture approaches architecture from the perspective of smart home building, therefore, implementing AI technologies into the lives of the residents. Furthermore, with AI technologies, future homes are created to be energy efficient and sustainable. Therefore, the application of AI will improve the sustainability of homes and overall benefit the environment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Measuring the area of skin involvement in chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) relies on costly, time-consuming manual assessment, with high disagreement among experts (>20%). Our published AI method, trained on labeled 3D photos, showed promise for delineating affected areas. We aim to improve its performance using unlabeled 2D photos. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Our published AI model (baseline) was trained on 360 labeled photos of 36 cGVHD patients,from a 3D camera with calibrated distance and lighting.Our gold standard labels were contours around affected skin, marked by a trained expert. A second unlabeledcohort of 974 standard 2D photos of 8 cGVHD patients was used to improve the baseline model. First the baseline model predicted affected areas on the unlabeled photos. Photos with good predictions were added to the training set with their AI-predicted labels. The model was then re-trained with the expanded labeled set. Models were successively trained with more AI labels until performance stopped improving. AI performance was assessed on a test set of 20 photos from 20 patients unseen during training, labeled by 4 experts to improve accuracy. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Model performance was calculated by comparing against the gold standard labels on the test set. To quantify the spatial overlap of labeled areas the Dice coefficient was used (0 is no overlap, 1 is complete agreement), where higher values are better. To estimate clinical error we used surface area error (Error), where lower values are better. On the test set, the baseline model had a median Dice of 0.57 [interquartile range: 0.39 – 0.82] and Error of 57.6% [20.2 – 103.3%]. Re-training with additional AI-predicted labels from 8 new patients, the model yielded a median Dice of 0.60 [0.35 – 0.80] and Error of 50% [12.5 – 103.8%]. This approach is being expanded to a further 300 unlabeled patients, where we anticipate significant improvements to AI performance and consistency. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluating AI models in standard photos could provide a consistent method of assessing and tracking cutaneous cGVHD and relieve the burden of costly expert assessment. A reliable automated AI tool would provide a meaningful improvement to the current standard of manual assessment and could be easily applied to large patient cohorts.",

        "abstract": "Forensic odontology is a relatively new branch in the field of dentistry that has opened a new horizon for many dentists. With a surge of crime rates and lawsuits in the world, the need for specialists to help in identification of post mortem remains has increased. The reason for forensic odontology as an up-and-coming field in recent times is because teeth and the surrounding orofacial structures, similar to fingerprints, are unique features and can be used for definitive identification. This uniqueness can be attributed to variations in morphology, size and different treatment history of every individual. Teeth are a good source of data for post mortem studies as they are durable structures and are able to resist decomposition. For this reason, forensic odontology has become a promising field in recent times. Materials used to restore teeth have also shown durability in adverse conditions and increase the variations that can help in identification as restorations can be considered as unique features. The aim of this review article is to describe the various ways restorative materials can aid in identification of individuals.",

Climate change, deforestation, and rapid urbanization highlight the urgent need for all-encompassing policies that not only address ecological degradation but also promote a strong bond between people and the natural world. The study sought to understand how individuals' personal spiritual beliefs influenced their understanding of and commitment to ecological regeneration and rewilding. This was done in order to better understand the complex relationship that exists between spirituality and ecological regeneration, as expressed in the research title, \"Rewilding our Hearts, Restoring our Land: Spiritual Perspectives on Ecological Regeneration.\" Deep Ecology provides a theoretical framework for examining the spiritual aspects of ecological regeneration. It permits an in-depth investigation of the ways in which people, guided by their spiritual convictions, can embrace ecocentric principles and support rewilding initiatives. This study conducted a thorough investigation of the complex relationship between spirituality and ecological regeneration using a qualitative research methodology. As part of the research methodology, participant observations with members of various spiritual communities were used to collect qualitative data. As a result, study has revealed the subtle facets of participants' lived experiences, beliefs, and practices that influence their relationships to the environment through in-depth interviews and participant observations within various spiritual communities. The participants demonstrated a commitment to responsible environmental stewardship and a heightened awareness of ecological interconnectedness, driven by their spiritual perspectives.",

Preserved uniquely in Berlin, Former Preußische Staatsbibliothek, Ms. Mus. 40634 (now in Kraków, Biblioteka Jagiellońska), only two of the original partbooks remain, leaving the discantus and tenor parts to be supplied in their entirety. The work, begun with the late Philip Weller, has been completed with the assistance of Paul Kolb. I consider the specific challenges it has entailed and its implications for the practice of restoring fragmentary polyphonies, with reference to two sections, which pose very different challenges. In particular, the statements of the Italian monophonic tune that serves as the work’s model have had to be identified. Often this has been straightforward, but in a few cases it has been less so. I also attempt to draw a few general conclusions about the process of restoration. The restorer’s principal focus is attentiveness to the implications of the extant material. Obrecht’s compositional practice might be described as a ‘game of consequences’, which means that the clues in the extant voices are perhaps especially plentiful and suggestive.",

However, advancement of these methods for dietary assessment in research settings has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate dataset against which to benchmark algorithm performance. We conducted the Surveying Nutrient Assessment with Photographs of Meals (SNAPMe) study (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT05008653) to pair meal photographs with traditional food records. Participants were recruited nationally, and 110 enrollment meetings were completed via web-based video conferencing. Participants uploaded and annotated their meal photos using a mobile phone app called Bitesnap and completed food records using the Automated Self-Administered 24-h Dietary Assessment Tool (ASA24®) version 2020. Participants included photos before and after eating non-packaged and multi-serving packaged meals, as well as photos of the front and ingredient labels for single-serving packaged foods. The SNAPMe Database (DB) contains 3311 unique food photos linked with 275 ASA24 food records from 95 participants who photographed all foods consumed and recorded food records in parallel for up to 3 study days each. The use of the SNAPMe DB to evaluate ingredient prediction demonstrated that the publicly available algorithms FB Inverse Cooking and Im2Recipe performed poorly, especially for single-ingredient foods and beverages. Correlations between nutrient estimates common to the Bitesnap and ASA24 dietary assessment tools indicated a range in predictive capacity across nutrients (cholesterol, adjusted R2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001; food folate, adjusted R2 = 0.21, p < 0.05). SNAPMe DB is a publicly available benchmark for photo-based dietary assessment in nutrition research.

        "abstract": "Synthetic chemicals are widely used in agriculture mainly as fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals were initially considered highly beneficial for crops and relatively harmless to humans and the environment. Experience, however, has shown that many have time-limited effectiveness, yet cause persisting biological disruptions. They are also an added cost amounting to approximately $130 billion annually. Nature has a limited capacity to adapt to changed conditions, including the cultivation of large monocultures and the presence of unnatural chemicals. These adaptations are referred to as Nature’s allostasis. In addition to requiring time, allostasis depends on there being sufficient life force energy. KELEA is an acronym for Kinetic Energy Limiting Electrostatic Attraction. It functions as a major life force energy, which can be conveyed in KELEA activated water. Various means are available to increase the KELEA level of groundwater and in turn that of growing crops. A low-cost approach to KELEA activation of water is provided by using pellets of volcanic rock materials that have been pulverized and heated before pelleting. Relatively few commercially available pellets, marketed as Kiko Technology, greatly increase the production of rice. Further, when used in conjunction with biochar, the pellets markedly reduce the levels of pollution in water, some of which would normally flow into land used for agriculture. The effects are attributed to KELEA Assisted Restoration of Nature’s Allostasis (KARNA). Without apparent adverse e",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nStudy question\nIs there a difference in AI performance in predicting blastulation between young and old mice?\n\n\nSummary answer\nAI performance in predicting blastulation is higher in young mice than in old mice.\n\n\nWhat is known already\nPrevious studies have demonstrated AI's ability to predict oocyte development using oocyte or embryo images, but there has been no study to determine if AI performance varies with the age of the female. Maternal age influences oocyte quality and development, but other factors such as diet and environment also play a role. Using mouse experiments can minimize these confounding factors. The study aims to determine if there is a difference in AI performance for predicting blastulation using oocyte images from old and young mice.\n\n\nStudy design, size, duration\nWe collected oocyte images from 673 B6D2F1 (BDF1) mice at a single research center between July 2022 and January 2023. The samples were separated into two groups based on maternal age, 386 from young mice and 287 from old mice. The development stages including fertilization and blastulation were recorded through daily observation, and the data was divided into a training set of 3 batches and a test set of 2 batches.\n\n\nParticipants/materials, setting, methods\nThe mice were divided into two groups: young mice (7-9 weeks old) and old mice (62-68 weeks old). The study used images of MII oocytes collected after superovulation, taken with a 200x inverted microscope, and cultured in a single drop. A CNN was trained to predict blastulation and compared for accuracy between the young and old mouse groups. Blastulation was determined by observing the presence of expanded blastocysts or above on day 4.\n\n\nMain results and the role of chance\nThe study used 203 and 182 oocyte images of young and old mice respectively for training, and 183 and 105 images for testing. Three convolutional neural network models (VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) were used to predict blastulation, and ResNet50 was selected as the final model. Without considering age, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI for predicting blastulation were 0.75, 0.74, and 0.76, respectively. The AI model used in the study had accuracy of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.79 in the young mice group. In the old mice group, the model had accuracy of 0.72, sensitivity of 0.70, and specificity of 0.74. When a t-test was performed, there was a statistically significant difference in accuracy (p = 0.014) with better accuracy in young mice. On the contrary, the sensitivity in the old mice group was the lowest, making it difficult to predict blastulation. As oocyte morphology does not always represent aneuploidy, the AI model using oocyte images may not perform well in the old mice group due to increased aneuploidy.\n\n\nLimitations, reasons for caution\nThe limitations of this study include its retrospective design using oocyte images from only one research center. A larger, multicenter study would be beneficial.\n\n\nWider implications of the findings\nThe study found that AI accurately predicted blastulation using mice oocyte images, with higher accuracy for both positive and negative outcomes in young mice. However, accuracy was lower in old mice, particularly for positive outcome, suggesting the need for additional tests like genetic testing for predicting blastulation in old mice.\n\n\nTrial registration number\nnot applicable\n",

        "abstract": "Spice farming in Zanzibar has been integral to the country’s culture, history and economy but in recent decades, Zanzibar’s role in the global spice trade has diminished as declining market prices and government interference have pushed many farmers to convert spice forests into monoculture farms. Community Forests International (CFI) and Community Forests Pemba (CFP) have been working since 2015 to re-establish these diverse agroforest ecosystems and restore farmers’ livelihoods. Unlike monoculture farming, spice forests offer better economic incentives, ecological sustainability, and equality for women, and have the potential to restore a resilient spice-farming economy that is ecologically and socially sustainable. By revitalising local and indigenous knowledge, including from Tanzania, agroforestry practices are being implemented by small-scale Zanzibari farmers to grow a mix of timber, fruit and spice tree crops. This has enabled farmers to improve their household nutrition, increase their crop yields and diversify their income streams, ensuring energy, food and income security. The use of agroforestry practices in spice forests has also promoted structural and ecological diversity, regenerated soil health, enhanced carbon stores, and ensured resilience against climate change. Stories of individual farmers, Saidi Khalifa and Kibano Omar Kibano, exemplify how landscapes and lives can be positively transformed when spice forests are restored to replace monoculture farms with training and support from CFP. The story of Bimajo Masoud Juma also exemplifies how CFP has promoted agroforestry to empower women to have an independently earned income, ensuring their economic independence. CFP is also working with farmers to create stronger cooperative models that would enable them to sell directly to international buyers. The global organic spice market is expanding, so farmers involved in these sustainable and organic agroforestry practices are well-positioned to thrive.",

        "abstract": "Aims: This study aim was to evaluate the impact of multiple sclerosis on bowel and bladder function and its consequences for socialization and sexual function in MS patients. Additionally, it sought to investigate potential variations in these effects among different MS subtypes.\n\nMethodology: A total of 780 participants were internationally recruited, with a predominant representation from the United States. Participants completed self-reported surveys assessing bowel and bladder function, and their MS subtype (relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, or secondary progressive) was documented.\n\nResults: Findings indicated that most respondents reported occasional issues with bowel and bladder function. Notably, individuals with primary progressive and secondary progressive MS demonstrated a higher prevalence of bowel and bladder difficulties compared to those with relapsing-remitting MS.\n\nScientific Novelty: This study offers new insights by highlighting the distinct impact of MS subtypes on bowel and bladder function. It underscores the importance of understanding how MS affects various functions of the organism, beyond the central nervous system, and its repercussions for patients' quality of life.\n\nPractical Significance of the Results Obtained: The practical significance of this research lies in its potential to inform clinical practice and enhance the QoL for MS patients. Recognizing the unique challenge faced by individuals with primary progressive and secondary progressive MS in terms of bowel and bladder function enables the healthcare providers tailoring interventions and accordingly supporting services.\n\nConclusion: The Multiple sclerosis exerts a multifaceted impact on patients. This study underscored that the type of MS a patient has can significantly affect their bowel and bladder function, potentially leading to difficulties in socialization and sexual function. Acknowledging the study's limitations, including the self-reported data, these findings emphasized the importance of comprehensive care strategies for MS patients.",

        "abstract": "‘Eroticism’, says French philosopher Georges Bataille, ‘is assenting to life up to the point of death.’ The word denotes a quality of the sexual that is beyond the pleasure principle: it is self-loss approximated at the height of life. Communication, of which eroticism is one, entails a provisional imperilling of selfhood, a moment of ‘risk taking’ that, in Bataille’s description, places the being ‘at the limit of death and nothingness.’ A sexual communication, which Bataille likens to a religious festival, ‘provokes an outward movement in the first place.’ Unable to accomplish self-loss, this movement inevitably calls for a ‘retraction and a renunciation.’ But it is the rule with eroticism that this initial recoil ‘organises the merry-go-round’ and, as Bataille concludes in Eroticism (1957), ensures the ‘return of the forward movement.’",

Under the label “Trustworthy AI” (TAI), a promise is formulated, according to which AI can meet criteria of transparency, legality, privacy, non-discrimination, and reliability. In this article, we ask what significance and scope the politically initiated concepts of TAI occupy in the current process of AI dynamics and to what extent they can stand for an independent, unique European or German development path of this technology.",

Machine learning could automatically master data of group of objectives or the environment and learn to output right answer or act right thereby, and AI has already been applied in various occasions in our society, such as facial recognition, automatic driving, and even opponents in some games, various types of monsters are all AI creatures. However, AI may also be dangerous if they lost control, as we saw in many science fiction movies, someday AI machine men want to rule over the human being, threatening our existence. To utilize the powerful ability of AI while preventing the risk that AI may be out of control, we could make AI that only act under human’s command but not motivated by anything material; thereby, all they do is what we human do by ourselves, there would be no risk that they may go out of control as some intelligent animals. And AI is promising to amplify our productivity in organic agriculture, we could use AI to design robots that have intelligence to know how to finish the agricultural works by themselves, we human could train their intelligence and supervise their actions.",

I give two plausible examples, one involving a military mine-sweeping robot and the other, a toy dinosaur called a ‘Pleo’. These experiences of primary recognition do not, however, settle the question of whether any particular AI can be considered a true moral patient or a ‘person’.",

        "published": "2024-2-20",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn this paper, we demonstrate how the language and reasonings that academics, developers, consumers, marketers, and journalists deploy to accept or reject AI as authentic intelligence has far-reaching bearing on how we understand our human intelligence and condition. The discourse on AI is part of what we call the “authenticity negotiation process” through which AI’s “intelligence” is given a particular meaning and value. This has implications for scientific theory, research directions, ethical guidelines, design principles, funding, media attention, and the way people relate to and act upon AI. It also has great impact on humanity’s self-image and the way we negotiate what it means to be human, existentially, culturally, politically, and legally. We use a discourse analysis of academic papers, AI education programs, and online discussions to demonstrate how AI itself, as well as the products, services, and decisions delivered by AI systems are negotiated as authentic or inauthentic intelligence. In this negotiation process, AI stakeholders indirectly define and essentialize what being human(like) means. The main argument we will develop is that this process of indirectly defining and essentializing humans results in an elimination of the space for humans to be indeterminate. By eliminating this space and, hence, denying indeterminacy, the existential condition of the human being is jeopardized. Rather than re-creating humanity in AI, the AI discourse is re-defining what it means to be human and how humanity is valued and should be treated.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable advancements, stretching the limits of what is possible and opening up new frontiers. This comparative review investigates the evolving landscape of AI advancements, providing a thorough exploration of innovative techniques that have shaped the field. Beginning with the fundamentals of AI, including traditional machine learning and the transition to data-driven approaches, the narrative progresses through core AI techniques such as reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, transfer learning, and neuroevolution. The significance of explainable AI (XAI) is emphasized in this review, which also explores the intersection of quantum computing and AI. The review delves into the potential transformative effects of quantum technologies on AI advancements and highlights the challenges associated with their integration. Ethical considerations in AI, including discussions on bias, fairness, transparency, and regulatory frameworks, are also addressed. This review aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the rapidly evolving field of AI. Reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and transfer learning lead AI research, with a growing emphasis on transparency. Neuroevolution and quantum AI, though less studied, show potential for future developments.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWe are living through a revolutionary moment in AI history. Users from diverse walks of life are adopting and using AI systems for their everyday use cases at a pace that has never been seen before. However, with this proliferation, there is also a growing recognition that many of the central open problems within AI are connected to how the user interacts with these systems. To name two prominent examples, consider the problems of explainability and value alignment. Each problem has received considerable attention within the wider AI community, and much promising progress has been made in addressing each of these individual problems. However, each of these problems tends to be studied in isolation, using very different theoretical frameworks, while a closer look at each easily reveals striking similarities between the two problems. In this article, I wish to discuss the framework of human‐aware AI (HAAI) that aims to provide a unified formal framework to understand and evaluate human–AI interaction. We will see how this framework can be used to both understand explainability and value alignment and how the framework also lays out potential novel avenues to address these problems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper makes the case for a sharper terminology regarding AIs cognitive abilities. In arguing that thinking requires more than content production, I offer a definition of meaning drawing on a clear distinction between living and machine intelligence. A pivotal argument is the re-use of the Turing Test (TT) for understanding which theories of meaning and consciousness are no longer plausible—because they have been reproduced by software without thereby gaining conscious experience. In following the few theories that have not (yet) failed this reversed Turing Test (RTT), the focus turns towards rethinking the human condition in times of AI along the lines of three questions: What if a machine developed consciousness? What if AI proceeded without developing a consciousness? What, if machinic and human intelligence merged? These three questions in the end lead to examining three related possible futures of humanism as now determined by the relation between Human Intelligence and AI.",

        "abstract": "AbstractImpact sourcing is the practice of employing socio-economically disadvantaged individuals at business process outsourcing centres to reduce poverty and create secure jobs. One of the pioneers of impact sourcing is Sama, a training-data company that focuses on annotating data for artificial intelligence (AI) systems and claims to support an ethical AI supply chain through its business operations. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken at three of Sama’s East African delivery centres in Kenya and Uganda and follow-up online interviews, this article interrogates Sama’s claims regarding the benefits of its impact sourcing model. Our analysis reveals alarming accounts of low wages, insecure work, a tightly disciplined labour management process, gender-based exploitation and harassment and a system designed to extract value from low-paid workers to produce profits for investors. We argue that competitive market-based dynamics generate a powerful force that pushes such companies towards limiting the actual social impact of their business model in favour of ensuring higher profit margins. This force can be resisted, but only through countervailing measures such as pressure from organised workers, civil society, or regulation. These findings have broad implications related to working conditions for low-wage data annotators across the sector and cast doubt on the ethical nature of AI products that rely on this form of AI data work.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivated by the question of responsible AI and value alignment, I seek to offer a uniquely Foucauldian reconstruction of the problem as the emergence of an ethical subject in a disciplinary setting. This reconstruction contrasts with the strictly human-oriented programme typical to current scholarship that often views technology in instrumental terms. With this in mind, I problematise the concept of a technological subjectivity through an exploration of various aspects of ChatGPT in light of Foucault’s work, arguing that current systems lack the reflexivity and self-formative characteristics inherent in the notion of the subject. By drawing upon a recent dialogue between Foucault and phenomenology, I suggest four techno-philosophical desiderata that would address the gaps in this search for a technological subjectivity: embodied self-care, embodied intentionality, imagination and reflexivity. Thus I propose that advanced AI be reconceptualised as a subject capable of “technical” self-crafting and reflexive self-conduct, opening new pathways to grasp the intertwinement of the human and the artificial. This reconceptualisation holds the potential to render future AI technology more transparent and responsible in the circulation of knowledge, care and power.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHype around Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a feature of this technology since its inception. However, the most recent wave of AI hype has been leveraged to encourage adoption of AI technologies that cause issues for marginalised communities. Hype is also a means to obfuscate real issues of bias, harm, and exploitation felt most sharply by marginalised communities when AI is implemented. This therefore raises the question of power imbalances as a feature of AI technologies as we currently know them. This paper will study the relationship of AI hype and marginalised communities, with particular emphasis on the LGBTQ + community, and look at the way that AI impacts on this community. This paper will pose two key questions: does hype affect marginalised communities, particularly hype around new technologies such as AI; and what impact does the LGBTQ + community experience as a result of hype. This paper will then move on to discuss areas that provide a focus for discourse of AI hype and the impact on the LGBTQ + community: policy and decision-making, the maintenance of the cisgender heteronormative (cishet) baseline, the ubiquity of a mythology of AI, and the role of market expansion.",

        "abstract": "Architecture and man – these are the two most important supporting motifs in the over 20 years long photographic work of Anton Baša. The relationship to both of these subjects is deeply rooted in his personality. Colourful work is very characteristic for the author, gradually becoming prominent in his documentary sets from music festivals, and most significant in the presented series Brightonians (2011). The cycle of portraits illustrates the cultural, religious and ethnic diversity of the city in the south of England, where the photographer spent five years of his life and took portraits of passers-by during random encounters while wandering around the city. The projects named Fuerteventura (2011) and Urban Silence (2018) express the desire to find peace and reflect on the deeper contexts of human life, scenery and symbols in the urban spaces of industrial and urban landscapes. A characteristic feature of Baša ‘s work is in the way the individual series are created. With the exception of Brightonians and the photographs of architecture, the meaning and narrative of the individual series only come to life during editing and selection of photographs, while photography as such is almost purely a matter of feeling. The images are not created with a predefined intention to create a series, they are rather a selection with similar atmosphere or visuality and therefore can be used in an alternative form while maintaining the relationships between them. Urban Silence reflects the transposition of human presence (directly or indirectly), thematized in the socio-culture of a big city with possible approaches towards ways for its display. Instead of busy scenes that express the first visual manifestation of contemporary metropolises, the ensemble presents images without people and offers the viewer space for individual interpretation. The Japan (2014) and Brighton Beach (2006 – 2011) projects are the result of a fusion of approaches from the previously mentioned projects. In them, the author combines a systematic collection of photographs with the presence of people, keeping his distance from the scene and not communicating with its actors.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe need for fair and just AI is often related to the possibility of understanding AI itself, in other words, of turning an opaque box into a glass box, as inspectable as possible. Transparency and explainability, however, pertain to the technical domain and to philosophy of science, thus leaving the ethics and epistemology of AI largely disconnected. To remedy this, we propose an integrated approach premised on the idea that a glass-box epistemology should explicitly consider how to incorporate values and other normative considerations, such as intersectoral vulnerabilities, at critical stages of the whole process from design and implementation to use and assessment. To connect ethics and epistemology of AI, we perform a double shift of focus. First, we move from trusting the output of an AI system to trusting the process that leads to the outcome. Second, we move from expert assessment to more inclusive assessment strategies, aiming to facilitate expert and non-expert assessment. Together, these two moves yield a framework usable for experts and non-experts when they inquire into relevant epistemological and ethical aspects of AI systems. We dub our framework ‘epistemology-cum-ethics’ to signal the equal importance of both aspects. We develop it from the vantage point of the designers: how to create the conditions to internalize values into the whole process of design, implementation, use, and assessment of an AI system, in which values (epistemic and non-epistemic) are explicitly considered at each stage and inspectable by every salient actor involved at any moment.",

This paper explores the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven cyberattacks, offering insights into their implications, mitigation strategies, underlying motivations, and profound societal impacts. The research centres on developing and presenting the AI Cybersecurity Dimensions (AICD) Framework, a comprehensive, multidimensional schema designed to guide academics, policymakers, and industry professionals in understanding and combating the evolving challenges posed by AI-driven cyber threats. The research unveils the complex dynamics of offensive AI, stressing the need for adaptive defences and ethical considerations. Concurrently, the study highlights adversarial AI threats, calling for proactive measures to address their potential ramifications. Through rigorous textual analyses and extensive literature reviews, the paper underscores the urgency for interdisciplinary approaches to bridge the technology-humanity chasm traditionally observed in cybersecurity discussions. By synthesising these diverse elements, the AICD Framework emerges as an instrumental tool for holistic understanding and practical interventions in the AI-infused cybersecurity landscape. The paper concludes with an urgent call for collaborative efforts in research and practice to navigate the intricate challenges and capitalise on the opportunities borne from the convergence of AI and cybersecurity.",

        "abstract": "This article sets out to identify a constructionist framework for a new and expanded “embedded liberalism” and WTO reforms in the global trading system. Globalization and populism led the Trump administration to attack the WTO system by introducing unilateral protectionist measures and undermining its rules and norms. US populist trade policies have persisted under President Biden. Necessary steps to restore the WTO system include (a) domestic reforms by WTO members to improve economic adjustment, labor mobility, and social safety nets; (b) WTO reforms to allow for additional domestic policy space, new negotiated rules to address contentious issues, and a relaxation of the consensus rule; and (c) US restoration of its commitment to multilateral trade rules. Renewed global leadership will be required to pursue these steps. If the current WTO agreement proves to be incapable of resolving these issues, countries will turn increasingly to the alternative of regional trade agreements, which may be able to re-create the conditions for a return to a rules-based global trading system. Yet populism, anti-globalization pressures, and geopolitical tensions present the danger of a continued unwillingness to cooperate among major countries.",

        "citations": 0,
        "abstract": "AbstractThis article presents a perspective that the interplay between high-level ethical principles, ethical praxis, plans, situated actions, and procedural norms influences ethical AI practices. This is grounded in six case studies, drawn from fifty interviews with stakeholders involved in AI governance in Russia. Each case study focuses on a different ethical principle—privacy, fairness, transparency, human oversight, social impact, and accuracy. The paper proposes a feedback loop that emerges from human-AI interactions. This loop begins with the operationalization of high-level ethical principles at the company level into ethical praxis, and plans derived from it. However, real-world implementation introduces situated actions—unforeseen events that challenge the original plans. These turn into procedural norms via routinization and feed back into the understanding of operationalized ethical principles. This feedback loop serves as an informal regulatory mechanism, refining ethical praxis based on contextual experiences. The study underscores the importance of bottom-up experiences in shaping AI's ethical boundaries and calls for policies that acknowledge both high-level principles and emerging micro-level norms. This approach can foster responsive AI governance, rooted in both ethical principles and real-world experiences.",

        "abstract": "AbstractOrganizations that develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) systems need to manage the associated risks—for economic, legal, and ethical reasons. However, it is not always clear who is responsible for AI risk management. The three lines of defense (3LoD) model, which is considered best practice in many industries, might offer a solution. It is a risk management framework that helps organizations to assign and coordinate risk management roles and responsibilities. In this article, I suggest ways in which AI companies could implement the model. I also discuss how the model could help reduce risks from AI: it could identify and close gaps in risk coverage, increase the effectiveness of risk management practices, and enable the board of directors to oversee management more effectively. The article is intended to inform decision-makers at leading AI companies, regulators, and standard-setting bodies.",

        "abstract": "The concept of a digital twin is intriguing as it presents an innovative approach to solving numerous real-world challenges. Initially emerging from the domains of manufacturing and engineering, digital twin research has transcended its origins and now finds applications across a wide range of disciplines. This multidisciplinary expansion has impressively demonstrated the potential of digital twin research. While the simulation aspect of a digital twin is often emphasized, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is severely understudied. For this reason, in this paper, we highlight the pivotal role of AI and ML for digital twin research. By recognizing that a digital twin is a component of a broader Digital Twin System (DTS), we can fully grasp the diverse applications of AI and ML. In this paper, we explore six AI techniques—(1) optimization (model creation), (2) optimization (model updating), (3) generative modeling, (4) data analytics, (5) predictive analytics and (6) decision making—and their potential to advance applications in health, climate science, and sustainability.",

        "citations": 2,
        "abstract": "AbstractAI ethics is proposed, by the Big Tech companies which lead AI research and development, as the cure for diverse social problems posed by the commercialization of data-intensive technologies. It aims to reconcile capitalist AI production with ethics. However, AI ethics is itself now the subject of wide criticism; most notably, it is accused of being no more than “ethics washing” a cynical means of dissimulation for Big Tech, while it continues its business operations unchanged. This paper aims to critically assess, and go beyond the ethics washing thesis. I argue that AI ethics is indeed ethics washing, but not only that. It has a more significant economic function for Big Tech. To make this argument I draw on the theory of intellectual monopoly capital. I argue that ethics washing is better understood as a subordinated innovation network: a dispersed network of contributors beyond Big Tech’s formal employment whose research is indirectly planned by Big Tech, which also appropriates its results. These results are not intended to render AI more ethical, but rather to advance the business processes of data-intensive capital. Because the parameters of AI ethics are indirectly set in advance by Big tech, the ostensible goal that AI ethics sets for itself—to resolve the contradiction between business and ethics—is in fact insoluble. I demonstrate this via an analysis of the latest trend in AI ethics: the operationalization of ethical principles.",

It argues that MIT computer scientists resisted attempts by the state to control the future of computing by fabricating imaginaries to covertly exert influence over the research environment. The paper examines the impact of the Cold War military–industrial complex on academia, which provided opportunities for research to take place whilst introducing challenges to autonomy. It makes the case that computer scientists such as Marvin Minsky and Fernando J. Corbato carefully shaped narratives across film, television and the media to promote desirable futures centering their own technical approaches. Acknowledging that instruments of the state appealed to the future to guide research towards strategically sensitive areas in the context of Cold War technoscientific contest, it asserts that intensifying ties between military and academic institutions afforded researchers both the latitude and motivation to construct independent visions of the future. In doing so, the paper aims to complicate assumptions about imaginaries as solely tools of governance by highlighting scientists' creativity in navigating institutional constraints to wrest back control of the future.",

An increasing number of legal challenges around the world illustrates this. A surge of recent work has focussed on the technical, legal or regulatory challenges but not necessarily the real-world day to day challenges for practitioners such as data collection or fairness by design. Since the publication of the Holstein et al.’s study in 2019, additional legislation, regulation and multiple bodies have been created to address practitioner challenge. This study asks what, if anything, has improved for practitioners between 2019 and 2022. Study 1 conducts an investigation into real-world needs within industry and asks whether practitioners are now able to mitigate challenges in a more robust manner. A further pilot study on the perception of AI examines whether perception of AI impacts practitioner work. The results show increasing and continuing interdisciplinary issues. Where increased regulation and legislation might have seemed reasonable, the result for practitioners is indecision and overwhelm. Based on these findings, we highlight directions for future research in this area. The most problematic area being human factors.",

Recently, advances in molecular diagnostics have made progress in determining treatment strategies; however, the robust treatment has not yet been elucidated. We, herein, present a case of infantile glioma occurring at the cervicomedullary region.\n\n\nCase Description: \nA 5-month-old infant developed left upper limb weakness and torticollis at 3 months of age. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2 hyperintensity from the medulla oblongata to the upper cervical cord. She underwent a biopsy for the lesion and pathological examination findings confirmed the presence of a high-grade astrocytoma with IDH wildtype-, H3K27M wildtype-, BRAF wildtype-, and ETV-NTRK3 fusion-positivity. Postoperatively, she underwent chemoradiotherapy, but she had marked tumor growth during the treatment. According to the new World Health Organization classification, the patient’s tumor is an infantile “hemispheric” glioma.\n\n\nConclusion: \nThe characteristics and prognosis of NTRK-fused glioma are not fully understood, it is noteworthy that these tumors commonly occur in the brainstem. Further studies are needed to determine the prognosis of each tumor type and its sensitivity to treatment. This information will help in the reclassification of the tumors and identification of the precise treatment of this rare type of tumor.\n",

        "abstract": "The proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has shown impressive success in image synthesis. Artificial GAN-based synthesized images have been widely spread over the Internet with the advancement in generating naturalistic and photo-realistic images. This might have the ability to improve content and media; however, it also constitutes a threat with regard to legitimacy, authenticity, and security. Moreover, implementing an automated system that is able to detect and recognize GAN-generated images is significant for image synthesis models as an evaluation tool, regardless of the input modality. To this end, we propose a framework for reliably detecting AI-generated images from real ones through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). First, GAN-generated images were collected based on different tasks and different architectures to help with the generalization. Then, transfer learning was applied. Finally, several Class Activation Maps (CAM) were integrated to determine the discriminative regions that guided the classification model in its decision. Our approach achieved 100% on our dataset, i.e., Real or Synthetic Images (RSI), and a superior performance on other datasets and configurations in terms of its accuracy. Hence, it can be used as an evaluation tool in image generation. Our best detector was a pre-trained EfficientNetB4 fine-tuned on our dataset with a batch size of 64 and an initial learning rate of 0.001 for 20 epochs. Adam was used as an optimizer, and learning rate reduction along with data augmentation were incorporated.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe appearance of large language models (LLMs) and other forms of generative AI portend a new era of disruption and innovation for the news industry, this time focused on the production and consumption of news rather than on its distribution. Large news organizations, however, may be surprisingly well‐prepared for at least some of this disruption because of earlier innovation work on automating workflows for personalized content and formats using structured techniques. This article reviews this work and uses examples from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and other large news providers to show how LLMs have recently been successfully applied to addressing significant barriers to the deployment of structured approaches in production, and how innovation using structured techniques has more generally framed significant editorial and product challenges that might now be more readily addressed using generative AI. Using the BBC's next‐generation authoring and publishing stack as an example, the article also discusses how earlier innovation work has influenced the design of flexible infrastructure that can accommodate uncertainty in audience behavior and editorial workflows – capabilities that are likely to be well suited to the fast‐approaching AI‐mediated news ecosystem.",

        "published": "2023-8-30",
        "citations": 0,
        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents an initial exploration of the concept of AI system recall, primarily understood as a last resort when AI systems violate ethical norms, societal expectations, or legal obligations. The discussion is spurred by recent incidents involving notable AI systems, demonstrating that AI recalls can be a very real necessity. This study delves into the concept of product recall as traditionally understood in industry and explores its potential application to AI systems. Our analysis of this concept is centered around two prominent categories of recall drivers in the AI domain: ethical-social and legal considerations. In terms of ethical-social drivers, we apply the innovative notion of “moral Operational Design Domain”, suggesting AI systems should be recalled when they violate ethical principles and societal expectation. In addition, we also explore the recall of AI systems from a legal perspective, where the recently proposed AI Act provides regulatory measures for recalling AI systems that pose risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights. The paper also underscores the need for further research, especially around defining precise ethical and societal triggers for AI recalls, creating an efficient recall management framework for organizations, and reassessing the fit of traditional product recall models for AI systems within the AI Act's regulatory context. By probing these complex intersections between AI, ethics, and regulation, this work aims to contribute to the development of robust and responsible AI systems while maintaining readiness for failure scenarios.",

To reduce these risks to an acceptable level, AI companies need an effective risk management process and sound risk governance. In this paper, we explore a particular way in which AI companies can improve their risk governance: by setting up an AI ethics board. We identify five key design choices: (1) What responsibilities should the board have? (2) What should its legal structure be? (3) Who should sit on the board? (4) How should it make decisions? (5) And what resources does it need? We break each of these questions down into more specific sub-questions, list options, and discuss how different design choices affect the board’s ability to reduce societal risks from AI. Several failures have shown that designing an AI ethics board can be challenging. This paper provides a toolbox that can help AI companies to overcome these challenges.",

We ground our analysis of the impact of xenophobia by first identifying distinct types of xenophobic harms, and then applying this framework across a number of prominent AI application domains, reviewing the potential interplay between AI and xenophobia on social media and recommendation systems, healthcare, immigration, employment, as well as biases in large pre-trained models.

        "abstract": "AbstractIn the mid-2023, promoters of artificial intelligence (AI) as an “existential risk” coined a new term, “frontier AI,” that refers to “highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety.” Promoters of this new term were able to disseminate it via the United Kingdom (UK) government’s Frontier AI Taskforce (formerly the Foundation Models Taskforce) as well as the UK’s AI Safety Summit, held in November 2023.I argue that adoption of the term “frontier AI” is harmful and contributes to AI hype. Promoting this new term is a way for its boosters to focus the public conversation around the AI-related risks they think are most important, namely “existential risk”—a scenario in which AI is able to bring about the destruction of humanity. Simultaneously, “frontier AI” is a re-branding exercise for the large-scale generative machine learning (ML) models that have been shown to cause severe and pervasive harms (including psychological, social, and environmental harms). Unlike “existential risk,” these harms are actual rather than theoretical, whereas the term “frontier AI” moves our collective focus away from actual harms to focus on hypothetical doomsday scenarios.Moreover, “frontier AI” as a term invokes the colonial mindset, further reinscribing the harmful dynamics between the handful of powerful Western companies who produce today’s generative AI models and the people of the “Global South” who are most likely to experience harm as a direct result of the development and deployment of these AI technologies.",

Sokchanlina and Pieter portray a fraught relationship between place and identity, integrating a sense of belonging integral to a residence and connecting the medium of photography with the appeal of a home. This article explores the conceptual and aesthetic strategies used by the artists to convey the personal and communal history of place in Cambodia and Indonesia. The artists explore a three-fold intent of place, as having a geographical presence, as an environment to conduct social relations, and as an entity encouraging inherent attachment, constantly shifting between the various connotations, creating intermediary nuances between the meanings. Their methodology of using placemaking to deconstruct the traditional model of a home using contemporary art with a community’s heritage creates a unique Southeast Asian identity. The interaction between people and spaces, the configuration of values and identities, and the manifestation of personal and collective memory consolidate the idea of placemaking with the aesthetics of home.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAccording to a growing number of researchers, AI may pose catastrophic – or even existential – risks to humanity. Catastrophic risks may be taken to be risks of 100 million human deaths, or a similarly bad outcome. I argue that such risks – while contested – are sufficiently likely to demand rigorous discussion of potential societal responses. Subsequently, I propose four desiderata for approaches to the reduction of catastrophic risks from AI. The quality of such approaches can be assessed by their chance of success, degree of beneficence, degree of non-maleficence, and beneficent side effects. Then, I employ these desiderata to evaluate the promises, limitations and risks of alignment research, timelines research, policy research, halting or slowing down AI research, and compute governance for tackling catastrophic AI risks. While more research is needed, this investigation shows that several approaches for dealing with catastrophic AI risks are available, and where their respective strengths and weaknesses lie. It turns out that many approaches are complementary and that the approaches have a nuanced relationship to approaches to present AI harms. While some approaches are similarly useful for addressing catastrophic risks and present harms, this is not always the case.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become pervasive in numerous facets of modern life, wielding considerable influence in critical decision-making realms such as healthcare, finance, criminal justice, and beyond. Yet, the inherent opacity of many AI models presents significant hurdles concerning trust, accountability, and fairness. To address these challenges, Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a pivotal area of research, striving to augment the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive exploration of the state-of-the-art in XAI methods and their practical applications. We delve into a spectrum of techniques, spanning from model-agnostic approaches to interpretable machine learning models, meticulously scrutinizing their respective strengths, limitations, and real-world implications. The landscape of XAI is rich and varied, with diverse methodologies tailored to address different facets of interpretability. Model-agnostic approaches offer versatility by providing insights into model behavior across various AI architectures. In contrast, interpretable machine learning models prioritize transparency by design, offering inherent understandability at the expense of some predictive performance. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and attention mechanisms delve into the inner workings of neural networks, shedding light on feature importance and decision processes. Additionally, counterfactual explanations open avenues for exploring what-if scenarios, elucidating the causal relationships between input features and model outcomes. In tandem with methodological exploration, this survey scrutinizes the deployment and impact of XAI across multifarious domains. Successful case studies showcase the practical utility of transparent AI in healthcare diagnostics, financial risk assessment, criminal justice systems, and more. By elucidating these use cases, we illuminate the transformative potential of XAI in enhancing decision-making processes while fostering accountability and fairness. Nevertheless, the journey towards fully transparent AI systems is fraught with challenges and opportunities. As we traverse the current landscape of XAI, we identify pressing areas for further research and development. These include refining interpretability metrics, addressing the scalability of XAI techniques to complex models, and navigating the ethical dimensions of transparency in AI decision-making.Through this survey, we endeavor to cultivate a deeper understanding of transparency in AI decision-making, empowering stakeholders to navigate the intricate interplay between accuracy, interpretability, and ethical considerations. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and inspiring collaborative innovation, we aspire to catalyze future advancements in Explainable AI, ultimately paving the way towards more accountable and trustworthy AI systems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractEthical considerations for assessing the collective benefit of an AI’s policy recommendations are different from assessing the ethical consequences from interacting with an individual. The study of population ethics provides a framework for studying collective benefit or harm in abstract terms. Research into happiness has made significant strides in identifying some key drivers of subjective well-being as measured both individually and collectively across societies. This research examines models from population ethics and statistical studies of subjective well-being to create a measure of benefit with which to judge AI recommendations. These models include refining estimations of the interaction between cultural aspects and economic development and incorporating measures of inequality of happiness and satisfaction through a society. When the impacts of a proposed policy are simulated for multiple successive years, risk discounting is used to measure Net Present Happiness, thus solving the conundrum of considering future generations in ethical considerations as posed in population ethics. Lastly, the Risk-Adjusted Gain in Net Present Happiness is proposed as a reasonable approach to ranking AI policy recommendations and as an AI objective function.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, “AI hype” has taken over public media, oscillating between sensationalism and concerns about the societal implications of AI growth. The latest historical wave of AI hype indexes a period of increased research, investment, and speculation on machine learning, centred around generative AI, a novel class of machine learning that can generate original media from textual prompts. In this paper, I dive into the production of AI hype in online media, with the aim of prioritising the normative and political dimension of AI hype. Formulating AI as a promise reframes it as a normative project, centrally involving the formation of public and institutional confidence in the technology. The production and dissemination of images, in this context, plays a pivotal role in reinforcing these normative commitments to the public. My argument is divided into four sections. First, I examine the political relevance of stock images as the dominant imagery used to convey AI concepts to the public. These stock images encode specific readings of AI and circulate through public media, significantly influencing perceptions. Second, I look at the dominant images of AI as matters of political concern. Third, as generative AI increasingly contributes to the production of stock imagery, I compare the epistemic work performed by AI-generated outputs and stock images, as both encode style, content, and taxonomic structures of the world. I employ an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to investigate the political economy of AI imagery in digital media, providing a snapshot of how AI hype is materialised and amplified online. With this study, I reaffirm AI’s normative character at the forefront of its political and ethical discourse.",

The main feature of cold gas-dynamic spraying is the absence of high temperatures during the formation of metal coatings, therefore, the absence of oxidation of particle and base materials, non-equilibrium crystallization processes, and high internal stresses in the workpieces. Coatings created in this way are a metal matrix with ceramic particles embedded in it. They are characterized by high strength, good performance properties and can be applied in any thickness. One of the important characteristics of coatings is the adhesion strength. Before spraying on any part, it is necessary to find out which coating material will give the best strength characteristics between the two materials. Therefore, before spraying, it is important to study the specifics of the formation of a durable coating for a given part, as well as to compare the strength characteristics of the cold gas-dynamic spraying method with other methods for restoring parts. In this paper, an analysis of various coating materials used in the restoration of parts by the method of cold gas-dynamic spraying is carried out. The strengths and weaknesses of various coating technologies are determined, as well as recommendations for choosing a material when restoring parts by cold gas-dynamic spraying.",

Despite robust literature about the need for virtue ethics approaches in AI development, little research has directly engaged with the developer community about their progress in this regard. We have thus conducted semi-structured interviews with a worldwide cohort of 40 developers, which focused on their awareness of ethics issues, how they navigate ethical challenges, and the barriers they encounter in developing ethical wisdom. We find developers are largely aware of the ethical territories they must navigate and the moral dilemmas they personally encounter, but they face limited and inconsistent resources for ethical guidance or training. Furthermore, there are significant barriers inhibiting the development of ethical wisdom in the AI developer community, including the industry’s fixation on innovation, the narrow scope of technical practice, limited provisions for reflection and dialogue, and incentive structures that prioritize profits and prestige. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need to address the gap in domain-specific ethical skill and provides recommendations for organizations, educators, and the AI developer community.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nAims\nDirect oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the first-line antithrombotic therapy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). During this period, the incidence of thromboembolisms and major bleeding events has decreased. However, no studies have shown a correlation between them, and even fewer data are available on older patients. Therefore, we evaluated the serial changes in oral anticoagulant (OAC) use and the correlation between DOAC use and the incidence of adverse events among very old patients with NVAF.\n\n\nMethods and results\nWe conducted a historical cohort study in 1320 consecutive patients with NVAF aged ≥80 years who received medical treatment for AF from March 2011 to February 2021. We analysed the temporal trends regarding patients using OACs, including the DOAC prescription rate and incidence of adverse events. Over the last decade, the number of patients using OACs has increased from 228 to approximately 600 person-years. The DOAC prescription rate has significantly increased (4–90%, P &lt; 0.001). The age of the patients and proportion of patients with a HASBLED score ≥3 significantly increased (84 ± 4 to 86 ± 4 years, 16–25%, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The composite incidence of thromboembolisms and major bleeding events significantly decreased (7.02–3.30 events/100 person-years, P &lt; 0.001).\n\n\nConclusion\nThe incidence of thromboembolisms and major bleeding events might be inversely correlated with the increase in the DOAC prescription rate in patients with NVAF aged ≥80 years.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough numerous ethical principles and guidelines have been proposed to guide the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it has proven difficult to translate these principles into actionable practices beyond mere adherence to ethical ideas. This is particularly challenging in the context of AI systems for healthcare, which requires balancing the potential benefits of the solution against the risks to patients and the wider community, including minorities and underserved populations. To address this challenge, we propose a shift from one-size-fits-all ethical principles to contextualized case-based ethical frameworks. This study uses an AI-enabled mHealth application as a case study. Our framework is built on existing ethical guidelines and principles, including the AI4People framework, the EU High-Level Expert Group on trustworthy AI, and wider human rights considerations. Additionally, we incorporate relational perspectives to address human value concerns and moral tensions between individual rights and public health. Our approach is based on ”ethics by design,” where ethical principles are integrated throughout the entire AI development pipeline, ensuring that ethical considerations are not an afterthought but implemented from the beginning. For our case study, we identified 7 ethical principles: fairness, agility, precision, safeguarding humanity, respect for others, trust and accountability, and robustness and reproducibility. We believe that the best way to mitigate and address ethical consequences is by implementing ethical principles in the software development processes that developers commonly use. Finally, we provide examples of how our case-based framework can be applied in practice, using examples of AI-driven mobile applications in healthcare.",
