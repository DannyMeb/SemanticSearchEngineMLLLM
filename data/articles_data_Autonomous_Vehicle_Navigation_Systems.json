        "abstract": " Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a significant impact on the aircraft industry and are used for both military and civilian purposes. The partial or full automation of UAVs is an active research domain that is attracting interest from both the industrial and academic sectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of UAVs, their architectures, and techniques used for autonomous navigation. Autonomous navigation requires the ability to recognize and avoid obstacles, which can be achieved using visual, non-visual, or hybrid techniques. These methods use computer vision and machine learning algorithms and are implemented on a computer system, which may or may not be embedded in the vehicle. After investigating the existing architectures and techniques, a flexible platform is designed. This platform combines the advantages of the existing architectures, materials, and methods. It is based on a compact architecture with the possibility of external communication. This platform is mainly composed of a companion computer for complex tasks like obstacle detection and path planning during mission. When implementing this platform, it is crucial to take into account the capabilities of the companion computer processor and appropriately select techniques. Finally, the paper suggests potential areas for future research in this field. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractCurrently, most of the studies on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) automatic landing systems mainly depend on image information to determine the landing location. However, the system requires a camera, a gimbal system and a separate image-processing device, which increases the weight and power consumption of the UAV, resulting in a shorter flight time. In addition, a large amount of computation and slow reaction speed can cause the camera to miss a proper landing moment. To solve these problems, in this study, the moving direction and relative distance between an object and the automatic landing system were measured using a receive signal strength indicator of the radio-frequency (RF) signal. To improve the movement direction and relative distance estimation accuracy, the noise in the RF signal was minimised using a low pass filter and moving average filter. Based on the filtered RF signal, the acceleration of the multicopter to reach the object was estimated by adopting the proportional navigation algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm for precise landing on a moving vehicle was demonstrated through experiments.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces an advanced lateral control strategy for autonomous vehicles using a clothoid-based approach integrated with an adaptive lookahead mechanism. The primary focus is on enhancing lateral stability and path-tracking accuracy through the application of Euler spirals for smooth curvature transitions, thereby reducing passenger discomfort and the risk of vehicle rollover. An innovative aspect of our work is the adaptive adjustment of lookahead distance based on real-time vehicle dynamics and road geometry, which ensures optimal path following under varying conditions. A quasi-feedback control algorithm constructs optimal clothoids at each time step, generating the appropriate steering input. A lead filter compensates for the vehicle’s lateral dynamics lag, improving control responsiveness and stability. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through a comprehensive co-simulation using TruckSim® and Simulink®, demonstrating significant improvements in lateral control performance across diverse driving scenarios. Future directions include scaling the controller for higher-speed applications and further optimization to minimize off-track errors, particularly for articulated vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Context. Autonomous vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, and one of the important modern challenges in their development is ensuring their effective navigation in space and movement within designated lanes. This paper examines a method of spatial orientation for vehicles using computer vision and artificial neural networks. The research focused on the navigation system of an autonomous vehicle, which incorporates the use of modern distributed and parallel computing technologies.\r\nObjective. The aim of this work is to enhance modern autonomous vehicle navigation algorithms through parallel training of artificial neural networks and to determine the optimal combination of technologies and nodes of devices to increase speed and enable real-time decision-making capabilities in spatial navigation for autonomous vehicles.\r\nMethod. The research establishes that the utilization of computer vision and neural networks for road lane segmentation proves to be an effective method for spatial orientation of autonomous vehicles. For multi-core computing systems, the application of parallel programming technology, OpenMP, for neural network training on processors with varying numbers of parallel threads increases the algorithm’s execution speed. However, the use of CUDA technology for neural network training on a graphics processing unit significantly enhances prediction speeds compared to OpenMP. Additionally, the feasibility of employing PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) technology for training the neural network across multiple graphics processing units (nodes) simultaneously was explored. This approach further improved prediction execution times compared to using a single graphics processing unit.\r\nResults. An algorithm for training and prediction of an artificial neural network was developed using two independent nodes, each equipped with separate graphics processing units, and their synchronization for exchanging training results after each epoch, employing PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) technology. This approach allows for scalable computations across a higher number of resources, significantly expediting the model training process.\r\nConclusions. The conducted experiments have affirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, warranting the recommendation of this research for further advancement in autonomous vehicles and enhancement of their navigational capabilities. Notably, the research outcomes can find applications in various domains, encompassing automotive manufacturing, logistics, and urban transportation infrastructure. The obtained results are expected to assist future researchers in understanding the most efficient hardware and software resources to employ for implementing AI-based navigation systems in autonomous vehicles. Prospects for future investigations may encompass refining the accuracy of the proposed parallel algorithm without compromising its efficiency metrics. Furthermore, there is potential for experimental exploration of the proposed algorithm in more intricate practical scenarios of diverse nature and dimensions.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles has generated considerable interest in their autonomous operation, with path planning emerging as a critical aspect. However, existing road infrastructure confronts challenges due to prolonged use and insufficient maintenance. Previous research on autonomous vehicle navigation has focused on determining the trajectory with the shortest distance, while neglecting road construction information, leading to potential time and energy inefficiencies in real‐world scenarios involving infrastructure development. To address this issue, a digital twin‐embedded multi‐objective autonomous vehicle navigation is proposed under the condition of infrastructure construction. The authors propose an image processing algorithm that leverages captured images of the road construction environment to enable road extraction and modelling of the autonomous vehicle workspace. Additionally, a wavelet neural network is developed to predict real‐time traffic flow, considering its inherent characteristics. Moreover, a multi‐objective brainstorm optimisation (BSO)‐based method for path planning is introduced, which optimises total time‐cost and energy consumption objective functions. To ensure optimal trajectory planning during infrastructure construction, the algorithm incorporates a real‐time updated digital twin throughout autonomous vehicle operations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are validated through simulation and comparative studies conducted in diverse scenarios involving road construction. The results highlight the improved performance and reliability of the autonomous vehicle system when equipped with the authors’ approach, demonstrating its potential for enhancing efficiency and minimising disruptions caused by road infrastructure development.",

        "abstract": "Reliable navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) remains a challenge due to the unavailability of a global positioning system underwater. However, the self-localization uncertainty of an AUV with an acoustic receiver can potentially be reduced by leveraging passive acoustic ranging techniques. In particular, in shallow water, the range between an acoustic source and a passive receiver can be estimated using the waveguide invariant. In this work, we develop a sequential Bayes navigation filter that fuses passive recordings of an acoustic source with the measurements of an inertial sensor. The acoustic source can either be cooperative or a source of opportunity, e.g., a container ship. Using particle-based processing, our filter can either estimate the waveguide invariant or the AUV position by making use of a detailed nonlinear statistical model of the received signal. If the position of the AUV is accurately known, e.g., in the beginning of the AUV’s mission, the waveguide invariant can be estimated. Alternatively, assuming that accurate waveguide invariant information is available, range information can be obtained and used to improve the estimate of the AUV’s position. The navigation capability provided by the proposed sequential Bayes filter is demonstrated using simulated and real data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractNavigation safety at sea is vital for each autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), which involves the problem of motion planning in dynamic environments and their robust tracking through feedback control. We present a practical path-planning method that generates smooth trajectories for a marine vehicle traveling in an unknown environment, where obstacles are detected in real time by millimetre wave (mmWave) radar. Our approach introduces a polynomial curve to describe the lateral and longitudinal trajectories in the Frenet frame, known as the ‘motion primitives’, whose combination ensures that the planning area is properly covered. In addition, we can select a feasible, optimal and collision-free trajectory from such a set of motion primitives that is generated by considering the vehicle dynamics and comfort. The capabilities of proposed algorithm are demonstrated in the experiment with static and dynamic obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Lane-level route planning is a critical issue for a lane-level navigation system for autonomous vehicles. Current route-planning methods mainly focus on the road level and applying them directly to search for lane-level routes results in a reduction in search efficiency. In addition, previously developed lane-level methods lack consideration for vehicle characteristics and adaptability to multiple road network structures. To solve this issue, this study proposes an accelerated and refined lane-level route-planning algorithm based on a new lane-level road network model. First, five sub-layers are designed to refine the internal structure of the divided road and intersection areas so that the model can express multiple variations in road network structures. Then, a multi-level route-planning algorithm is designed for sequential planning at the road level, lane group level, lane section level, and lane level to reduce the search space and significantly improve routing efficiency. Last, an optimal lane determination algorithm considering traffic rules, vehicle characteristics, and optimization objectives is developed at the lane level to find the optimal lanes on roads with different configurations, including those with a constant or variable number of lanes while satisfying traffic rules and vehicle characteristics. Tests were performed on simulated road networks and a real road network. The results demonstrate the algorithm’s better adaptability to changing road network structures and vehicle characteristics compared with past hierarchical route planning, and its higher efficiency compared with direct route planning, past hierarchical route planning, and the Apollo route-planning method, which can better support autonomous vehicle navigation.",

        "abstract": "The autonomous grasping operation is the key to the intelligent logistics sorting manipulators. Since the current logistics sorting manipulators mostly use visual sensors to identify objects, they are extremely vulnerable to the changes in the lighting environment. Therefore, the research considers the influence of complex lighting environment on the autonomous grasping of logistics sorting manipulators. Furthermore, it verifies the effectiveness of SAC-AE-ICM algorithm through simulations and experiments. The experimental results show that SAC-AE-ICM algorithm can quickly achieve convergence in many experiments and can obtain global optimization. In the process of automatic capture, the success rate of SAC-AE-ICM algorithm can reach 90%, which is 25% higher than that of the method without ICM and has better convergence. The success rate was as high as 77% for unknown or irregular targets. In practical experiments, SAC-AE-ICM can effectively capture under good lighting conditions. However, under low light conditions, the probability of capturing unknown targets is about 72.5%. Overall, the success rates for single-object and multi-object capture are 88% and 85%, respectively.

This suggested approach aims to address the shortcomings of autonomous cars, such as their poor real- time performance and low control precision. The process for building a virtual simulation environment for autonomous vehicle testing and validation is described in this study. Model Predictive Control and Proportional Integral and Derivative Control are used in MATLAB simulation to build three car models. These are related to the 2D and 3D animation used in collision detection and visualization. The virtual engine visualization is included throughout the model. A variety of test circumstances are used to validate the simulation model, and the model’s performance is assessed in the presence of various barriers. The simulation's findings demonstrate that the autonomous vehicle has a strong potential for self-adaptation even in challenging and complex working environments. No instances of car sideslip or track departure have been noted. It is discovered that this autonomous car performs remarkably well overall when compared to other autonomous vehicles. The suggested approach is essential for enhancing autonomous vehicle driving safety, maintaining vehicle control in challenging situations, and improving the advancement of intelligent vehicle driving assistance.",

        "abstract": "Problem. As one of the three key elements of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play a significant role in material handling systems. They've been around for more than a decade, primarily in Europe. AGVs were formerly utilized mostly in production lines, but due to recent industrial development, they now play a vital role in a variety of different applications and domains, including warehouses, port facilities, transportation systems, and even the medical sector. Goal. The purpose of the work is to analyze two methods of AGV control and the paths that the AGV should follow during transport operations, taking into account safety and limitations for heavy loads that need to be transported in difficult conditions. Methodology. We attempted to provide a summary of the two existing AGV control methods, centralized and decentralized control offered by major manufacturers in this study. Almost all function in a centralized manner, with a single central controller controlling the whole fleet of AGVs. The author sees a tendency toward decentralized systems in which AGVs make individual decisions in favor of transportation flexibility, robustness, and adaptability. A brief explanation of well-known and mature navigation technologies used by AGVs in the industry is also provided, along with both physical and virtual paths to be followed by the AGV during transportation operations, since these technologies get to be a key issue given the safety constraints, particularly for heavy loads to be transported in challenging environments. Results. This paper covers one of the key tasks that must be completed in order to control an AGV system for a central and decentral architecture, for which we have already given a broad overview, as well as the differences between the architectures and their benefits and drawbacks. Originality. The author sees that the merging of various techniques we have will lead to more and new challenges as well as innovations, however, that practical application of distributed control still requires further research and studies and has a way to go in terms of taking other sections such as safety and sustainability into account. Practical value. The primary benefits and drawbacks of various technologies are discussed, as well as how we might improve the efficiency of some of them.",

        "abstract": "High-precision positioning capability is a crucial technology for achieving accurate navigation in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, due to severe electromagnetic wave attenuation underwater and the unavailability of the global positioning system (GPS), inertial-navigation-based dead reckoning is considered the primary method for underwater positioning. Unfortunately, errors accumulated during the navigation process lead to unbounded drift, and filtering-based methods have been used to mitigate the errors, but with limited success. In this paper, we propose a precise underwater dead-reckoning mathematical model that recursively calculates the ground truth and corresponding errors based on an AUV’s motion model, and we derive empirical formulas. Compared to related methods, this approach not only models the cumulative errors of relative noise measurements, but also provides recursive expressions with corresponding statistical moments. The experimental results demonstrate that this formula significantly reduces positioning errors in underwater navigation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are currently one of the most intensively developing branches of marine technology. Their widespread use and versatility allow them to perform tasks that, until recently, required human resources. One problem in AUVs is inadequate navigation, which results in inaccurate positioning. Weaknesses in electronic equipment lead to errors in determining a vehicle’s position during underwater missions, requiring periodic reduction of accumulated errors through the use of radio navigation systems (e.g., GNSS). However, these signals may be unavailable or deliberately distorted. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new computer vision-based method for estimating the position of an AUV. Our method uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to generate the surroundings of the vehicle during temporary surfacing at the point where it is currently located. The next step is to compare this with the shoreline representation on the map, which is generated for a set of points that are in a specific vicinity of a point determined by dead reckoning. This method is primarily intended for low-cost vehicles without advanced navigation systems. Our results suggest that the proposed solution reduces the error in vehicle positioning to 30–60 m and can be used in incomplete shoreline representations. Further research will focus on the use of the proposed method in fully autonomous navigation systems.",
