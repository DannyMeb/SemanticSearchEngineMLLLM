        "abstract": "It is known that animals foraging in the wild must balance their levels of exploitation and exploration so as to maximize resource consumption. This usually manifests as an area-restricted search strategy, such that animals tend to exploit environmental patches and make long excursions between patches. This optimal foraging strategy, however, relies on an underlying assumption: nearby locations yield similar resources. Here, we offer an explanation as to how animals utilize this assumption, which implicitly involves generalization. We also describe the computational mechanisms hypothesized to incorporate factors of exploitation, exploration, and generalization, thus, providing a more holistic picture of animal search strategies. Moreover, we connect this foraging behavior to cognition in general. As such, we suggest that cognitive processes, particularly those involved in sequential decision-making, reuse the computational principles grafted into neural activity by the evolution of optimal foraging. We speculate as to what neurobiological substrates may be using area-restricted search, as well as how a model of exploitation, exploration, and generalization can inform psychopathology.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe chicken swarm optimization (CSO) is a novel swarm intelligence algorithm, which mimics the hierarchal order and foraging behavior in the chicken swarm. However, like other population-based algorithms, CSO also suffers from slow convergence and easily falls into local optima, which partly results from the unbalance between exploration and exploitation. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a chicken swarm optimization with an enhanced exploration-exploitation tradeoff (CSO-EET). To be specific, the search process in CSO-EET is divided into two stages (i.e., exploration and exploitation) according to the swarm diversity. In the exploratory search process, a random solution is employed to find promising solutions. In the exploitative search process, the best solution is used to accelerate convergence. Guided by the swarm diversity, CSO-EET alternates between exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the optimization performance of CSO-EET in both theoretical and practical problems, it is compared with other improved CSO variants and several state-of-the-art algorithms on twenty-two benchmark functions and two real-world problems (i.e., circle packing problem and survival risk prediction of esophageal cancer). The experimental results show that CSO-EET is better than or at least com-parable to all competitors in most cases.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe catecholamines dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision making processes. Although the two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are co-activated, they engage in distinct circuits and roles in modulating neural activity across the brain. However, in the computational neuroscience literature, they have been assigned similar roles in modulating the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to this explore-exploit process is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of dopamine and norepinephrine in mediating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision making task is needed. Here, we ran mice in a restless bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol), and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine receptor activity on exploration - increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulation of exploration via beta-noradrenergic activity was mediated by sex. Computational model parameters revealed that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation via outcome sensitivity. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the transition between exploration and exploitation are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.Significance StatementBoth dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) has been implicated in the decision making process. Although these two catecholamines have shared aspects of their biosynthetic pathways and projection targets, they are thought to exert many core functions via distinct neural targets and receptor subtypes. However, the computational neuroscience literature often ascribes similar roles to these catecholamines, despite the above evidence. Resolving this discrepancy is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. This study examines the role of dopamine and norepinephrine on the explore-exploit tradeoff. By testing mice, we were able to compare multiple pharmacological agents within subjects, and examine source of individual differences, allowing direct comparison between the effects of these two catecholamines in modulating decision making.",

        "abstract": "Adaptive information-sampling approaches enable efficient selection of mobile robots’ waypoints through which the accurate sensing and mapping of a physical process, such as the radiation or field intensity, can be obtained. A key parameter in the informative sampling objective function could be optimized balance the need to explore new information where the uncertainty is very high and to exploit the data sampled so far, with which a great deal of the underlying spatial fields can be obtained, such as the source locations or modalities of the physical process. However, works in the literature have either assumed the robot’s energy is unconstrained or used a homogeneous availability of energy capacity among different robots. Therefore, this paper analyzes the impact of the adaptive information-sampling algorithm’s information function used in exploration and exploitation to achieve a tradeoff between balancing the mapping, localization, and energy efficiency objectives. We use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict and estimate confidence bounds, thereby determining each point’s informativeness. Through extensive experimental data, we provide a deeper and holistic perspective on the effect of information function parameters on the prediction map’s accuracy (RMSE), confidence bound (variance), energy consumption (distance), and time spent (sample count) in both single- and multi-robot scenarios. The results provide meaningful insights into choosing the appropriate energy-aware information function parameters based on sensing objectives (e.g., source localization or mapping). Based on our analysis, we can conclude that it would be detrimental to give importance only to the uncertainty of the information function (which would explode the energy needs) or to the predictive mean of the information (which would jeopardize the mapping accuracy). By assigning more importance to the information uncertainly with some non-zero importance to the information value (e.g., 75:25 ratio), it is possible to achieve an optimal tradeoff between exploration and exploitation objectives while keeping the energy requirements manageable.",

        "abstract": "The literature on the exploration-exploitation tradeoff has anchored on the n-armed bandit problem as its canonical formal representation. This structure, however, omits a fundamental property of evolutionary dynamics. Contrary to a bandit formulation, foregoing an opportunity may negate the possibility of engaging in that opportunity in the future, not just modifying the beliefs about the attractiveness of engaging in that opportunity. Thus, the bandit structure only incorporates path dependence with respect to beliefs and not with regard to capabilities as our usual conceptions of dynamics of learning and capabilities would suggest. Furthermore, the consideration of opportunity cost is rather static and does not address the dynamic unfolding of opportunity structures. The nature of path dependence and opportunity costs are used to frame many of our existing conceptualizations of search processes and firm dynamics, including bandit models, real options, pivoting, the “secretary problem,” and “island” models of firm diversification. The discussion points to the need to develop canonical models of what evolutionary biologists’ term phylogenetic trees and opens up a set of new questions, such as what is the degree of parallelism of trajectories that is possible within an organization, what is the fecundity of different trajectories in terms of likelihood of branching possibilities arising, and how are these latent branching opportunities accessed?",

Here, we aimed to elucidate the distinct roles of dopamine and noradrenaline in the exploration-exploitation tradeoff during human choice. To this end, we used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which participants received either a placebo, 400 mg of the D2/D3 receptor antagonist amisulpride, or 40 mg of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol before they completed a virtual patch-foraging task probing exploration and exploitation. We systematically varied the rewards associated with choice options, the rate by which rewards decreased over time, and the opportunity costs it took to switch to the next option to disentangle the contributions of dopamine and noradrenaline to specific choice aspects. Our data show that amisulpride increased the sensitivity to all of these three critical choice features, whereas propranolol was associated with a reduced tendency to use value information. Our findings provide novel insights into the specific roles of dopamine and noradrenaline in the regulation of human choice behavior, suggesting a critical involvement of dopamine in directed exploration and a role of noradrenaline in more random exploration.",

        "abstract": "Cultures around the world show varying levels of conservatism. While maintaining traditional ideas prevents wrong ones from being embraced, it also slows or prevents adaptation to new times. Without exploration there can be no improvement, but often this effort is wasted as it fails to produce better results, making it better to exploit the best known option. This tension is known as the exploration/exploitation issue, and it occurs at the individual and group levels, whenever decisions are made. As such, it is has been investigated across many disciplines. We extend previous work by approximating a continuum of traits under local exploration, employing the method of adaptive dynamics, and studying multiple fitness functions. In this work, we ask how nature would solve the exploration/exploitation issue, by allowing natural selection to operate on an exploration parameter in a variety of contexts, thinking of exploration as mutation in a trait space with a varying fitness function. Specifically, we study how exploration rates evolve by applying adaptive dynamics to the replicator-mutator equation, under two types of fitness functions. For the first, payoffs are accrued from playing a two-player, two-action symmetric game, we consider representatives of all games in this class, including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Hawk-Dove, and Stag Hunt games, finding exploration rates often evolve downwards, but can also undergo neutral selection as well depending on the games parameters or initial conditions. Second, we study time dependent fitness with a function having a single oscillating peak. By increasing the period, we see a jump in the optimal exploration rate, which then decreases towards zero as the frequency of environmental change increases. These results establish several possible evolutionary scenarios for exploration rates, providing insight into many applications, including why we can see such diversity in rates of cultural change.",

        "abstract": " There are many advantages of geothermal energy, as an environmentally friendly resource; however, for these benefits of geothermal power to be fully maximized, there are some problems that need to be addressed. The primary objective of this research was to examine the influence of intellectual property (IP) rights and economic growth on the geothermal energy output among the 27 European countries within the time frame 1990 to 2021. This study adopts auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL). The findings show that a significant increase in the geothermal energy industry sustainability can occur in EU14 emerged economies using IP rights than in EU13 emerging economies. The major contributions of the research are that among additional factors, intellectual capital, market size, intuitional quality, and economic growth contribute more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU14 emerged economies than in EU13 emerging economies. Results from the analysis show geothermal power sustainability among the 27 European countries could be boosted significantly by adequately putting in place the determining factors of IP as this will foster the attainment of aims behind the energy union by the year 2030. This will no doubt be of help in curbing climate change and environmental pollution in society. The projected calculations were validated through the three estimators adopted for this study, that is, the pooled mean group, mean group, and dynamic fixed effect. The policy implication pointed out by this study the European nations in this study need to make IP indicators to be more effective as this helps in achieving societal and environmental goals. Moreover, the authorities in charge of lawmaking in European countries should focus more on IP areas to ensure the sustainability of geothermal energy generation. Also, authorities in charge of policymaking in the European nations should foster commixture strategies that are sustainable in enhancing IP breakdown as this will assist in fostering geothermal power exploration, thereby reducing the need for fossil fuels which will also carbon dioxide emission in the years to come.

The economic impact of energy shortage has been discussed in such studies as Cheng et al., the economic consequences of the new policy remain unanswered. In this article, we select China's provincial GDP and electricity generation data from 2001 to 2021 to perform causality tests and a double log model which delineates the nexus between GDP growth and electricity generation. We find that (a) electricity generation growth Granger causes GDP growth but not vice versa, and (b) a 1% increase in electricity generation growth will lead to 0.17% increase in GDP growth. The significance of the finding is: as coal still primarily fuels electricity generation, dual control will further hinder China's economic development sans significant enhancement of electric system or expansion of renewable energy, our findings thus support an upgrade of current grid network by China Power International Development; an expansion of renewable capacity such as a proposal of 400 GW new energy project; and construction of energy storage devices such as the CGD Group thermal storage System and Yingcheng Compressed Air Energy Storage System.

        "abstract": " Buckley–Leverett theory and Welge equation is one of the most widely used methods for predicting fluid transport in porous media. However, the average water saturation in Welge equation is a function of both water saturation and water cut, which is inconvenient to be used. While the linear relationship (the slope is 2/3) of the average water saturation and outlet water saturation proposed by Зфрос provides a simple method the oil–water viscosity ratio greatly limits the application. In this paper, based on the analytical relative permeability model and Welge equation, a new average water saturation equation with a variable (the outlet water saturation) was derived and applied in some cases under different relative permeability parameters and oil–water viscosity. Moreover, a simplified equation was proposed through certain data regression. Thus, the coefficient calculation method of the linear function was introduced based on the actual production data. Results showed a nonlinear relationship between the average water saturation and outlet water saturation, which is mainly related to water and oil relative permeability, and oil–water viscosity ratio. For the outlet water saturation higher than frontal saturation, the equation can be simplified to a linear function, which is the derivation of Зфрос equation. However, it is a function of both relative permeability and oil–water viscosity ratio instead of a constant slope of 2/3. In view of the fact that oil–water viscosity is mostly bigger than 10 in most reservoirs, the new model is an important supplement to Buckley–Leverett theory and Welge equation. ",

        "abstract": " The efficient extraction of gas from low-permeability coal seams is an urgent problem in coal mine safety production. The traditional gas extraction technology generally suffers from problems that limited penetration enhancement or extraction effect, low construction efficiency, large workload, etc. Thus, it is especially urgent and important to explore the new technology applicable to efficient underground gas extraction. In this paper, based on the principle of hydraulic fracturing to increase permeability, we innovatively propose a technique to enhance the effect of hydraulic fracturing to increase permeability and further improve the efficiency of gas extraction using the gas desorption activity of native microorganisms in coal seams. Herein, the composition of the primary microbial community of a coal seam in Xinji No.2 mine was analyzed by bacterial and archaeal 16SrDNA amplicon sequencing, the community structure of the main functional microorganisms was clarified, the optimal combination of functional microorganisms for organic matter degradation in coal seam under anaerobic culture conditions was obtained. Besides the Biolog microplate technology was used to screen the nutrients of the excitation carbon source to stimulate the rapid decomposition of coal organic matter by microorganisms and to define the optimal ratio of the excitation carbon source to microorganisms. Finally, the effect of this technology on the application of coal seam fracturing and gas extraction was tested through field industrial tests, revealing that the extraction effect of this technology was more significant than that of the common coal seam perforation extraction technology. The results of this paper provide a new technical idea for gas extraction from low permeability coal seams, which is an important reference value for subsequent similar studies. ",

        "abstract": "In this study, the energy performance analysis of a representative residential building located in Izmir, Turkey, was carried out, utilizing the DesignBuilder energy simulation program. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are modeled as detailed in Design Builder in order to consider parameters such as thermal properties of materials, duct layout and airflow dynamics of the system in detail in the analysis. The technical and economic analysis of transforming the building into a nearly zero energy building (NZEB) was performed for eight different retrofit scenarios, including passive and active energy efficiency measures. The most effective scenario, Scenario 8 (S8), reduced the building's annual net primary energy consumption by 96.08% to 7.45 kWh/m²/year. S8's annual CO2emissions decreased by 100.07% compared with the reference scenario, resulting in −0.042 kg CO2/m²/year. The overall energy performance class of the building was determined using Turkey's national calculation program for the preparation of the energy identity certificate. The energy performance class of the reference building was determined as D, and the class of the building designed according to S8 as A. Investment evaluations were carried out for the retrofit scenarios, revealing that the investment cost for S8, having the lowest net primary energy consumption, amounted to USD 17,565.87. This finding establishes S8 as a more financially viable option in the short term. This study demonstrates the potential of NZEBs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainable development goals.",

There are significant differences in the terrain, climate, and other environmental factors between different provinces, which affect wind power generation. In order to better analyze the situation of wind power generation in Chinese provinces, this paper uses the functional clustering analysis to classify the monthly data of wind power generation in 30 Chinese provinces from March 2013 to October 2019. The empirical results of this paper show that the wind energy generation in Chinese provinces can be divided into three categories, and the results are consistent with the actual situation. In this paper, functional clustering analysis is used to analyze monthly data, compared with the traditional clustering analysis to analyze annual data which are obtained by accumulated monthly data. Higher-dimensional data can be used for analysis to reduce information loss. Moreover, data can be viewed as functions, and more information can be mined by analyzing derivative functions, and so on. The analysis of wind energy generation has certain guiding significance for the development and utilization of renewable energy. ",

        "abstract": " Understanding the microheterogeneity of tight sandstone is the basis of reservoir science, and quantitative characterization of the reservoir’s microheterogeneity is key to reservoir evaluation. In this study, an image-processing analysis method to study the heterogeneity of tight reservoirs is established. A modified Image J plugin is used to accurately identify the surface porosity of a thin casting sheet; the heterogeneity of the microscopic pores in a reservoir is then abstracted into discrete values of the surface porosity. A new parameter for quantitative characterization of the microscopic heterogeneity of tight sandstone, that is, the heterogeneity index Q, is proposed. The fractal dimension calculated via a liquid nitrogen adsorption experiment is used to test the new parameter, and the geological significance of Q is discussed. The results show that Q has a good positive correlation with the fractal dimension, which is beneficial in determining the heterogeneity of the reservoir, pore throat distribution, and roughness of the pore surface. Q has a good correlation with physical parameters such as the specific surface area, average pore diameter, and total pore volume of the sample, indicating that this index can effectively characterize and quantitatively evaluate the reservoir. Therefore, this parameter provides a new basis for reservoir evaluation and classification and provides a new direction for delineating advantageous horizons as well as guiding development and mining.

        "abstract": " The Yushuwan fault is located in the transition zone among the Yimeng uplift, Jinxi fold belt and Shanbei slope in the northeastern Ordos basin and marks the boundary between Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata. According to the field geological survey and geophysical data, this study shows that the Yushuwan fault is a deep-cut northwest-southeast-oriented strike-slip basement fault. A total of 17 apatite and zircon fission track points show that the basin experienced several stages of uplift at 190 Ma, 150–170 Ma, 110–130 Ma, 60–80 Ma, and 20–40 Ma. The characteristics of the Yushuwan fault indicate that the northeastern part of the basin is not a simple slope but rather a step with a large drop. Therefore, in the area to the southwest of the Yushuwan fault, there should be high natural gas resource potential and good exploration prospects. The contour values of the magnetic anomaly on the southwestern side of the fault are high, and the contours are dense; in contrast, the contour values of the northwest magnetic anomaly are low, and the gradient is gentle. Therefore, the fault represents the eastern boundary of the Yimeng uplift, and restricts the eastward extent of the high magnetic anomaly zone in the Yimeng uplift area. ",

It was considered the use of hybridized wind-solar energy resources in smart vehicle technology. A thorough understanding of an integrated framework of the hybridized renewable energy for smart vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems is essential and required to further identify and perhaps maximize existing opportunities. Aiming to develop a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system where the smart vehicle runs on stored sunshine and wind energy, and vehicle batteries store energy and release it to the electricity grid in peak demand periods. To achieve this aim, mathematical models for solar and wind systems were created and entire 24-h simulations were run for case studies of three smart vehicles, which were assessed for different scenarios and circumstances, using the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The estimated values obtained were home load 10 MW, power factor 0.15 MVA, industrial load 0.16 MVA, and smart car-to-grid, solar panel farm, and wind farm power of 4 MW, 8 MW, and 4.5 MW, respectively. Therefore, the hybridized wind-solar energy sources were applicable for all three smart vehicles considered. ",

        "abstract": " In this paper genetic algorithm (GA) was used for the optimization of two natural gas network, the study focuses on fuel consumption minimization of the second gas network. Studies using GA to simultaneously optimize a gas network and a compressor station based on the constraint of the gas network and compressor station are limited. The relationship between several compressor speed and the total fuel consumption and the relationship between the sum of pressure drop in compressor station loops and compressor inlet flow are assessed for optimization. For this purpose, the optimization of two networks was presented and the results were compared with result from analytical methods. The first network problem was to determine the flow rates and node pressures under a given load, which serves as a guide in using GA. Comparison with result from analytical solution showed good agreement of predicted values. The second network consisted of two compressor stations, each containing six compressors with the objective to optimize the fuel consumption of the system. The simulation was divided into two main simulations, the first simulation was the flow optimization, which results in the optimum flow, based on the fitness function, which is the summation of pressure loss for each compressor station. In the second simulation which was the speed optimization, the optimum set of compressor speed was obtained which depends on the fitness function, which is the minimum fuel consumption, the flow obtained from the flow optimization served as input and remained constant. All speeds were simulated together. The predicted results were compared with literature and showed GA can be used for compressor station fuel optimization but still requires improvement. Based on the outcomes, data on natural gas network operations should be accessible to encourage studies on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions minimization. ",

The following hypotheses are tested: (i) Hypothesis 1 ( improving political governance is negatively related to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions); (ii) Hypothesis 2 ( increasing economic governance is negatively related to CO2emissions); and (iii) Hypothesis 3 ( enhancing institutional governance is negatively related to CO2emissions). Results of the tested hypotheses show that the validity of Hypothesis 3 cannot be determined based on the results; Hypothesis 2 is not valid, while Hypothesis 1 is partially not valid. The main policy implication is that governance standards need to be further improved in order for government quality to generate the expected unfavorable effects on CO2emissions.",

        "abstract": " Spatial anomaly detection is an essential part of subsurface data quality control and modeling for resources, e.g., groundwater aquifer, hydrocarbon resources, and mining mineral grades, along with environmental remediation. Efficiently identifying spatial local anomalous regions is important for detecting changes in subsurface population and data acquisition artifacts. Advanced data analytics and machine learning methods may be applied, but often omit essential spatial context with the additional cost of reduced interpretability. Considering the high cost of the risk in subsurface resource exploration, it is essential to maximize the integration of domain expertise. Our proposed method is an ensemble anomaly detection method that calculates the local anomaly probability based on the joint probability density space derived from the semivariogram model. The ensemble approach of our proposed method utilizes multiple local anomaly classifications calculated over a moving search window around each grid of a 2D map or 3D model. The anomalous regions are eventually decided based on the majority rule of the ensemble anomaly classifiers. We demonstrate the proposed method with 3 synthetic exhaustive, map-based, spatial datasets to cover different scenarios for spatial anomaly applications. The proposed ensemble anomaly detection method integrates domain expertise, spatial continuity, and scale of interest. We suggest using the proposed method as an automated tool to effectively identify the spatial local anomalies, based on the rigorous use of spatial continuity and volume variance from geostatistics, to focus professional time.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of grid contingency support devices in power system stability enhancement. The new voltage stability pointer (NVSP) was employed to optimally infer the flexible alternating current transmission systems devices through N − 1 contingency ranking. In this research, the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) was considered as a grid support device. The effectiveness of this technique was validated in R2018a MATLAB with the IEEE 30-bus system using different combinable contingency cases to ascertain the critical lines and vulnerable buses to outages. Based on the results obtained through the NVSP, buses 30, 26, and 29 were cited as STATCOM candidate buses for overall optimal grid performance. The results obtained from the simulation revealed that the total real power loss was reduced by 90.21%. Similarly, the voltage magnitude of the buses was significantly improved to a minimum of 1.00 p.u. after placement of STATCOMs. Further investigation on single STATCOM placement in the IEEE 30-bus system revealed that the highest level of voltage improvement, minimum level of voltage deviation and maximum active power loss reduction was achieved when the STATCOM was placed at bus 30. The overall assessment of the proposed technique yielded better results compared with other methods on the same test system. ",

The gas accumulation patterns of the reservoir are unclear. Considering the geological background, the genesis, migration, and accumulation of natural gas in Jingxi were studied systematically, and favorable exploration targets were predicted. Natural gas in Ma55–Ma510 sub-members is a mixture of Upper Paleozoic and Ordovician products. The Upper Paleozoic coaliferous gas was mainly expulsed downward through the hydrocarbon-providing window where the coal-bearing source rocks made contact with the dolomite reservoirs. The gas then migrated from west to east and accumulated under the condition of lithology variation. The Ordovician petroliferous gas mainly migrated from bottom to top through fractures and mixed with the coaliferous gas in Ma55–Ma510 sub-members. The natural gas reservoir formation model was summarized as the migration of gas over a short distance and partial charging into the dolomite reservoirs from the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic, and the migration of gas over a long distance and massive charging into the dolomite reservoirs during the Late Cretaceous. Ma55 and Ma56 sub-members are the focus of further exploration, and petroliferous gas in Ma57–Ma510 sub-members deserves attention. The dolomite reservoirs of the hydrocarbon-providing windows and the east of these locations are the favorable exploration targets. ",

        "abstract": " In recent years, renewable energy technologies (RETs) have become increasingly popular worldwide to achieve energy sufficiency, reduce reliance on conventional fuels, and mitigate their devastating environmental impact. Nonetheless, more appears to have stayed the same in emerging economies, such as Tunisia, as various barriers hampered the implementation of these technologies. Hence, the prime objective of this article is to conduct a thoughtful assessment of four prominent renewable energy options for electricity generation and explore the most potential barriers hindering their development in Tunisia. To do so, a two-stage approach was applied. First, CRiteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) were used to evaluate the considered alternatives, namely solar PV, concentrated solar power (CSP), onshore wind, and biomass. Then, an integrated step-wise assessment ratio analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach (SWARA-DEMATEL) was developed to identify the most relevant barriers. The related criteria and barriers were determined based on an exhaustive literature review and experts’ feedback. The obtained results indicated that solar PV and wind were the most promising renewable technologies, while biomass was the worst option. To validate the outcome and demonstrate the effect of changing input data on the final results, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out. As for the key obstacles, political instability, high upfront costs, and market access mechanisms were the most influential barriers. Hence, prioritizing different RETs and analyzing the inherent barriers to their utilization would offer insightful guidance to policymakers, enabling them to establish efficient strategies for overcoming these obstacles, and accelerating the deployment of these technologies in the country.

        "abstract": " Spontaneous countercurrent imbibition is one of the essential parameters in the study of formation damage effect in hydrocarbon reservoirs when the drilling fluid is contacted with the drilled formation. Formation damage is considered as one of the harmful phenomena which would seriously affect the efficiency of drilling performances. In this paper, a numerical model was proposed to analyze the main parameters which have profoundly impacted the formation damage. Based on the following parameters of porosity, permeability, water saturation, oil viscosity, pressure drop, contact time, and capillary pressure which were performed in the proposed model, the dominant influence of each parameter was evaluated in more detail. Regarding the high expenditures of scanning electron microscopy and CT scan in petroleum industries, the proposed analytical model would be beneficial instead of spending vast expenditures of experimental evaluation. Subsequently, to provide the accuracy of the model, a set of experimental CT scan data were used to validate the proposed model, and according to the results of this study, it is evident that the proposed model results are in a good agreement with the laboratory data.

        "abstract": " This work's focus is determining how the improvements in wind power technology alter current onshore wind power potential and exploitable electrical energy in Turkey. Then, consequent environmental and economic benefits through substitution of imported hard coal, natural gas and local lignite resources in the Turkish electricity mix have been analyzed. Lack of potential, environmental and economic data kept offshore wind calculations out of the scope of this work. Increasing hub height and power coefficient due to better blade designs of wind turbines can increase 114 thousand MW of onshore wind power potential at 50 m up to 418 thousand MW at 300 m. Consequent wind electricity generation can change in the range of 2.3 × 105–1.95 × 106 GWh. Acknowledging several different conditions operating wind turbines can be subject to and that the whole capacity may not be used, mean value of 1.09 × 106 GWh wind electricity generation is assessed as the limit providable to the Turkish electricity grid. Installable wind power capacity (IWPC) and electricity generation potential (EGP) are both most sensitive to the changes in spacing followed by CP and aging. The level of sensitivity increases at higher hub heights for both IWPC and EGP. Environmentally, substitution of lignite and after 2040 hard coal and lignite by wind power is the most feasible option in improving environmental performance of Turkish electricity mix compared to sole substitution of hard coal, natural gas or lignite. In 2040, wind can replace all lignite hence in the years following 2040, wind can substitute lignite and a second fossil resource. Economically, hard coal and natural gas substitution result in 10.85 billion $ and 7.93 billion $ gain from 2021to 2050. Local job creation and carbon tax mechanisms to be employed in favor of wind power can create additional economic and social benefits for the country. ",

        "abstract": " An unprecedented year has past with Covid-19 lockdown. It has underscored the importance of reliable and uninterrupted power supply. Microgrid ensures reliability and continuity of power supply in a local region with its own local generation and load despatch system, thereby reducing or eliminating the need of a central generator. A microgrid is capable of autonomous operation or it can be connected to a central ac grid that it separates from during disturbances. In this paper results of a microgrid simulation model is presented. Here microgrid system uses two renewable sources namely, solar PV and wind generator along with a battery feeding an inverter supplying load. The system is modeled and implemented using Matlab/simulink environment. The simulation model consists of mono-crystalline solar PV panel of 2.5 kW and a wind turbine emulator having PMDC as wind generator of 1 kW rating as micro sources. For stabilisation of the system a battery bank of 48 V, 100 Ah is also provided. The system is designed to supply a maximum load of 2.5 kW. The system autonomy is approximately two hours for rated load of 2.5 kW. Stability of the system was tested during load variations. The voltage and frequency were found to be stable during load variations. The performance of the inverter to provide constant output voltage of 400 V is good and the output frequency of the inverter is also maintained at 50 Hz. The output voltage conforms to IEC 60038 Standards. An energy management scheme is also developed and simulation results show effectiveness of the scheme. ",

In this present paper, a deep investigation has been accomplished to determine thermal efficiency and cost analysis of solar water heater made in Rwanda. During manufacturing of solar water heater, the collector was the main part to emphasize on. The high efficiency of the system was achieved by replacing galvanized iron sheet by aluminum sheet slotted and black painted as an absorber plate. The ambient temperature and average solar radiation of the three sites where solar water heaters are installed were investigated.

In this study, we seek to answer this puzzling question by reframing exploitation and exploration as adualityof learning (i.e., two modes that are partial complementary forsynergyas well as partial conflicting fortradeoff). Specifically, rather than assuming either apositiveornegativeinteraction between exploration and exploitation as prior literature has done, our study highlights a novel pattern ofinverted U-shaped interactionbetween exploration and exploitation for both radical and incremental innovations. With a Chinese sample of 508 firms, our empirical evidence supports our prediction of two patterns of inverted U-shaped interaction of exploration and exploitation. Such unique findings showcase the unique value of reframing paradox into duality from the meta-perspective of yin-yang balancing to shed new light on organizational ambidexterity and innovation management.",

        "abstract": " The Bongor Basin is a typical lacustrine passive-rifted basin situated in the West and Central African Rift System (WCARS). It has experienced two phases of tectonic inversion and features a complex process of petroleum generation and accumulation. A total of 41 crude oil samples from the basin were geochemically analyzed to investigate their compositions of molecular markers. The results show that the oils have similar origins and are likely to belong to the same oil population. However, there are significant differences in geochemical characteristics and physical properties, caused by the secondary alteration. The relative contents and distribution patterns of normal alkanes and acyclic isoprenoids indicate that some of the oils have suffered biodegradation to varying degrees. The samples can be divided into three categories according to their relative degrees of degradation: normal oil, slightly biodegraded oil (PM 1–3), and severely biodegraded oil (PM 5–7). The burial depth of oil reservoirs in this area is the predominant factor impacting on the level of biodegradation. Crude oils in reservoirs with burial depths of less than 800 m are all severely biodegraded, while oils in reservoirs with burial depths greater than 1300 m have experienced no evident biodegradation. In reservoirs with burial depths between 800 m and 1300 m, the biodegradation degrees vary from normal to severely biodegraded. Oil reservoirs with burial depths less than 1300 m and adjacent to major faults are readily subject to biodegradation, while reservoirs with similar burial depths, but a certain distance away from major faults, have suffered no evident biodegradation. Moreover, if primary reservoirs have been modified by tectonic activity after accumulation, the crude oils are more likely to be biodegraded. Faulted anticline traps may create more favorable geological conditions for preservation of crude oil than reverse extrusion anticline reservoirs. This study may provide practical guidance for the assessment and prediction of oil quality in future oil exploration. ",

First, relative to CO2emissions, enhancing economic growth and population growth engenders a U-shaped pattern whereas increasing inclusive human development shows a Kuznets curve. Second, increasing gross domestic product growth beyond 25% of annual growth is unfavorable for a green economy. Third, a population growth rate of above 3.089% (i.e. annual %) has a positive effect of CO2emissions. Fourth, an inequality-adjusted human development index of above 0.4969 is beneficial for a green economy because it is associated with a reduction in CO2emissions. The established critical masses have policy relevance because they are situated within the policy ranges of adopted economic development dynamics.",

        "abstract": " The European geothermal heating market, at one time dominated by only a handful of countries, is set to experience a purple patch in the coming years as governments scramble to find an affordable alternative to expensive gas-fired heating. The primary focus of this study will be to investigate what effect will worldwide governance factors and economic growth on the geothermal energy output among the 27 European Countries from the time being 1996 to 2021. Using the autoregressive distributed lag, the findings shows that a significant increase in the geothermal energy industry sustainability can occur in European Union 14 (EU14) emerged economies using worldwide governance factors than in EU13 emerging economies. Among additional factors, instability in the political realm, regulatory issues in the area of quality, accountability, and voice-related issues, and the ability to curb corrupt practices contribute more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU14 emerged economies than in European Union 13 (EU13) emerging economies. On the other hand, government effectiveness contributes more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU13 emerging economies than in EU14 emerged economies. The finding implies that geothermal power sustainability in EU region countries can be significantly increased by mounting the level of worldwide governance determinants to achieve Energy Union aims by 2030. This will finally be spread to combat climate change and environmental pollution. All observations on projected calculations are valid. The confirmation was achieved with the aid of the three estimators used in the study which are the pooled mean group estimator, the mean group estimator, and the third one was dynamic fixed effect approach. This study recommended that these European countries need to put more effort in terms of being effective in worldwide governance indicators which will help in goal attainment at the societal and environmental levels. Those in charge of making laws in the European countries should get more engaged in worldwide governance scopes as this will assist in facilitating the security and sustainability of geothermal energy generation. Those in charge of making policies in the EU countries should as well lay more emphasis on the strategies that could be cointegrated and as well sustainable toward worldwide governance fractionation toward the achievement of the sustainability of geothermal power and this will drastically reduce the need or dependence on fossil fuel and emissions coming from carbon dioxide in the future time.

        "abstract": " The dissolution of gypsum rock is of significance to study because it affects the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs, cap rocks and evaporite deposits. However, the characteristics and mechanism of the dissolution process remain unclear. Here, we present data from experiments performed to address this issue. The experiments simulate various geological conditions, including different diagenetic stages of burial under different fluid types. The diagenetic stages include: 30°C and 0.3 MPa for the epidiagenetic stage; 60°C and 13 MPa for the early diagenetic stage; 100°C and 27 MPa for the middle diagenetic stage; and 150°C and 43 MPa for the late diagenetic stage. The different fluid types include pure water representing continental water, seawater, 0.3 wt.% CO2 solution representing meteoric water, and a 0.2 wt.% acetic acid solution representing organic fluid. We also carried out the experiments on limestones and dolomites, because these rocks also occur in saline water sedimentary systems with gypsum rocks. Experimental results show that lithology, fluid type and temperature–pressure conditions can all affect dissolution. In terms of lithology, gypsum rocks dissolve more easily than limestones and dolomites. Fluid type has little effect on the dissolution of gypsum rock, and gypsum is soluble in all four types of fluids. In contrast, limestones and dolomites are almost insoluble in pure water and seawater, but show clear dissolution in CO2 and acetic acid solutions. The data indicate that gypsum rock has a dissolution peak close to the early diagenetic stage. In contrast, limestones and dolomites have dissolution peaks in the CO2 solution at the early–middle diagenetic stage, and do not show a peak in the acetic acid solution under surficial temperature–pressure conditions. The dissolution rates of limestone and dolomite show different trends with increasing temperature and pressure: limestone dissolution rates decline whereas dolomite dissolution rates increase. Therefore, we infer that the physicochemical properties of a rock are important drivers of dissolution. ",

Nowdays, investments in hydropower plants are re-gaining importance given not only its ability in supporting the transition of the electricity grid to get rid of dependence on fossil fuels but also in the provision of numerous other services. In particular, Brazilian hydropower plants contribute to multiple water resources management services such as flood and drought control, groundwater stabilization, water quality management, river navigation, irrigation, leisure and tourism and aquaculture around the country.

        "abstract": " In the current study, a new adaptive binned kernel density estimation method has been introduced. In the proposed new method, Fourier transforms have been utilized to accomplish the convolution rather than performing the convolution by hand. By utilizing the fast Fourier transform, direct and inverse Fourier transforms have been found in a relatively short amount of time when implementing the new method. Upon analyzing the computed results, it has been observed that the newly proposed adaptive binned kernel density estimation distribution curve exhibits a high level of smoothness in the tail region. Furthermore, it demonstrates a strong alignment with the histogram derived from the recorded ocean wave dataset obtained at the NDBC station 46053. These are the major advantages of the proposed new method comparing with other existing methods such as the parametric method, the ordinary KDE method, and Abramson's adaptive KDE method. The specific research gap identified in the field is that none of the existing methods can predict the sea state parameter probability distribution tails both accurately and efficiently, and the proposed new method has successfully addressed this research gap. Upon careful examination of the calculation results, it becomes evident that the projected 50-year extreme power-take-off heaving force value, derived using the newly proposed method, is 1989300N. This value significantly surpasses (by more than 9.5%) the forecasted value of 1816200N obtained through the application of the Rosenblatt-I-SORM contour method. The findings of this study suggest that the newly proposed adaptive binned kernel density estimation method exhibits robustness and demonstrates accurate forecasting capabilities for the 50-year extreme dynamic responses of wave energy converters.

        "abstract": " By combining financial and macroeconomic factors with machine learning techniques, this research paper proposes a novel method for forecasting oil price movements in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Traditional methods generally struggle to capture the complex dynamics and nonlinear linkages in the oil market, which makes accurate oil price forecasting vital for decision-making in numerous sectors. In this paper, we offer a machine learning framework that leverages financial elements like stock market indices, currency rates, and interest rates, as well as macroeconomic data like GDP growth, inflation rates, and energy consumption, as predictors of oil price movements. These factors were chosen because of their significance and importance to the ways in which the oil market in KSA functions. We use several different machine learning techniques to construct the prediction models, some of which are regression-based (such as linear regression or support vector regression) while others are ensemble models (such as random forests or gradient boosting). The models are tested and refined using historical data spanning a sizable period of time and covering a wide range of market circumstances and pricing movements. Evaluation of the prediction models is carried out using conventional metrics like mean-squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared [Formula: see text], and their robustness is evaluated using sensitivity analysis and cross-validation methods. Incorporating financial and macroeconomic variables vastly enhances the accuracy of oil price predictions compared to models based purely on historical price data, as shown by the preliminary findings, which underline the superiority of our approach. The machine learning models exhibit nonlinear pattern capture and responsiveness to market fluctuations. Insights into the relative significance of various variables and their effect on oil price movements in KSA are also provided by the sensitivity analysis. By demonstrating the usefulness of machine learning methods for oil price forecasting, particularly in the context of Saudi Arabia, this research adds to the body of knowledge already available. Our findings have important policy and market implications for oil price forecasting, benefiting policymakers, energy market participants, and investors. To improve the models’ ability to forecast the future, researchers may want to consider including more variables in their analyses, such as geopolitical developments and technology advances. ",

        "abstract": " With the introduction of electric vehicles in the automobile market, limited information is available on how the battery’s energy consumption is distributed. This paper focuses on the energy consumption of the vehicle when the heating and cooling system is in operation. On average, 18 and 14% for the battery’s energy capacity is allocated to heating and cooling requirements, respectively. The conventional internal combustion engine vehicle uses waste heat from its engine to provide for passenger thermal requirements at no cost to the vehicle’s propulsion energy demands. However, the electric vehicle cannot avail of this luxury to recycle waste heat. In order to reduce the energy consumed by the climate control system, an analysis of the temperature profile of a vehicle’s cabin space under various weather conditions is required. The present study presents a temperature predicting algorithm to predict temperature under various weather conditions. Previous studies have limited consideration to the fluctuation of solar radiation space heating to a vehicle’s cabin space. This model predicts solar space heating with a mean bias error and root mean square error of 0.26 and 0.57°C, respectively. This temperature predicting model can potentially be developed with further research to predict the energy required by the vehicle’s primary lithium-ion battery to heat and cool the vehicle’s cabin space. Thus, this model may be used in a route planning application to reduce range anxiety when drivers undertake a journey under various ambient weather conditions while optimising the energy consumption of the electric vehicle.

        "abstract": " Favorable exploration fairway prediction becomes crucial for efficient exploration and development of tight sandstone oil plays due to their relatively poor reservoir quality and strong heterogeneous oil saturation. In order to better understand the factors influencing oil saturation and favorable exploration fairway distribution, petrographic investigation, reservoir properties testing, X-ray diffraction analysis, oil saturation measurement, pressure-controlled mercury injection, and rate-controlled mercury injection were performed on a suite of tight reservoir from the fourth member of the Lower Cretaceous Quantou Formation (K1q4) in the southern Songliao Basin, China. The sandstone reservoirs are characterized by poor reservoir properties and low oil saturations. Reservoir properties between laboratory pressure conditions and in situ conditions are approximately the same, and oil saturations are not controlled by porosity and permeability obviously. Pores are mainly micro-scale, and throats are mainly nano-scale, forming micro- to nano-scale pore–throat system with effective connected pore–throat mainly less than 40%. Oil emplacement mainly occurs through the throats with average radius larger than 0.25 µm under original geological condition. Moreover, the samples with higher oil saturation show more scattered pore and throat distributions, but centered pore–throat radius ratio distribution. Pore–throat volume ratio about 2.3–3.0 is best for oil emplacement, forming high oil saturation. Quartz overgrowth, carbonate cements, and authigenic clays are the major diagenetic minerals. The reservoirs containing about 4–5% carbonate cements are most preferable for oil accumulation, and oil saturation increases with increasing of chlorite as well. The flow zone indicator is a reasonable parameter to predict favorable exploration targets in tight sandstone reservoirs. The reservoirs with flow zone indicator values larger than 0.05 can be regarded as favorable exploration targets in the K1q4 tight sandstones. According to the planar isoline of average flow zone indicator value, the favorable exploration targets mainly distribute in the delta plain distributary channel and deltaic front subaqueous distributary channel.

It discusses the legal context of space exploitation, rejecting oft-repeated promises that space exploitation will yield tangible benefits for the majority of humanity. Surveying recent planetary science research, it argues that most of the easily accessible space resources are scarce, and so do not exist in quantities capable of ameliorating terrestrial resource depletion. It also identifies a need to regulate the use of space resources to prevent especially scarce resources such as lunar and asteroidal water from being wasted on projects that benefit only the already fortunate. It argues that scientific uses of space and its resources should be prioritized.",

        "abstract": "In this chapter, Sarah Langer and Andrea Fried reflect on the relationship between standards and innovation. They observe how studies of the relationship between standards and innovation show contradictory results; standards can both enable and constrain innovation. There are several reviews that deal with the question of the standard–innovation nexus and come to the same conclusion that the results are not satisfactory thus far. By identifying reflexive, diagnostic, self-monitoring, and inadequate ways of monitoring standard enactment, the standard–innovation nexus can be explained in a novel way. The authors suggest that the way in which organizations monitor deviations from standards influences whether their organizational processes are explorative or exploitative in nature. The chapter concludes with propositions for further research.",

        "citations": 22,
        "abstract": " The real exchange rate is a key indicator of a country’s trade competitiveness in the world. This paper investigates the interaction between oil price and real exchange rates in Saudi Arabia during the period January 1986 -March 2019, using monthly data. This study uses the autoregressive distributed lag model and the error correction model in order to investigate the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables. The evidence reveals that there is a strong long-run cointegration. The robustness of the autoregressive distributed lag bounds test cointegration was confirmed using the newly developed combined cointegration, which also provided the same evidence for a strong long-run relationship. In the short term, the results confirm the existence of a unidirectional causal relationship ranging from the oil price to the exchange rate. In the long term, however, the causal relationship is bidirectional between these two variables. An appreciation of the Saudi exchange rate generates an increase in the relative demand for oil, which in turn creates upward pressure on its price. For policy purposes, such evidence suggests that Saudi Arabia should be careful not to put too much weight on the benefits of higher revenue due to higher oil price. ",

        "abstract": " The process of water–gas displacement in water–drive gas reservoirs has been always an important research topic. However, knowledge about the flow patterns of water–gas flow under different conditions is insufficient at present. To investigate the variation of the geometry and position of the water–gas interface as well as the water flooding efficiency with time during water–gas displacement, the distribution law of water and gas at the microcosmic scale is simulated and analysed based on the geometric model of a single pore channel abstracted from the parallel tube bundle model and continuous tube bundle model of a porous medium reservoir, with the help of laminar two-phase flow and the level set module of COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results show the following: (1) Under the combined effects of the boundary layer effect, interfacial tension and pore diameter changes in water–gas displacement, the shape of the water–gas interface changes from a tongue-shape to a U-shape, during which a series of interface shapes, including a piston shape, finger shape, W-shape and Ω-shape, are observed. In the pore channel, the area of the water phase below the pore channel axial is larger than that above the pore channel axial. (2) The pore-throat ratio has a considerable impact on the shape and location of the water–gas interface as well as the displacement efficiency. When the water–gas displacement is from a small pore-channel to a large one, the displacement efficiency increases as the pore-throat ratio decreases. On the contrary, if the water–gas displacement is from a large pore channel to a small one, the displacement efficiency increases as the pore-throat ratio increases. Numerical simulation can be used to study the shape and location of the water–gas interface as well as the displacement efficiency in pore channels with different scales of diameters. ",

In addition to that, rising energy demand, fuel price increases, the need for energy security, climate change, and means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions are significant considerations in all ethical discussions, particularly when considering the human right to food; there is a tension between the usage of land and availability of water and the human need for fuel, such as biofuel. Although biofuels have the potential to alleviate energy difficulties, producing and consuming such fuels raises social, economic, technological, environmental, and ethical concerns due to ethical aspects such as Rights, Duty, Virtue, Utilitarianism, and Sustainability. Furthermore, all participants bear an ethical responsibility to ensure that biofuels are produced and used appropriately, taking into account citizens’ rights to nourishment, well-being, and employment, the environmental sustainability of such fuels, as well as their capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the equitable distribution of such fuels’ costs and benefits. Using human food to produce biofuels has raised several issues since it may jeopardize the human right to enough sustenance for healthy living. In contrast, current biofuel production and use do not meet environmental sustainability requirements. ",

A combination of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and constant power generation (CPG) to control the boost-converter, respectively, in normal operation mode and BGVD under rapidly changing climatic conditions is proposed. MPPT and CPG commands based on artificial neural network algorithms are developed. Their goal is to maintain the operation of the low-voltage grid-connected photovoltaic system under instantaneously BGVD. This approach ensures a balance between the PV power generation and the injected active power when BGVD appears at the common coupling point (CCP). It permits to regulate the PV power to a specific value, to limit the over current at the CCP and to avoid energy aggregation at the DC-link bus. Simulations of 2.5 kW of a two-stage grid-connected PV system to verify the effectiveness of the command approach are presented. ",

When training each artificial neural network, pre-defined amount of data within the new search space are added to the training dataset to improve the estimation performance. When the size of the search space meets a stopping criterion, reservoir simulations are performed for data in the search space, and a global solution is determined among the simulation results.

        "abstract": " The cracking process in Longmaxi formation shale was experimentally studied during uniaxial compressive loading. Both the evolution of the three-dimensional fracture network and the micromechanics of failure in the layered shale were examined as a function of the inclination angle of the bedding plane. To visualize the cracking process, the test devices presented here used an industrial X-ray CT scanner that enabled scanning during the uniaxial compressive loading. Scanning electron microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy imaging techniques were used to observe the microscopic characteristics of fractured surfaces of failed specimens. The combination of these observations clearly illustrated the micromechanics of the failure process in the anisotropic shale. The experimental results suggest that the cracking process could be divided into two stages under uniaxial loading, and the microstructures and bedding planes of the shale played an important role in the cracking process of layered shale. In the first stage of deformation, the cracking mainly occurred as smaller microcracks (such as intergranular, microcracks), and the propagation of the newly formed microcracks was controlled by the bedding plane of the shale specimen. The microscopic imaging study showed that the microscopic damage was mainly dominated by microtensile fractures under uniaxial compression. In the second stage, with the increase in loading, the extensive development and coalescence of the microcracks led to the formation of complex fracture networks. The complexity of the fracture networks was related to the microstructure of the sample. The coalescence of the microcracks could be divided into three levels in the spatial scale, and the coalescence patterns included both tensile and shear patterns. ",

The study uses three income inequality indicators – the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio – to examine these linkages. The study employs the generalised method of moments as the estimation technique. The empirical findings show that financial development unconditionally reduces CO2 emissions in SSA countries. The findings also show that there are threshold levels of income inequality that should not be exceeded in order for the negative impact of financial development on CO2 emissions to be sustained. Specifically, the study finds that the negative impact of financial development on CO2 emissions is likely to change to positive if the following inequality levels are exceeded: 0.591, 0.662 and 5.59, respectively, for the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The findings of this study have far-reaching policy implications not only for SSA countries but also for developing countries as a whole. Policy implications are discussed. ",

If it is recovered and utilized then it can viably play a significant role for process heat on site. This study demonstrates how cleaner production can be applied to the chlor-alkali industry, with focus on utilization of hydrogen as energy resource. A chlor-alkali based on membrane cell process, in northern part of Jordan, was examined as a case of reusing excess hydrogen produced. In the baseline scenario, 47% of produced hydrogen was used in HCl production, 10% in controlling pressure difference, and the remainder was not used (i.e. 43% of hydrogen was vented into the atmosphere). The proposed cleaner production option was to install a hydrogen boiler next to the existing fuel boiler and utilize the hydrogen to generate steam for on-site process heating purposes. The effectiveness of this cleaner production option was discussed in relation to its technical and environmental feasibility. On-site utilization of hydrogen was found to provide 34% of the total steam needed at the full capacity. This in return yields a saving percentage of around 33.37% and a payback period of 0.947 year. From environmental perspective, theoretically, carbon dioxide emission reductions can be up to 1810 tons based on the chlor-alkali productions pattern for 24 consecutive months. ",

Through contact angle measurement, wetting heat measurement, and step-by-step release test to investigate the hydrophobicity of each particle size; in addition, the flotation kinetics test of different particle sizes coal slime was also carried out. The results show that the particle size has a significant effect on the flotation behavior of fine coal slime. The medium particle size −0.25 + 0.074 mm has the best hydrophobicity, followed by −0.5 + 0.25 mm, again −0.5 mm, and finally −0.074 mm particle sizes. Use Origin software to fit six kinetic models to the test data of coal slime flotation kinetics, and analyze the maximum combustible recovery [Formula: see text], flotation rate constant (k), and correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of each particle size, The results show that the first-order model with rectangular distribution of floatabilities can better describe the flotation of coal slime of each particle size.

        "abstract": " Traditional decline curve analyses (DCAs), both deterministic and probabilistic, use specific models to fit production data for production forecasting. Various decline curve models have been applied for unconventional wells, including the Arps model, stretched exponential model, Duong model, and combined capacitance-resistance model. However, it is not straightforward to determine which model should be used, as multiple models may fit a dataset equally well but provide different forecasts, and hastily selecting a model for probabilistic DCA can underestimate the uncertainty in a production forecast. Data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the oil and gas industry by utilizing computing power more effectively and efficiently. We propose a data-driven approach in this paper to performing short term predictions for unconventional oil production. Two states of the art level models have tested: DeepAR and used Prophet time series analysis on petroleum production data. Compared with the traditional approach using decline curve models, the machine learning approach can be regarded as” model-free” (non-parametric) because the pre-determination of decline curve models is not required. The main goal of this work is to develop and apply neural networks and time series techniques to oil well data without having substantial knowledge regarding the extraction process or physical relationship between the geological and dynamic parameters. For evaluation and verification purpose, The proposed method is applied to a selected well of Midland fields from the USA. By comparing our results, we can infer that both DeepAR and Prophet analysis are useful for gaining a better understanding of the behavior of oil wells, and can mitigate over/underestimates resulting from using a single decline curve model for forecasting. In addition, the proposed approach performs well in spreading model uncertainty to uncertainty in production forecasting; that is, we end up with a forecast which outperforms the standard DCA methods.

        "abstract": " In the present research, we have proposed a new adaptive kernel density estimation method formulated on the theory of linear diffusion processes. By examining the calculation results we have found that in the tail region, our proposed new adaptive kernel density estimation distribution curve becomes very smooth and fits quite well with the histogram of the measured ocean wave dataset at the US National Data Buoy Center station 46026. Carefully studying the calculation results also reveals that the 50-year extreme Power-Take-Off heaving force value forecasted based on the environmental contour derived using the new method is 3021700N, which is much larger than the value 2458700N forecasted via the Rosenblatt-inverse second-order reliability method contour method. Consequently, our proposed new adaptive kernel density estimation method formulated on the theory of linear diffusion processes can forecast well and efficiently forecast the 50-year extreme design force values for offshore sustainable energy systems.

        "abstract": " The interpretation model for gas saturation in deep clastic reservoirs subject to intensive extrusion stress relies predominantly on experimental petrophysical data and the expanded Archie equation. Nonetheless, these methodologies may not consistently yield optimum results. Specifically, when subsurface pressure impacts formation resistivity, the resulting curve values exhibit substantial elevations, leading to significant inaccuracies in the precise estimation of gas saturation from resistivity logging data. Consequently, the evaluation of logging interpretations becomes a complex undertaking. This paper aims to comprehensively assess gas saturation in deep clastic reservoirs from both electrical and mechanical perspectives. To achieve this goal, we employ a multifaceted approach encompassing the Archie formula, the stress-corrected variable cementation index saturation model, and the resistivity-corrected saturation model. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and the utilization of simulated experimental data, a quantitative relationship equation between resistivity and stress difference has been established. Building upon this fundamental groundwork, an innovative resistivity-corrected saturation calculation model has been proposed. In comparison to the two alternative models, the new model exhibits enhanced accuracy in calculating gas saturation, as it is less influenced by extrusion stress and gravitational compaction. Furthermore, it demonstrates better consistency with core mercury injection capillary pressure data in determining gas saturation. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for the effective evaluation of deep clastic reservoirs, offering a robust framework for advancing the understanding of gas saturation in the face of complex geological and geophysical challenges.

        "abstract": "Pakistan is a developing nation that emphatically needs low cost energy resources to cope up with the economic growth. The major portion of energy is being generated by conventional methods. To generate energy through conventional methods is an expensive business that has direct impact on socio economic conditions corresponding to the rising of prices of energy in Pakistan. Another major implication of generation of energy by conventional source is increasing of circular debt that crossed Rs: 10 billion. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential of renewable energy resources and role of Government in policy formulation. The assessment showed that there is large availability of renewable energy resources. However, the formulated renewable energy policy does not have effect on the practical realization of renewable energy. This research study provides further insight owing to power policies, renewable energy transition and challenges of renewable energy policy facing in Pakistan. After potential assessment of renewable energy resources, the recommendations have been put forwarded that would help to promote renewable energy, as a key indicator in the sustainable growth and accelerating the energy transition to future energy perspectives of country.",

For these reasons, the state of health of population has become the object of studies and monitoring by many organizations and experts. In this study we try to analyze the short and long run relationship between neonatal mortality rate, economic growth, energy consumption (renewable and non-renewable), female literacy, and air pollution in India during 1970–2021 periods by using ARDL approach and VECM method. It appears that female literacy, economic growth and renewable energy consumption have an important role in reducing neonatal mortality rate. By contrast, non-renewable energy consumption, CO2 emissions and working mother's strongly increase neonatal mortality. From these results, Indian government is required to provide for the basic needs of mothers by guaranteeing her right to education and improving their standard of living. The Indian government should also reduce air pollution by launching projects, using clean and environmentally friendly energy, and constructing industrial areas away from population centers. Also, it is necessary to Also, it is necessary to reduce the dependance on energy sources polluting due to the high cost and instability of prices in the traditional energy market, as well as reducing of the global warming and the danger it poses to continuous heat and climate change.

This exploration/exploitation trade-off has been extensively studied in computer science and has been productively applied to multiple cognitive domains. In this chapter, this framework is extended to the ubiquitous alternation between two modes of serial thought: mind-wandering and goal-directed thought. The exploration/exploitation framework provides a new perspective on the functionality of mind-wandering and its pattern of regular switching with goal-directed thought. It also raises new hypotheses about the regulation of mind-wandering across time and differences in the propensity to mind-wander across individuals.",

Integrating low-carbon alternative energy, renewable energy sources (RES), is becoming very important for energy systems. Effective management of the integration of the production capacity of RES is as important as the production capacity of wind farms with the production capacity of fossil fuel power plants. This article analyzed 850,660 data recorded by a wind farm from March 01, 2020, 00:00:00 to December 31, t2020, 23:50:00 were analyzed. And by using machine learning and extra tree, light gradient boosting machine, gradient boosting regressor, decision tree, Ada Boost, and ridge algorithms, the production power of the wind farm was predicted. The best performance predicting the turbine production power was assigned to extra tree, and the worst performance was related to the Ridge algorithm. ",

        "abstract": " The stress sensitivity of a coal reservoir is an important factor affecting the productivity of the coalbed methane well. Determining methods to reduce the stress sensitivity of coal reservoirs in the process of coalbed methane well drainage and recovery is of significance for the efficient development of coalbed methane. Based on a multiindex comprehensive evaluation of the stress sensitivity of a lignite reservoir under different pH and salinity, a permeability prediction model and productivity model of the coalbed methane well are established in consideration of the stress sensitivity under the influence of pH and salinity. Analysis is conducted on changes in permeability with effective stress and the mechanism involved in the stress-sensitive effect in a lignite reservoir under these two influencing factors. Results show that the relation between dimensionless permeability and effective stress is in good agreement with a negative exponential relationship. In addition, the relation between the stress-sensitive coefficient and effective stress can be divided into a fluctuation stage and a stabilization stage using 15–17 MPa as the boundary. It is also apparent that an increase in salinity is beneficial for decreasing the stress sensitivity of a reservoir under alkaline conditions, but this effect gradually decreases with an increase in the pH. Salinity has less influence on stress sensitivity under acidic conditions. In terms of pH, which is bounded by critical salinity, a lower pH is beneficial for reservoir protection in low to intermediate salinity conditions. In contrast, when the pH is higher, the reservoir is better protected. Acidic conditions involve inorganic chemical reactions, whereas alkaline conditions involve organic–inorganic reactions, and the influence of salinity on permeability sensitivity is affected by the amount of H+.

        "abstract": " The Earth's infrared energy storage is substantial, and its large-scale utilization could effectively ameliorate the greenhouse effect on Earth. Several applications of utilizing Earth's infrared radiation for cooling and power generation are summarized based on existing literature. Building upon this foundation, the use of water as an excellent energy storage medium is proposed, and a long-wave energy storage system is designed. This system can harness the immense energy density of long-wave infrared radiation with fixed bandwidth or wavelength. A comprehensive study on large-scale application is outlined in four aspects, leveraging the energy storage and radiation advantages of the system: (a) Long-wave infrared is efficiently transported using hollow glass infrared fibers for room cooling and heating. This addresses the issues of separate terminals for capillary radiation air conditioning, high costs, and maintenance challenges. (b) Building on existing literature, taking Hainan as an example, the utilization of a temperature difference of approximately 15 °C between the lowest and highest temperatures in a day for power generation is suggested. (c) The composition and structure of planar antennas are derived, and parameter selection for rectifying diodes is proposed based on radiation fluctuation theory and antenna theory. This lays a theoretical and practical foundation for converting long-wave radiation waves using rectifying antennas. (d) The long-wave radiation quantum theory is utilized to propose the concept of manufacturing components that can directly convert energy from long-wave radiation. In each of these four aspects of large-scale utilization, the emphasis is on water's excellent insulation, storage, and radiation properties, presenting new perspectives for the widespread utilization of Earth's infrared and offering a quick pathway for humanity to explore new energy sources and mitigate the greenhouse effect on Earth, facilitating a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.

        "abstract": " In the context of electricity generation in the oil and gas producing countries, it has become implicit to develop new, clean, and renewable sources of energy to supplement the fossil fuel based power generation. With this single aim, one can hit two targets, conservation of fixed fossil fuel resources and combat the adverse climatic changes to safeguard our planet. In regional context, solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, wind power, geothermal, and hydro power are alternative sources for power mitigation. Of these renewables, wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), diesel, and energy storage in hybrid combinations are the possible ways to supply continuous energy for all sizes of applications. This paper provides a review of the existing hybrid power systems and the theoretical studies around the globe in varied climatological conditions to identify the best combinations of hybrid systems for Saudi Arabia to supplement the existing energy portfolio. The wind/solar-pv, wind/solar-pv/diesel, and solar-pv/diesel with and without battery backup are most commonly used systems with respective popularity of 28, 22, and 21%. Among users, remote communities are the highest while islands and communication towers are the next common applications. Average costs of energy of wind/solar-pv, wind/solar-pv/diesel, and solar-pv/diesel are around 0.458, 0.355, and 0.349 US$/kWh. ",

        "abstract": " Today renewable energy has become an absolute necessity taking into account the price of fossil energies and the pollution resulting from her large exploitation. Solar radiation can be converted directly into electrical energy, in the form of direct current, by means of a solar cell. Finding the maximum power point is an essential part in photovoltaic systems. Indeed, the output power varies greatly depending on illumination, temperature, but also the overall aging of the system. In order to operate a PV generator as often as possible at its optimum power, we must introduce a controller and a static converter which will act as an adapter between the source and the load. Many works review the different maximum power methods to adjust the optimal output power and improve the efficiency of the PV system. These methods are broadly classified into several categories. In this paper, such an experimental regulator based on a power mathematical technique is proposed, which is founded on least squares method to estimate the maximum power when operating sub-optimally. This technique makes it possible to compare experimental data, generally tainted with measurement errors, with a mathematical model supposed to write these data. This study gives the opportunity to experimentally test a mathematical method with a PV system which mainly uses a BOOST chopper. The DC / DC converter and the regulator are designed and produced within the research unit while using an STM32F4 microcontroller over sun. The results obtained from the use of this optimization technique clearly show the very high fidelity between the real values of the current and voltage and their optimal estimated values with a certain uncertainty which does not exceed almost 2%, which shows a good agreement. In the same way, this approach makes it possible to minimize the oscillations around the MPP, which already makes it possible to improve the efficiency of the system which is very close to 100% in experimental tests.

        "abstract": " Storage systems are needed to boost the reliability of intermittent solar and wind resources in power networks. Rather than focus on one storage system or one hybrid energy storage system (HESS), this work models the operation of six HESS configurations in a Renewable Energy (RE) based grid-tied network. The objective is to minimise the daily operational costs of the microgrid while prolonging the storage lifetime by considering storage degradation costs. The influence of fixed tariffs and time-of-use (TOU) tariffs on the optimal operational of the HESS configurations have also been investigated; as well as deferrable demand satisfaction, charge-discharge pattern of different HESS and availability of the power-dense storage system within the microgrid. Results show that the lead-acid battery and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) HESS incurs the highest operational costs, while the supercapacitor-lead-acid battery HESS incurs the lowest operational costs. The supercapacitor-lead acid battery and the supercapacitor-HFC HESS incur the highest annual storage degradation costs. The grid expenses were seen to be the same for all HESS under each tariff scheme. Lastly, decreasing the minimum storage level further by 10% from the 30% in the base case, led to an increase in the number of hours of availability of the power-dense storage system of five of the six HESS. These results have given a deeper understanding to the operation of HESS systems and can inform better decision making of the suitable HESS to be deployed in different operating scenarios. ",
