        "abstract": "Statistical learning methods have been growing in popularity in recent years. Many of these procedures have parameters that must be tuned for models to perform well. Research has been extensive in neural networks, but not for many other learning methods. We looked at the behavior of tuning parameters for support vector machines, gradient boosting machines, and adaboost in both a classification and regression setting. We used grid search to identify ranges of tuning parameters where good models can be found across many different datasets. We then explored different optimization algorithms to select a model across the tuning parameter space. Models selected by the optimization algorithm were compared to the best models obtained through grid search to select well performing algorithms. This information was used to create an R package, EZtune, that automatically tunes support vector machines and boosted trees.",

By exploiting some properties of the k-norm of a vector, namely, of the sum of its k largest absolute-value components, we formulate a sparse optimization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, whose continuous relaxation is equivalent to the unconstrained minimization of a difference-of-convex function. The approach is applied to Feature Selection in the support vector machine framework, and tested on a set of benchmark instances. Numerical comparisons against both the standard $$\\ell _1$$\n\nℓ\n1\n\n-based support vector machine and a simple version of the Slope method are presented, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving high sparsity level of the solutions without impairing test-correctness.",

The success of computer-aided diagnosis methods depends on the method used; dataset, pre-processing, post-processing, etc. differ according to the processes. In this study, parameter optimization of support vector machines was performed with four different methods currently used in the literature to assist the physician in diagnosis. The success of each method was tested on two different Parkinson’s datasets and the results were compared within themselves and with the literature. According to the results obtained, the highest accuracy rates vary depending on the dataset and optimization method. While Improved Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization achieved high success in the first dataset, Bat Algorithm achieved higher success in the other dataset. While the successful results obtained are better than some studies in the literature, they are at a level that can compete with some studies.",

        "abstract": "Based on the hypothesis that multi-corner and multi-cell structures can effectively improve energy absorption behavior, this paper designed a multi-cell circumferentially corrugated tube (MCCT) for energy absorption. The MCCT was designed as a variable thickness form to study the influence of the materials distribution on the cross section on energy absorption. The energy absorption performance of the MCCT was investigated under impact condition with finite element simulation validated by a drop hammer test. Support vector machine, a machine learning technique, was used to predict the energy absorption performance and was further used for optimization of the MCCT. The results show that under the same mass, the MCCT with variable decreasing wall thickness (corners thicker than other regions) shows 4.81%, 30.67% and 37.70% improvement, respectively, in PCF, SEA and CFE, compared to the MCCT with variable increasing wall thickness (corners thinner than other regions). Moreover, the optimization results show that most samples in Pareto front lie in the region of tc > tm. These results all indicate that the MCCT with variable decreasing wall thickness performs better than with increasing wall thickness with regards energy absorption. In conclusion, arranging more materials in the corner element area can effectively improve the energy absorption characteristics of the thin-walled tube. This paper highlights the importance of designing thin-walled tubes as multi-corner and variable thickness configurations for energy absorption.",

        "abstract": "Future generations of flight control systems, such as those for unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), are likely to be more adaptive and intelligent to cope with the extra safety and reliability requirements due to pilotless operations. An efficient fault detection and isolation (FDI) system is paramount and should be capable of monitoring the health status of an aircraft. Historically, hardware redundancy techniques have been used to detect faults. However, duplicating the actuators in an UAV is not ideal due to the high cost and large mass of additional components. Fortunately, aircraft actuator faults can also be detected using analytical redundancy techniques. In this study, a data-driven algorithm using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is designed. The aircraft actuator fault investigated is the loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) fault. The aim of the fault detection algorithm is to classify the feature vector data into a nominal or faulty class based on the health of the actuator. The results show that the SVM algorithm detects the LOE fault almost instantly, with an average accuracy of 99%.",

        "abstract": "AbstractOver the last few decades, computer and internet security has become a vital area because of eye‐opening numbers of data breaches, intruders on perilous infrastructure and malware attacks that are increasing day by day. In order to monitor abnormal activities and identify unusual attacks, several security solutions have been proposed in the recent past years. To protect computer system, intrusion detection system (IDS) opens up great opportunities to determine vulnerabilities and detect anomalies in security system. For detecting new attacks or building security solutions, in this study we present a new wrapper technique for security specialists that can help to detect more complicated attacks by combining teaching learning‐based optimization with opposition learning scheme and simulated annealing method. In order to address advance attack, firstly opposition learning strategy is used to update population generation of teaching learning‐based optimization that affect the robustness of the model after that simulated annealing is integrated into the teaching learning‐based optimization. In proposed method to choose the relevant features, we have used support vector machine as a fitness function that can be helped to recognize attacks precisely. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three popular datasets namely NSL‐KDD, ISCX 2012 and UNSW‐NB15. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other existing wrapper algorithms in terms of detection rate, accuracy and false alarm rates.",

Such as automatic detection and prediction of diseases and obtaining medical results by applying artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning algorithms to clinical data. Therefore, because coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most prevalent types of diseases in the world and with the highest rate of injuries, one of the machine learning algorithms will be used in this research to diagnose this disease through artificial intelligence. Patient clinical factors were used, a data set of 303 people. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used and applied to the clinical factors of patients, which are 56 variables, as they are considered one of the most important clinical factors that can be used to detect CAD. This algorithm is considered to have good predictive ability in medical clinical characteristics. The Support Vector Machine algorithm model, which was used in this research, provided the highest prediction accuracy of (96.7%), with an AUC value of (71.5%). This indicates the effectiveness of the SVM algorithm in classifying the clinical patient data set that was adopted in this research. After applying it to the research data set, the SVM algorithm showed its ability to classify and predict well. The accuracy of the algorithm model was (96.7%). This indicates that this algorithm can help cardiologists in different ways during their daily practices to predict coronary artery disease, which is one of the most common heart diseases.",

        "abstract": "Quantum support vector machines employ quantum circuits to define the kernel function. It has been shown that this approach offers a provable exponential speedup compared to any known classical algorithm for certain data sets. The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in O(M4.67/&#x03B5;2) quantum circuit evaluations, where M denotes the size of the data set and &#x03B5; the solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values, which is only obtainable in theory. We prove under an empirically motivated assumption that the kernelized primal problem can alternatively be solved in O(min{M2/&#x03B5;6,1/&#x03B5;10}) evaluations by employing a generalization of a known classical algorithm called Pegasos. Accompanying empirical results demonstrate these analytical complexities to be essentially tight. In addition, we investigate a variational approximation to quantum support vector machines and show that their heuristic training achieves considerably better scaling in our experiments.",

        "abstract": "Modern industrial machine applications often contain data collection functions through automation systems or external sensors. Yet, while the different data collection mechanisms might be effortless to construct, it is advised to have a well-balanced consideration of the possible data inputs based on the machine characteristics, usage, and operational environment. Prior consideration of the collected data parameters reduces the risk of excessive data, yet another challenge remains to distinguish meaningful features significant for the purpose. This research illustrates a peripheral milling machine data collection and data pre-processing approach to diagnose significant machine parameters relevant to milling blade wear. The experiences gained from this research encourage conducting pre-categorisation of data significant for the purpose, those being manual setup data, programmable logic controller (PLC) automation system data, calculated parameters, and measured parameters under this study. Further, the results from the raw data pre-processing phase performed with Pearson Correlation Coefficient and permutation feature importance methods indicate that the most dominant correlation to recognised wear characteristics in the case machine context is perceived with vibration excitation monitoring. The root mean square (RMS) vibration signal is further predicted by using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to test the SVR’s overall suitability for the asset’s health index (HI) approximation. It was found that the SVR algorithm has sufficient data parameter behaviour forecast capabilities to be used in the peripheral milling machine prognostic process and its development. The SVR with Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel receives the highest scoring metrics; therefore, outperforming the linear and polynomial kernels compared as part of the study.",

        "abstract": "Here, a novel hybrid method of intelligent fault identification within complex mechanical systems was proposed using parallel-factor (PARAFAC) theory and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) for a support vector machine (SVM). The parallel-factor multi-scale analysis theory was studied to reconstruct tensor feature information based on a three-dimensional matrix for time, frequency, and spatial vectors. A multi-scale wavelet analysis was used to transform the original multi-channel experimental data acquired from a gearbox into a three-dimensional feature matrix of the multi-level structure. The optimal correspondence among the two-dimensional feature signals in the frequency and time domains for the different fault modes was established by the PARAFAC theory. An intelligent APSO algorithm was developed to obtain the optimal parameter structures of an SVM classifier. A comparison with the existing time–frequency analysis method showed that the proposed hybrid PARAFAC-PSO-SVM diagnosis model effectively eliminated the redundant information in the multi-dimensional tensor features but retained the important components. The PARAFAC-APSO-SVM hybrid diagnostic model achieved fast, accurate, and simple fault-classification and identification results, and could provide theoretical support for the application of the PARAFAC theory to complex mechanical fault diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number of Electrical Vehicles (EVs) will bring difficulties in the management of charging process and pose serious grid problems at low voltage levels. Particularly, with employment of wireless power transfer (WPT) system in a charging station, harmonic interference will increase. The main reason of that poor power quality lies on high frequency square wave output of transmitter side of WPT. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to design an optimal C-type passive filter in order to mitigate voltage and current total harmonic distortions (THD) of WPT system. Hereby, SVM-based model is constructed which consists of THD indices and power factor (PF) as outputs whereas filter parameters are inputs. The main aim of optimization process is minimization of distortions and correction of PF while searching the filter parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to find the optimal filter parameters. To show the efficiency of proposed method, simulation studies are carried out on Matlab®/SimulinkTM environment. It is observed that voltage total harmonic distortion (THDv) and current total harmonic distortion (THDi) are calculated as 1.03%, 2.23%, respectively, and the power factor is improved to 0.995% when the designed C-type filter is utilized.",

This surge in attention is particularly pronounced in the realm of quantum machine learning (QML) following a classical trend. Here we start with a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs). Subsequently, we analyze the limitations inherent in both annealing and gate-based techniques. To address these identified weaknesses, we propose a novel hybrid methodology that integrates aspects of both techniques, thereby mitigating several individual drawbacks while keeping the advantages. We provide a detailed presentation of the two components of our hybrid models, accompanied by the presentation of experimental results that corroborate the efficacy of the proposed architecture. These results pave the way for a more integrated paradigm in quantum machine learning and quantum computing at large, transcending traditional compartmentalization.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe evolvement in digital media and information technology over the past decades have purveyed the internet to be an effectual medium for the exchange of data and communication. With the advent of technology, the data has become susceptible to mismanagement and exploitation. This led to the emergence of Internet Security frameworks like Information hiding and detection. Examples of domains of Information hiding and detection are Steganography and steganalysis respectively. This work focus on addressing possible security breaches using Internet security framework like Information hiding and techniques to identify the presence of a breach. The work involves the use of Blind steganalysis technique with the concept of Machine Learning incorporated into it. The work is done using the Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) format because of its wide use for transmission over the Internet. Stego (embedded) images are created for evaluation by randomly embedding a text message into the image. The concept of calibration is used to retrieve an estimate of the cover (clean) image for analysis. The embedding is done with four different steganographic schemes in both spatial and transform domain namely LSB Matching and LSB Replacement, Pixel Value Differencing and F5. After the embedding of data with random percentages, the first order, the second order, the extended Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Markov features are extracted for steganalysis.The above features are a combination of interblock and intra block dependencies. They had been considered in this paper to eliminate the drawback of each one of them, if considered separately. Dimensionality reduction is applied to the features using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Block based technique had been used in the images for better accuracy of results. The technique of machine learning is added by using classifiers to differentiate the stego image from a cover image. A comparative study had been during with the classifier names Support Vector Machine and its evolutionary counterpart using Particle Swarm Optimization. The idea of cross validation had also been used in this work for better accuracy of results. Further parameters used in the process are the four different types of sampling namely linear, shuffled, stratified and automatic and the six different kernels used in classification specifically dot, multi-quadratic, epanechnikov, radial and ANOVA to identify what combination would yield a better result.",

ISVM is an extension of traditional support vector machines (SVM) designed to handle scenarios where new data points become available over time. The dataset includes handwritten images (numbers “0” to “6”) and trials introducing new classes (“7”, “8”, and “9”). Evaluation utilizes k-fold cross-validation for robustness. Digital image processing involves converting images into numeric data using the histogram method. The result showed the positive outcomes of using ISVM in handwritten digit recognition, emphasizing its adaptability to incremental learning and its ability to maintain robust performance in the face of evolving datasets, which is crucial for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "The fault diagnosis of a gearbox is crucial to ensure its safe operation. Entropy has become a common tool for measuring the complexity of time series. However, entropy bias may occur when the data are not long enough or the scale becomes larger. This paper proposes a gearbox fault diagnosis method based on Refined Time-Shifted Multiscale Reverse Dispersion Entropy (RTSMRDE), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), and the Sparrow Search Algorithm Support Vector Machine (SSA-SVM). First, the proposed RTSMRDE was used to calculate the multiscale fault features. By incorporating the refined time-shift method into Multiscale Reverse Dispersion Entropy (MRDE), errors that arose during the processing of complex time series could be effectively reduced. Second, the t-SNE algorithm was utilized to extract sensitive features from the multiscale, high-dimensional fault features. Finally, the low-dimensional feature matrix was input into SSA-SVM for fault diagnosis. Two gearbox experiments showed that the diagnostic model proposed in this paper had an accuracy rate of 100%, and the proposed model performed better than other methods in terms of diagnostic performance.",

Firstly, the spatial correlation analysis is conducted on the distributed PV stations. The k‐means clustering method based on morphological similarity distance improvement and mutual information function is used to select the best reference station and the best delay, which generates strongly correlated PV sequences. Then, a hybrid algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) in a competitive framework (HCPSO) is proposed, aiming to fuse the fast convergence capability of PSO algorithm with the global search capability of SCA algorithm, while enabling the algorithm to effectively handle high‐dimensional optimization problems based on a competitive mechanism. Finally, the HCPSO algorithm is combined with SVM algorithm, which expands the applicable scenarios of the SVM model and effectively improves the accuracy of PV short‐term prediction.",

To perform the identification and classification of various cancer types, in this paper, two techniques are adopted. The optimized feature set computation was done using the Kernel-Induced Matriarch path tracking Elephant Herding Optimization (KIM-EHO) and the classification for the given samples was done using the Support Vector Machines (SVM).

One of the utilization of twitter is to analyze the sentiment of the online marketplace which can be used to determine the service, quality of goods, and delivery of goods on a product, service or application. This research aims to categorize the reviews or responses of the Indonesian people, especially to the online marketplace using the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. In order to make continuous improvements to the role of the Indonesian online marketplace in the future, sentiment analysis is needed. The analysis research tweets used were 4165 datasets using the python programming language. Sentiment analysis research stages include data collection, preprocessing, labeling, tf-idf weighting, split data, SVM model analysis and result evaluation. The data is then divided into 80% training data and 20% testing data, 50% training data and 50% testing data, 20% training data and 80% testing data. The results of the svm algorithm testing scenario obtained the highest optimization with an accuracy value of 97%, F1-score value on positive labels 88% and negative 98%, also obtained a positive recall value of 80% and negative 100% precision value on positive labels 98% and negative 97%, on 80% training data and 20% testing. It can be concluded that in this case, the linear svm algorithm is able to work to recognize models with a high level of accuracy so that in the future it can be used in similar cases.",

Medical data classification is regarded as the challenging task to develop intelligent medical decision support systems in hospitals. In this paper, the ensemble approaches based on support vector machines are proposed for classifying medical data. This research’s key contribution is that the ensemble multiple support vector machines use the function kernel in the style of gradient boosting and bagging to produce a more accurate fusion model than the mono-modality models. Extensive experiments have been conducted on forty benchmark medical datasets from the University of California at Irvine machine learning repository. The classification results show that there is a statistically significant difference (p-values < 0.05) between the proposed approaches and the best classification models. In addition, the empirical analysis of forty medical datasets indicated that our models can predict diseases with an accuracy rate of 82.82 and 81.76 percent without feature selection in the preprocessing data stage.",

This will lead us to observe how close both algorithms are from the viewpoint of the precision results that are high enough, in tune with the purpose of this study is high enough (very precise), and will be the problem to be solved, the one that finally determines the choice of the algorithm.",

It reduces the time and expenses incurred by farmers and ensures that end users receive high-quality products. This study details the process for identifying dry beans. We employed a support vector machine (SVM) model and three optimization techniques: Bayesian optimization, random search optimization, and grid search optimization. This study aimed to determine the optimal optimization technique for identifying dry beans using an SVM model. Various metrics, including the validation accuracy, test accuracy, total validation cost, total test cost, and minimum classification error, were computed and analyzed to compare the performance of each optimization method. In comparison, Bayesian optimization was determined to be the most effective optimization technique for identifying dry beans, with a validation accuracy of 93.06%, test accuracy of 92.29%, and minimum classification error of 0.069384.</span>",

        "abstract": "Improving the prediction accuracy of aerospace engine production line yields is of significant importance for enhancing production efficiency and optimizing production scheduling in enterprises. To address this, a novel method called Convolutional Neural Networks-Improved Support Vector Regression (CNN-ISVR) has been proposed for predicting the production line yield of aerospace engines. The method first divides the factors influencing production line yield into production cycle and real-time status information of the production line and then analyzes the key feature factors. To solve the problem of poor prediction performance in traditional SVR models due to the subjective selection of kernel function parameters, an improved SVR model is presented. This approach combines the elite strategy genetic algorithm with the hyperparameter optimization method based on grid search and cross-validation to obtain the best penalty factor and kernel function width of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function. The extracted features of production data are then used for prediction by inputting them into the improved support vector regression model, based on a shallow CNN without dimensionality reduction. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the CNN-ISVR model is evaluated using the three commonly used evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). The model’s prediction results are then compared to those of other models. The CNN-ISVR hybrid model is shown to outperform other models in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "The Bayesian support vector regression (BSVR) metamodel is widely used in various engineering fields to analyze the uncertainty arising from uncertain parameters. However, the accuracy of the BSVR metamodel based on the traditional one-shot sampling method fails to meet the requirements of the uncertainty analysis of complex systems. To this end, an error-pursing adaptive uncertainty analysis method based on the BSVR metamodel is presented by combining a new adaptive sampling scheme. This new sampling scheme was improved by a new error-pursuing active learning function that is named, herein, adjusted mean square error (AMSE), which guides the adaptive sampling of the BSVR metamodel’s design of experiments (DoE). During the sampling process, AMSE combines mean square error and leave-one-out cross-validation error to estimate the prediction error of the metamodel in the entire design space. Stepwise refinement of the metamodel was achieved by placing the sampled regions at locations with large prediction errors. Six benchmark analytical functions featuring different dimensions were used to validate the proposed method. The effectiveness of the method was then further illustrated by a more realistic application of an overhung rotor system.",

However, as machine learning techniques have improved, we now have the freedom to look for the right solution. For example, we now have sophisticated information processing systems that can predict whether a patient has polygenic disease or not. Additionally, anticipating the illness early results in giving the patients what they need before it becomes urgent.Goals of this analysis is to develop a system which predicts the diabetes risk level of patient.The experimental results shows that the prediction of diabetes done at high accuracy using support vector machines.\nKEYWORDS: Early Detection, Machine Learning, SVM(Support Vector Machines), Accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The traditional power transformer diagnosis method relies on a lot of experience knowledge and a complex sampling process, which brings great difficulties to the fault diagnosis work. To solve this problem, a fault feature extraction method based on fully adaptive noise set empirical mode decomposition (CEEMDAN) is proposed, and the hunter–prey optimization (HPO) algorithm is used to optimize the support vector machine (SVM) to identify and classify the voice print faults of power transformers. Firstly, the CEEMDAN algorithm is used to decompose the voicemarks into several IMF components. IMF components containing fault information are selected according to the envelope kurtosis index and reconstructed to generate new signal sequences. PCA dimensionality reduction is performed on the reconstructed signal, and the principal components are extracted with a high cumulative contribution rate as input to SVM. Then, the HPO-SVM algorithm is used to classify and identify transformer faults. Apply the proposed method to the diagnosis of typical faults in power transformers. The results show that the accuracy of this method in identifying various fault states of power transformers can reach 98.5%, and it has better classification performance than other similar methods.",

        "abstract": " The [Formula: see text]-insensitive-Least Squares Support Vector Regression ([Formula: see text]-LSSVR) optimization problem with [Formula: see text]-insensitive quadratic loss function is a non-smooth, piecewise quadratic complex problem. Therefore, the optimal solution of [Formula: see text]-LSSVR takes longer than Classic LSSVR. Additionally, due to its unbounded influence function, [Formula: see text]-LSSVR, like classical LSSVR, shows poor generalization ability in the presence of outliers. To overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks, this paper presents an [Formula: see text]-insensitive Weighted Least Squares Support Vector Regression ([Formula: see text]-WLSSVR) with equality constraints to increase robustness against outliers. To reduce the computational complexity and time, the optimization problem of [Formula: see text]-WLSSVR is solved by the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. Extensive simulations have shown that the presented [Formula: see text]-WLSSVR model combined with the SMO algorithm is more effective and efficient than LSSVR and its known sparse variants. ",

        "abstract": "Floods can cause negative impacts in various aspects, starting from economic, social, to health aspects. Even quoted from the site gis.bnpb.go.id, during 2022, there have been 1031 cases of flood disasters in Indonesia. Meanwhile in Jakarta, in 2022 there have been 14 cases of floods that caused hundreds of people to lose their homes. Several approaches can be taken to determine public opinion about flooding, one of which is text mining with an analysis of community sentiment. Sentiment analysis aims to determine public opinion regarding flood management in the capital city of Jakarta based on positive, neutral, and negative categories. To get the public sentiment, researchers carried out several stages, including the preprocessing stage. After obtaining public sentiment regarding flood management through the preprocessing stage, then classification is carried out based on public opinion so that it can be used by related parties for evaluation material in flood handling. In this study, the classification method used is the SVM method which is one of the supervised learning methods in machine learning. After classification, the next stage is the testing process using the K-Fold Cross Validation method. From the various sentiments obtained from Twitter data, it can be concluded that there are around 414 positive sentiments and 2464 negative sentiments related to flood handling in DKI Jakarta, while the results obtained from the test results show that the accuracy reaches 88.6%, the precision reaches 88.6% and recall reached 89.4%.",

Therefore, it is a challenge for binary classification to imbalanced data, to address this, this paper proposes a novel twin-support vector machine method. The thought is that majority classes and minority classes are found by two support vector machines, respectively. The new kernel is derived to promote the learning ability of the two support vector machines. Results show that the proposed method wins over competing methods in classification performance and the ability to find minority classes. Those classifiers based-twin architectures have more advantages than those classifiers based-single architecture in classification ability. We demonstrate that the complexity of imbalanced data distribution has negative effects on classification results, whereas, the advanced classification results and the desired boundaries can be gained by optimizing the kernel.",

However, there are often cases of mistargeting of social assistance programs by the government. Improper data management and Data Terpadu Kesejahteraan Sosial (DTKS) which are not used as the cause of the distribution of social assistance are not well targeted. The data can be analyzed using the classification method to determine whether or not the family accepts the ban from the government. This study classifies the SUSENAS data by comparing K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The advantage of the KNN method lies in the level of accuracy to solve problems with large data while the SVM method has better performance in various fields of application such as bioinformacs, handwriting recognition, text classification and so on. Based on training data and testing data comparison 85%:15% showed that KNN method had a better classification performance than the SVM method. The accuracy value of KNN method is 80,95% higher than the accuracy value of SVM method is 78,79%.",

Focusing on the importance of personal credit scoring in today's credit dynamics, the article explores SVM's versatility in various domains through a literature review. The theoretical background underscores the unique approach and computational efficiency of SVM. The optimization strategy encompasses four critical aspects: debt solvency, earning potential, operational prowess, and growth capability using metrics such as asset-liability ratios. Experimental validation with credit card datasets from Australia and Germany illustrates the nuanced relationship between different K-values and performance metrics, and demonstrates the adaptability of SVM in improving credit scoring. In short, the article presents an original, comprehensive approach to credit risk management that integrates theoretical foundations, literature findings, and empirical experiments to improve the accuracy of credit scoring in the dynamic economic landscaper.",

        "abstract": "The design of linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification techniques is generally a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP). These classification techniques require finding appropriate trade-offs between two objectives, such as the amount of misclassified training data (classification error) and the number of non-zero elements of the separator hyperplane. In this article, we review several linear SVM classification models in the form of multi-objective optimization. We put particular emphasis on applying sparse optimization (in terms of minimization of the number of non-zero elements of the separator hyperplane) to Feature Selection (FS) for multi-objective optimization linear SVM. Our primary purpose is to demonstrate the advantages of considering linear SVM classification techniques as MOPs. In multi-objective cases, we can obtain a set of Pareto optimal solutions instead of one optimal solution in single-objective cases. The results of these linear SVMs are reported on some classification datasets. The test problems are specifically designed to challenge the number of non-zero components of the normal vector of the separator hyperplane. We used these datasets for multi-objective and single-objective models.",

        "abstract": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm widely used for classification tasks. In contrast to traditional methods that split the data into separate training and testing sets, here we propose an innovative approach where subsets of the original data are randomly selected to train the model multiple times. This iterative training process aims to identify a representative data subset, leading to improved inferences about the population. Additionally, we introduce a novel distance-based kernel specifically designed for binary-type features based on a similarity matrix that efficiently handles both binary and multi-class classification problems. Computational experiments on publicly available datasets of varying sizes demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the distance-based kernel achieves superior performance compared to other well-known kernels from the literature and those used in previous studies on the same datasets. These findings validate the effectiveness of our proposed classification method and distance-based kernel for SVMs. By leveraging random subset selection and a unique kernel design, we achieve notable improvements in classification accuracy. These results have significant implications for diverse classification problems in Machine Learning and data analysis.",

Finally, the structural model evaluation index system of teachers’ teaching ability is constructed, and the current teaching ability development of college teachers in a province is studied and analyzed from two perspectives of teachers’ self-assessment and students’ evaluation based on multimodal emotional features of support vector machine. The results showed that in terms of teaching ability dimensions, teachers had the highest expectation of their teaching ability (4.38) in each dimension, followed in order by teachers’ self-evaluation of teaching ability (4.15), students’ expectation (4.05), and students’ evaluation of teachers’ teaching ability (3.56) was the lowest. This study reveals that teachers’ perceptions of the teaching competencies they should have are biased, and their awareness of self-development is insufficient from the emotional characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that develops in the glands present on the lining of the organs in the human body. It is found that histopathological images, obtained as a result of biopsy, are the most definitive way of diagnosing cancer. The main objective of this work is to use deep learning techniques for the detection and classification of adenocarcinoma using histopathological images of lung and colon tissues with minimal preprocessing. Two approaches have been utilized. The first method entails creating two CNN architectures: CNN with a Softmax classifier (AdenoCanNet) and CNN with an SVM classifier (AdenoCanSVM). The second approach corresponds to training some of the prominent existing architecture such as VGG16, VGG19, LeNet, and ResNet50. The study aims at understanding the performance of various architectures in diagnosing using histopathological images with cases taken separately and taken together, with a full dataset and a subset of the dataset. The LC25000 dataset used consists of 25,000 histopathological images, having both cancerous and normal images from both the lung and colon regions of the human body. The accuracy metric was taken as the defining parameter for determining and comparing the performance of various architectures undertaken during the study. A comparison between the several models used in the study is presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "AbstractNeural networks and related deep learning methods are currently at the leading edge of technologies used for classifying complex objects such as seismograms. However they generally demand large amounts of time and data for model training and their learned models can sometimes be difficult to interpret. FastMapSVM is an interpretable machine learning framework for classifying complex objects, combining the complementary strengths of FastMap with support vector machines (SVMs) and extending the applicability of SVMs to domains with complex objects. FastMap is an efficient linear-time algorithm that maps complex objects to points in a Euclidean space while preserving pairwise domain-specific distances between them. Here we invoke FastMapSVM as a lightweight alternative to neural networks for classifying seismograms. We demonstrate that FastMapSVM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for classifying seismograms when train data or time is limited. We also show that FastMapSVM can provide an insightful visualization of seismogram clustering behaviour and thus earthquake classification boundaries. We expect FastMapSVM to be viable for classification tasks in many other real-world domains.",

The projections of the vectors onto the relevant subspaces are analyzed using the present classifier. Any text classification method based on binary classification can use CIL as a universal framework for implementation.

        "abstract": "Cost, time, and development effort can increase due to errors in analyzing functional and non-functional software requirements. To minimize these errors, previous research has tried to classify software requirements, especially non-functional requirements, on the PROMISE dataset using the Bag of Words (BoW) feature extraction and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. On the other hand, the unbalanced distribution of class labels tends to decrease the evaluation result. Moreover, most software requirements are usually functional requirements. Therefore, there is a tendency for classifier models to classify test data as functional requirements. Previous research has performed class balancing on a dataset to handle unbalanced data. The study can achieve better classification evaluation results. Based on the previous research, this study proposes to combine the class balancing method and the SVM algorithm. K-fold cross-validation is used to optimize the training and test data to be more consistent in developing the SVM model. Tests were carried out on the value of K in k-fold, i.e., 5, 10, and 15. Results are measured by accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recall. The Public Requirements (PURE) dataset has been used in this research. Results show that SVM with class balancing can classify software requirements more accurately than SVM without class balancing. Random Over Sampling is the class balancing method with the highest evaluation score for classifying software requirements on SVM. The results showed an improvement in the average value of accuracy, f1 score, precision, and recall in SVM by 22.07%, 19.67%, 17.73%, and 19.67%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Schizophrenia is a form of psychosis which is prevalent within the population and affects both adults and adolescents, where it has also been noted that the conventional means towards diagnosing the disorder involve a high degree of subjectivity, can yield false positive results and are overall difficult to replicate. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) brain waves has been seen to carry promise as a means towards a non-invasive diagnosis of brain states via the acquisition of the bioelectrical manifestation of neuronal activities from across the skull. The acquisition of EEG signals involves a high number of electrode channels alongside the extraction of a relatively broad number of signal features which ultimately yields a high dimensional vector that scales upwards with the addition of data from subsequent subjects.     Methods: As a means around dealing with this issue, this paper proposes a combination of signal decomposition prior to feature extraction, alongside dimensionality reduction, to obtain a low dimensional representation and embedding which is sufficient to allow for an improved prediction performance with a low dimensional projection capable of distinguishing between schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic adolescents.     Results: The results from the pilot carried out, showed that a combination of a metaheuristic signal decomposition, linear dimensionality reduction and the long short-term memory deep learning model provided the best classification performance for the recognition of adolescent schizophrenia from a 1-dimensional embedding representation with a prediction accuracy of 88%.     Conclusion: Further work in this area would now look into the application of probabilistic modelling as a means towards inferring an associated stage of the schizophrenia psychosis where predicted to be present in an adolescent subject.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this work, we develop computationally efficient methods for deterministic production optimization under nonlinear constraints using a kernel-based machine learning method where the cost function is the net present value (NPV). We use the least-squares support-vector regression (LSSVR) to maximize the NPV function. To achieve computational efficiency, we generate a set of output values of the NPV and nonlinear constraint functions, which are field liquid production rate (FLPR) and water production rate (FWPR) in this study, by running the high-fidelity simulator for a broad set of input design variables (well controls) and then using the collection of input/output data to train LS-SVR proxy models to replace the high-fidelity simulator to compute NPV and nonlinear constraint functions during iterations of sequential quadratic programming (SQP). To obtain improved (higher) estimated optimal NPV values, we use the existing so-called iterative sampling refinement (ISR) method to update the LSSVR proxy so that the updated proxy remains predictive toward promising regions of search space during the optimization. Direct and indirect ways of constructing LSSVR-based NPVs as well as different combinations of input data, including nonlinear state constraints and/or the bottomhole pressures (BHPs) and water injection rates, are tested as feature space. The results obtained from our proposed LS-SVR-based optimization methods are compared with those obtained from our in-house StoSAG-based line-search SQP programming (LS-SQP-StoSAG) algorithm using directly a high-fidelity simulator to compute the gradients with StoSAG for the Brugge reservoir model. The results show that nonlinear constrained optimization with the LSSVR ISR with SQP is computationally an order of magnitude more efficient than LS-SQP-StoSAG. In addition, the results show that constructing NPV indirectly using the field liquid and water rates for a waterflooding problem where inputs come from LSSVR proxies of the nonlinear state constraints requires significantly fewer training samples than the method constructing NPV directly from the NPVs computed from a high-fidelity simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows the means of efficient use of a kernel-based machine learning method based on the predictor information alone to perform efficiently life-cycle production optimization with nonlinear state constraints.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, condition monitoring of wind turbines has been performed manually by certified rope teams. This method of inspection can be dangerous for the personnel involved, and the resulting downtime can be expensive. Wind turbine inspection can be performed using autonomous drones to achieve lower downtime, cost, and health risks. To enable autonomy, the field of drone path planning can be assisted by this research, namely machine learning that detects wind turbines present in aerial RGB images taken by the drone before performing the maneuvering for turbine inspection. For this task, the effectiveness of two deep learning architectures is evaluated in this paper both without and with a proposed fuzzy contrast enhancement (FCE) image preprocessing algorithm. Efforts are focused on two convolutional neural network (CNN) variants: VGG19 and Xception. A more traditional approach involving support vector machines (SVM) is also included to contrast a machine learning approach with our deep learning networks. The authors created a novel dataset of 4500 RGB images of size 210×210 to train and evaluate the performance of these networks on wind turbine detection. The dataset is captured in an environment mimicking that of a wind turbine farm, and consists of two classes of images: with and without a small-scale wind turbine (12V Primus Air Max) assembled at Utah Valley University. The images were used to describe in detail the analysis and implementation of the VGG19, Xception, and SVM algorithms using different optimization, model training, and hyperparameter tuning technologies. The performances of these three algorithms are compared in depth alongside those augmented using the proposed FCE image preprocessing technique.",

        "abstract": " This article examines the validity of the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in the context of the Nifty stock market index by applying a support vector machine (SVM) model. The aim is to forecast future stock prices using historical data and to evaluate the performance of the SVM model based on accuracy, precision, recall and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The findings offer important implications for the efficiency of the Nifty market and its consequences for investors. The EMH posits that stock prices incorporate all available information, making it impossible to consistently beat the market using historical data. This article tests this proposition by using an SVM model to forecast future stock prices using historical data. The methodology consists of applying the SVM algorithm on historical data of the Nifty stock market index. Performance measures, such as accuracy, precision, recall and AUC, are used to assess the effectiveness of the SVM model. The results show an accuracy of 63.25% in forecasting stock prices, indicating a substantial agreement between predicted and actual labels. The precision score of the model is 97.97%, indicating a high proportion of correctly predicted positive instances. However, the recall score is relatively low at 34.36%, suggesting that some actual positive instances were overlooked. The ROC curve visually illustrates the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate for different classification thresholds. This article contributes to the literature on market efficiency by applying a novel SVM model to forecast future stock prices of the Nifty index and finding that the model outperforms random chance, thus challenging the weak form of the EMH.

The presence and location of a small perturbation, induced by placing a lumped mass of 5 g on the plate, are determined by processing the optical fiber sensor data through support vector machine (SVM) classifiers trained with experimental data.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe objective of this work is to present an efficient method based on gradient-based optimization using a least-squares support-vector regression (LS-SVR) model to solve well-shutoff and well-control optimization problems. We formulate a continuous differentiable NPV for the well shutoff optimization problem. In our approach, switching well on/off times are considered part of the design variables. Our parameterization is based on a fixed number of cycles, the length of each cycle, and the production time fraction in each cycle. The remaining fraction of each cycle is the shutoff time fraction. We use linear equality constraints so that the summation of the length of each cycle is equal to the life of the production, and thus, we do not need to truncate the length of the last cycle. We consider both the stochastic simplex gradient optimization and the machine learning-based least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) proxy but we update it during optimization so that the updated proxy remains predictive toward promising regions of search space during the optimization. We compare the performance of the proposed method using the LS-SVR runs coupled with iterative sampling refinement method (ISR) to update the proxy during optimization with the popular stochastic simplex approximate gradient (StoSAG) and reservoir- simulations runs for a synthetic example considering a waterflooding process in a conventional compositional oil reservoir with 2 water injectors and 4 producers. Results show that higher computational efficiency is achieved using the LS-SVR-based optimization method over the StoSAG-based optimization method using a high-fidelity numerical simulator. The proposed LS-SVR-based framework is shown to be at least 3 to 7 times computationally more efficient, depending on the cases considered than the StoSAG using a high-fidelity numerical simulator. For the waterflooding optimization example, designing multiple shutoffs and making cycle length unknown are found to be not beneficial as compared to single shutoff cases as they yield lower NPVs than single shutoff cases. However, we observe that the size and sampling of the training data, as well as the selection of bound constraints for the well controls, influence the performance of the LS-SVR-based optimization method. The well-shutoff/well-control optimization problem can be handled with the gradient-based optimization methods by introducing a production time fraction as the design variable for each cycle. This is the first LSSVR application for the well shutoff and well-control optimization problem. The proposed LS-SVR-based optimization framework has great potential to be used as an efficient tool for this type of optimization problem.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a weighted composite approach for grey relational analysis (GRA) that utilizes a numerical weather prediction (NWP) and support vector machine (SVM). The approach is optimized using an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) algorithm. Initially, the dimension of NWP data is decreased by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), then the weight of sample coefficients is calculated by entropy-weight method (EWM), and the weighted grey relational of data points is calculated for different weather numerical time series data. At the same time, a new weighted composite grey relational degree is formed by combining the weighted cosine similarity of NWP values of the historical day and to be measured day. The SVM’s regression power prediction model is constructed by the time series data. To improve the accuracy of the system’s predictions, the grey relational time series data is chosen as the input variable for the SVM, and the influence parameters of the ideal SVM are discovered using the IGWO technique. According to the simulated prediction and analysis based on NWP, it can be observed that the proposed method in this study significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the data. Specifically, evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), regression correlation coefficient (r 2), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) all show corresponding enhancements, while the computational burden remains relatively low.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing transcription start sites is key to gene identification. Several approaches have been employed in related problems such as detecting translation initiation sites or promoters, many of the most recent ones based on machine learning. Deep learning methods have been proven to be exceptionally effective for this task, but their use in transcription start site identification has not yet been explored in depth. Also, the very few existing works do not compare their methods to support vector machines (SVMs), the most established technique in this area of study, nor provide the curated dataset used in the study. The reduced amount of published papers in this specific problem could be explained by this lack of datasets. Given that both support vector machines and deep neural networks have been applied in related problems with remarkable results, we compared their performance in transcription start site predictions, concluding that SVMs are computationally much slower, and deep learning methods, specially long short-term memory neural networks (LSTMs), are best suited to work with sequences than SVMs. For such a purpose, we used the reference human genome GRCh38. Additionally, we studied two different aspects related to data processing: the proper way to generate training examples and the imbalanced nature of the data. Furthermore, the generalization performance of the models studied was also tested using the mouse genome, where the LSTM neural network stood out from the rest of the algorithms. To sum up, this article provides an analysis of the best architecture choices in transcription start site identification, as well as a method to generate transcription start site datasets including negative instances on any species available in Ensembl. We found that deep learning methods are better suited than SVMs to solve this problem, being more efficient and better adapted to long sequences and large amounts of data. We also create a transcription start site (TSS) dataset large enough to be used in deep learning experiments.",

Android operating systems are particularly targeted due to their large market share. Previous studies have primarily relied on signature-based detection methods, which require sufficient data samples and labelled signatures. However, modern ransomware utilizes obfuscation techniques that make it challenging to analyse using static methods. This project proposes a hybrid analysis approach for Android ransomware, employing the SVM algorithm for detection. The novelty lies in the limited exploration of SVM algorithms for ransomware analysis. The dataset used in the study was obtained from CICA and Mal 2017. Static features, including permissions, intents, encoding methods, and API calls were used, along with dynamic features such as network activities and system calls. The SVM model achieved good performance, with 81% accuracy and 90% precision using static features, and 100% accuracy with dynamic features",

        "abstract": "Kidneys are one of the organs of the body that have a very important function in life. The main function of the kidneys is to excrete metabolic waste products. Chronic kidney disease is a result of the gradual loss of kidney function. Chronic kidney disease occurs when the kidneys are unable to maintain an internal environment consistent with life and the restoration of useless functions. Data mining is one of the fastest growing technologies in biomedical science and research. In the field of medicine, data mining can improve hospital information management and telemedicine development. In the first stage of data mining process, data processing is done with pre-processing by handling missing values ​​and data transformation. Then, the feature selection stage is carried out using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find the best attributes. Next, it is done by classifying the dataset. The algorithm used for classification is the C4.5 Algorithm and the Support Vector Machine. Both classifications are known as algorithms that have a fairly good level of accuracy. This study uses the chronic kidney disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of accuracy of the comparison between the C4.5 Algorithm and the Support Vector Machine after applying the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This research increases the accuracy by 100% for the C4.5 Algorithm and 98.75% for the Support Vector Machine by using 24 attributes and 1 class attribute.",

        "abstract": "A diverse group of so-called multi-vector techniques has recently appeared to enhance the control performance of multiphase drives when a direct control strategy is implemented. With different numbers of switching states and approaches for estimating the application times, each multi-vector solution has its own nature and merits. Previous studies have individually tested each version of the proposed finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategies using a single experimental setup with specific parameters and, in some cases, using a limited range of operating conditions and focusing exclusively on some control aspects. Although such works provide partial contributions, the control performance is highly affected by the test and rig conditions, being dependent on the machine parameters, the switching frequency and the range of operation. Consequently, it becomes difficult to extract some universal conclusions that guide the control designer on the best alternative for each application. Aiming to enrich the knowledge in this field and provide a broader picture, this work performs a global analysis with different multi-vector techniques, various machine parameters, multiple operating points and a complete set of indices. Experimental results confirm that the selection of the most adequate control strategy is not a trivial task because the degree to which multi-vector techniques are affected by the test conditions is variable and complex. Some tables with a qualitative analysis, based on the extensive empirical tests, contribute with a more complete insight and guide eventual control designers on the decision about the optimal regulation approach to be chosen.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe detection of microplastics in water requires a series of processes (sample collection, purification, and preparation) until a sample can be analyzed in the laboratory. To shorten this process chain, we are investigating whether electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) enhanced by a classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) can be applied to the problem of microplastics detection. Results with suspensions of polypropylene (PP) and polyolefin (PO) in deionized water proved promising: The relative permittivities extracted from the measured impedances agree with literature data. The subsequent classification of measured impedances by SVM shows that the three classes “no plastic” (below the detection limit of 1 g plastic per filling), “PP” and “PO” can be distinguished securely independent of the background medium water. Mixtures of PO and PP were not examined, i.e. either PO or PP was filled into the measuring cell. An SVM regression performed after the SVM classification yields the microplastic concentration of the respective sample. Further tests with varying salinity and content of organic or biological material in the water confirmed the good results. We conclude that EIS in combination with machine learning (MLEIS) seems to be a promising approach for in situ detection of microplastics and certainly warrants further research activities.",
