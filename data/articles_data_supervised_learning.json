        "abstract": "This chapter provides a brief overview of supervised learning methods as the literature on this topic is vast and rapidly evolving. It focuses on the basic elements of these techniques that seem particularly useful for asset pricing and looks at the material on some of those methods in more detail by reviewing asset pricing applications. Supervised learning methods can be grouped into two categories: classification and regression methods. The chapter explains that classification methods are used in settings where the dependent variable y is categorial, while regression methods deal with continuous dependent variables. In asset pricing applications, regression problems are more common, although classification methods can also be useful, for example for prediction of binary events like a corporate default.",

        "abstract": "This chapter looks at many prediction problems in asset pricing that are of high-dimensional nature in a large number of observable variables that could have useful predictive information. For example, in stock return prediction a huge number of variables could potentially be relevant as predictors. It covers firm characteristics from accounting data, signals extracted from textual information in corporate disclosures, variables summarizing the history of price and trading volume, information in media reports, and many other variables that could potentially contain predictive information. The chapter describes the existing literature in asset pricing that has dealt with this high-dimensionality by imposing ad hoc sparsity. Rather than considering large numbers of predictors simultaneously, researchers often consider small sets of predictors in isolation.",

In all industries, teamwork is being depended on as a preferred performance arrangement to fulfil visions, execute, and achieve goals. It is also a critical component of continuous improvement systems since it allows information exchange, issue resolution, and the growth of employee accountability. The Supervised Learning method was used to model team performance in this study on an intelligent coaching agent. We employed the Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design Methodology. Some web application languages were utilised to effectively execute this study, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), MySQL, Cascaded Style Sheet (CSS), Java Script, Dream weaver, and others",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms rely heavily on large sets of annotated data. This is especially true for deep learning (DL) neural networks, which need huge annotated data sets for good performance. However, large volumes of annotated data are not always readily available. In addition, some of the best performing ML and DL algorithms lack explainability – it is often difficult even for domain experts to interpret the results. This is an important consideration especially in safety-critical applications, such as AI-assisted medical endeavors, in which a DL’s failure mode is not well understood. This lack of explainability also increases the risk of malicious attacks by adversarial actors because these actions can become obscured in the decision-making process that lacks transparency. This paper describes an intensional learning approach which uses boosting to enhance prediction performance while minimizing reliance on availability of annotated data. The intensional information is derived from an unsupervised learning preprocessing step involving clustering. Preliminary evaluation on the MNIST data set has shown encouraging results. Specifically, using the proposed approach, it is now possible to achieve similar accuracy result as extensional learning alone while using only a small fraction of the original training data set.",

        "abstract": "Optimum drilling penetration rate, known as the rate of penetration (ROP) has played  a big role in drilling operations. Planning the well   ROP   always becomes a challenge for drilling engineers to calculate the drilling time needed for the section. Optimum ROP is achieved when the time to drill the section is as planned.\r\nMany empirical approaches were develop to model the ROP based on the drilling parameters, and might not always match  the actual ROP. In some cases, the actual ROP was slower than planned, which may increase the drilling cost, which needs to be avoided.\r\nHence, some approaches using artificial intelligent (AI), and supervised machine learning  have been develop to overcome it. Supervised machine learning is used to develop a ROP model and ROP prediction for one of  the development fields,  based only on two wells drilling parameters data. The model was train using Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. Drilling parameter test data then is used to validate the model. The model of Random Forest  shows a good or promising result with R2 of 0.90,   Gradient Boosting shows R2 of 0.86, and Support Vector Machine with R2 0.72. Based on the models generated, the Random Forest has shown good trend which could be used for modeling ROP in the future development wells.",

Recently, the development of deep learning, combined with rising amounts of data, has provided powerful tools to build predictive models.

In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework for GNNs tailored specifically for molecular property prediction. Our framework uses multiple pretext tasks focusing on different scales of molecules (atoms, fragments and entire molecules). We evaluate our method on a representative set of GNN architectures and datasets and also consider the impact of the choice of input features. Our results show that our framework can successfully improve performance compared to training from scratch, especially in low data regimes.

        "abstract": "We propose an acoustic anomaly detection algorithm based on the framework of contrastive learning. Contrastive learning is a recently proposed self-supervised approach that has shown promising results in image classification and speech recognition. However, its application in anomaly detection is underexplored. Earlier studies have demonstrated that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image anomaly detection, but its capability in anomalous sound detection is yet to be investigated. For the first time, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework that is suitable for acoustic anomaly detection. Since most existing contrastive learning approaches are targeted toward images, the effect of other data transformations on the performance of the algorithm is unknown. Our framework learns a representation from unlabeled data by applying audio-specific data augmentations.  We show that in the resulting latent space, normal and abnormal points are distinguishable. Experiments conducted on the MIMII dataset confirm that our approach can outperform competing methods in detecting anomalies.",

We analyze in depth the behavior of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised method, FixMatch, which relies on a weakly-augmented version of an image to obtain supervision signal for a more strongly-augmented version. We show that it frequently fails in barely-supervised scenarios, due to a lack of training signal when no pseudo-label can be predicted with high confidence. We propose a method to leverage self-supervised methods that provides training signal in the absence of confident pseudo-labels. We then propose two methods to refine the pseudo-label selection process which lead to further improvements.The first one relies on a per-sample history of the model predictions, akin to a voting scheme. The second iteratively up-dates class-dependent confidence thresholds to better explore classes that are under-represented in the pseudo-labels. Our experiments show that our approach performs significantly better on STL-10 in the barely-supervised regime,e.g. with 4 or 8 labeled images per class.",

The key idea in our work here is to achieve increased forecast capabilities by judiciously combining machine-learning algorithms and data assimilation. We combine the physics-agnostic data-driven approach of random feature maps as a forecast model within an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation procedure. The machine-learning model is learned sequentially by incorporating incoming noisy observations. We show that the obtained forecast model has remarkably good forecast skill while being computationally cheap once trained. Going beyond the task of forecasting, we show that our method can be used to generate reliable ensembles for probabilistic forecasting as well as to learn effective model closure in multi-scale systems.&lt;/p&gt;",

It is critical to understand the factors that influence project success. The goal of this study is to empirically discover the factors that lead to a successful project. This study used data from 469 projects to use three distinct supervised machine learning methods for classification: a) The Support Vector Machine (SVM), 2) The Probit regression, and 3) the Logistic regression. Five factors have been chosen.: Support from the top management, Technical skills, Client’s acceptance, Communication, and Monitoring. The findings of the SVM study revealed that SVM could accurately predict successful and unsuccessful projects. The findings of Logistic and Probit regression revealed that project success is more likely if project managers get appropriate top-level support and if the project team has sufficient technical capabilities. This study also discovered that good communication and control improve the odds of a project's success. However, according to the results of this research, client acceptability is a minor success factor for a project.",

        "abstract": "<div>In this study, we have proposed SCL-SSC(Supervised Contrastive Learning for Sleep Stage Classification), a deep learning-based framework for sleep stage classification which performs the task in two stages, 1) feature representation learning, and 2) classification. The feature learner is trained separately to represent the raw EEG signals in the feature space such that the distance between the embedding of EEG signals of the same sleep stage has less than the distance between the embedding of EEG signals of different sleep stages in the euclidean space. On top of feature learners, we have trained the classifier to perform the classification task. The distribution of sleep stages is not uniform in the PSG data, wake(W) and N2 sleep stages appear more frequently than the other sleep stages, which leads to an imbalance dataset problem. This paper addresses this issue by using weighted softmax cross-entropy loss function and also dataset oversampling technique utilized to produce synthetic data points for minority sleep stages for approximately balancing the number of sleep stages in the training dataset. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated on the publicly available Physionet datasets EDF-Sleep 2013 and 2018 versions. We have trained and evaluated our model on two EEG channels (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) on these datasets separately. The evaluation result shows that the performance of SCL-SSC is the best annotation performance compared to the existing state-of art deep learning algorithms to our best of knowledge, with an overall accuracy of 94.1071% with a macro F1 score of 92.6416 and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient(κ) 0.9197. Our ablation studies on SCL-SSC shows that both triplet loss based pre-training of feature learner and oversampling of minority classes are contributing to better performance of the model(SCL-SSC).</div>",

This necessitates novel approaches to ammonoid taxonomy. This study aimed to taxonomize ammonoids by their conch geometry using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Ammonoid measurement data (conch diameter, whorl height, whorl width, and umbilical width) were taken from the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). 11 species with ≥50 specimens each were identified providing N=781 total unique specimens. Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers were applied to the PBDB data with a 5x5 nested cross-validation approach to obtain unbiased generalization performance estimates across a grid search of algorithm parameters. All supervised classifiers achieved ≥70% accuracy in identifying ammonoid species, with Naive Bayes demonstrating the least over-fitting. The unsupervised clustering algorithms K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS, Mean Shift, and Affinity Propagation achieved Normalized Mutual Information scores of ≥0.6, with the centroid-based methods having most success. This presents a reasonably-accurate proof-of-concept approach to ammonoid classification which may assist identification in cases where more traditional methods are not feasible.",

        "abstract": "We propose an acoustic anomaly detection algorithm based on the framework of contrastive learning. Contrastive learning is a recently proposed self-supervised approach that has shown promising results in image classification and speech recognition. However, its application in anomaly detection is underexplored. Earlier studies have demonstrated that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image anomaly detection, but its capability in anomalous sound detection is yet to be investigated. For the first time, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework that is suitable for acoustic anomaly detection. Since most existing contrastive learning approaches are targeted toward images, the effect of other data transformations on the performance of the algorithm is unknown. Our framework learns a representation from unlabeled data by applying audio-specific data augmentations.  We show that in the resulting latent space, normal and abnormal points are distinguishable. Experiments conducted on the MIMII dataset confirm that our approach can outperform competing methods in detecting anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Directional discontinuities (DDs) are defined as abrupt changes of the\nmagnetic field orientation. We use observations from ESA’s Cluster\nmission to compile a database of events: 4216 events are identified in\nJanuary-April 2007, and 5194 in January-April 2008. Localized time-scale\nimages depicting angular changes are created for each event, and a\npreliminary classification algorithm is designed to distinguish between:\nsimple - isolated events, and complex - multiple overlapping events. In\n2007, 1806 events are pre-classified as simple, and 2410 as complex; in\n2008, 1997 events are simple, and 3197 are complex. A supervised machine\nlearning approach is used to recognize and predict these events. Two\nmodels are trained: one for 2007, which is used to predict the results\nin 2008, and vice-versa for 2008. To validate our results, we\ninvestigate the discontinuity occurrence rate as a function of\nspacecraft location. When the spacecraft is in the solar wind, we find\nan occurrence rate of ~2 DDs per hour and a 50/50 %\nratio of simple/complex events. When the spacecraft is in the Earth’s\nmagnetosheath, we find that the total occurrence rate remains around 2\nDDs/h, but the ratio of simple/complex events changes to\n~25/75 %. This implies that about half of the simple\nevents observed in the solar wind are classified as complex when\nobserved in the magnetosheath. This demonstrates that our classification\nscheme can provide meaningful insights, and thus be relevant for future\nstudies on interplanetary discontinuities.",

CERT creates augmentations of original sentences using back-translation. Then it finetunes a pretrained language encoder (e.g., BERT) by predicting whether two augmented sentences originate from the same sentence. CERT is simple to use and can be flexibly plugged into any pretraining-finetuning NLP pipeline. We evaluate CERT on three language understanding tasks: CoLA, RTE, and QNLI.

        "abstract": "We propose an acoustic anomaly detection algorithm based on the framework of contrastive learning. Contrastive learning is a recently proposed self-supervised approach that has shown promising results in image classification and speech recognition. However, its application in anomaly detection is underexplored. Earlier studies have demonstrated that it can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image anomaly detection, but its capability in anomalous sound detection is yet to be investigated. For the first time, we propose a contrastive learning-based framework that is suitable for acoustic anomaly detection. Since most existing contrastive learning approaches are targeted toward images, the effect of other data transformations on the performance of the algorithm is unknown. Our framework learns a representation from unlabeled data by applying audio-specific data augmentations.  We show that in the resulting latent space, normal and abnormal points are distinguishable. Experiments conducted on the MIMII dataset confirm that our approach can outperform competing methods in detecting anomalies.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic interactions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere give rise to dramatic auroral forms that have been instrumental in the ground-based study of magnetospheric dynamics. The general mechanism of aurora types and their large-scale patterns are well-known, but the morphology of small- to meso-scale auroral forms observed in all-sky imagers and their relation to magnetospheric dynamics&#160; and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the upper atmosphere remain in question. Machine learning has the potential to provide answers to these questions, but most existing auroral image data lack the ground-truth labels required for supervised learning and conventional statistical analyses. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised semi-supervised algorithm to automatically label the THEMIS all-sky image database. Specifically, we adapt the self-supervised Simple framework for Contrastive Learning of Representations (SimCLR) algorithm to learn latent representations of THEMIS all-sky images. These representations are finetuned using a small set of manually labeled data from the Oslo Aurora THEMIS (OATH) dataset, after which semi-supervised classification is used to train a classifier, beginning by training on the manually labeled OATH dataset and gradually incorporating the classifier&#8217;s most confident predictions on unlabeled data into the training dataset as ground-truth. We demonstrate that (a) classifiers fit to the learned representations of the manually labeled images achieve state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art performance, improving the classification accuracy by almost 10% over the current benchmark on labeled data; and (b) our model&#8217;s learned representations naturally cluster into more clusters than manually assigned categories, suggesting that existing categorizations are coarse and may obscure important connections between auroral types and their drivers. Finally, we introduce AuroraClick, a citizen science project with the goal of manually annotating a large representative sample of THEMIS all-sky images for the validation of our current models and the training of future models.&#160;&#160;",

        "abstract": "<div>In this study, we have proposed SCL-SSC(Supervised Contrastive Learning for Sleep Stage Classification), a deep learning-based framework for sleep stage classification which performs the task in two stages, 1) feature representation learning, and 2) classification. The feature learner is trained separately to represent the raw EEG signals in the feature space such that the distance between the embedding of EEG signals of the same sleep stage has less than the distance between the embedding of EEG signals of different sleep stages in the euclidean space. On top of feature learners, we have trained the classifier to perform the classification task. The distribution of sleep stages is not uniform in the PSG data, wake(W) and N2 sleep stages appear more frequently than the other sleep stages, which leads to an imbalance dataset problem. This paper addresses this issue by using weighted softmax cross-entropy loss function and also dataset oversampling technique utilized to produce synthetic data points for minority sleep stages for approximately balancing the number of sleep stages in the training dataset. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated on the publicly available Physionet datasets EDF-Sleep 2013 and 2018 versions. We have trained and evaluated our model on two EEG channels (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) on these datasets separately. The evaluation result shows that the performance of SCL-SSC is the best annotation performance compared to the existing state-of art deep learning algorithms to our best of knowledge, with an overall accuracy of 94.1071% with a macro F1 score of 92.6416 and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient(κ) 0.9197. Our ablation studies on SCL-SSC shows that both triplet loss based pre-training of feature learner and oversampling of minority classes are contributing to better performance of the model(SCL-SSC).</div>",

The auxiliary predictive tasks in existing pretraining approaches are mostly defined on tokens, thus may not be able to capture sentence-level semantics very well. To address this issue,  we propose CERT: Contrastive self-supervised Encoder Representations from Transformers, which pretrains language representation models using contrastive self-supervised learning at the sentence level. CERT creates augmentations of original sentences using back-translation. Then it finetunes a pretrained language encoder (e.g., BERT) by predicting whether two augmented sentences originate from the same sentence. CERT is simple to use and can be flexibly plugged into any pretraining-finetuning NLP pipeline. We evaluate CERT on three language understanding tasks: CoLA, RTE, and QNLI. CERT outperforms BERT significantly.<br>",

From the wireless network, the data from the kitchen, laundry and living room were ranked the highest in importance for the energy prediction. The prediction models with only the weather data, selected the atmospheric pressure (which is correlated to wind speed) as the most relevant weather data variable in the prediction.

Salah satunya menyediakan sistem informasi layanan bimbingan akademik untuk mendukung keputusan dan memudahkan penyediaan data bagi program studi. Pada saat ini layanan bimbingan akademik terhadap mahasiswa persemester pada prodi  yang ada di Fakultas Sains dan Teknologi UIN Sumatera Utara Medan, dilakukan secara manual yaitu menggunakan buku bimbingan akademik sebagai bukti kegiatan. Buku bimbingan memberikan informasi profil mahasiswa, ipk, total sks, masa penyelesaian akademik. Dimana variabel tersebut dapat digunakan untuk memprediksi kelulusan mahasiswa. Data yang digunakan total lulus pada program studi Sistem Informasi dan ilmu komputer sebanyak 301 data. Algoritma K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)  untuk menghitung data latih dan uji, dimana perbandingan data yang akan digunakan 80%:20% yaitu 211 data latih dan 90 data uji, dan hasil prediksi lulusan mahasiswa dengan euclidian K= 3.",

The presented\nframework ensures several desired features such as a graph-based\nregularization, a flexible projection model, a graph-based feature\naggregation, and a deep learning architecture. The model can be learned\nlayer by layer. In each layer, the nonlinear data representation and the\nunknown linear model are jointly estimated with a closed form solution.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on semi-supervised classification tasks\nusing six public image datasets.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Optimal treatment for cancer patients relies on accurate pathological diagnosis. The world health organization has defined almost 100 known central nervous system (CNS) tumors, making the histopathological diagnostic process particularly challenging. To help reduce variability, validation costs, and standardize the histopathological diagnostic process, supervised machine learning techniques using epigenetic data have been developed. These methods require large labeled training data sets to obtain clinically acceptable classification accuracy. However, labeling pathology data for machine learning models is time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for rare tumor types. On the other hand, there is now abundance of unlabeled epigenetic data across multiple databases. To maximize the utility of both labeled and unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach has been proposed and shown to be effective in genomic field. However, it has not yet been explored with epigenetic data nor demonstrated beneficial to CNS tumor classification.Results: This paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning on methylation data to improve accuracy of supervised learning models in classifying CNS tumors. We comprehensively evaluated 11 SSL methods and developed a novel combination approach including a self-training with editing using support vector machine (SETRED-SVM) as the base learner model with an L2-penalized, multinomial logistic regression model to obtain high confidence labels from a small labeled instances. Results across 8 differently trained random forest and neural net models show that SETRED-SVM followed with multinomial logistic regression approach is able to produce high confidence training data set, leading to a statiscally significant increase in prediction accuracy of 82 CNS tumors.Conclusions: The proposed combination of semi-supervised technique and multinomial logistic regression holds the potential to leverage the abundant publically available unlabeled methylation data effectively. Such an approach is highly beneficial in providing additional training examples, especially for scarce tumor types, to boost the prediction accuracy of supervised models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn Nondestructive testing there is a variety of applications in Material Science, where the specimen is imaged by an Electron Microscope and then by image inversion, informationis extracted for the material interior. This type of information might contain noise either by the imaging procedure or by the numerical part of the inversion. We present a method that can improve the interior density results of an inversed material from a series of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. For this method, the material density can contain some discontinuity, such as regions where it is dense and regions where there are voids.The proposed method directly stands on the Bayesian learning framework, adopting Gaussian Stochastic Processes (GSPs). Two test sample cases that contain some discontinuities in the density are tested. We also provide a comparison between two different GSP modelling approaches; one is a typical GSP and the other accounts for discontinuity, by introducing hyperparameters. The GSP method gives reconstructed data in reasonable agreement with the known original density distribution, giving confidence that the method can be applied to experimentally obtained SEM images.",

        "abstract": "Mineralogical analysis is critical for understanding the origins and properties of various rock types. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies, particularly supervised deep learning, have transformed qualitative and quantitative mineral analysis. However, current deep-learning approaches require high-quality annotated datasets to acquire and identify different mineralogical characteristics and properties. This is exacerbated by the time-consuming and error-prone labeling processes for the datasets. With self-supervised architectures matching supervised approaches in many computer vision tasks, it is timely to investigate the potential of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models in the geosciences. As a result, we use a self-supervised semantic segmentation model to identify and characterize minerals in thin sections, with the model attempting to obtain categories of interest from images without the need for human intervention in annotating the minerals. In this study, we adopted a Self-Supervised Transformer architecture and proposed SelfMin to automatically segment out pyrite minerals from other background gangue minerals in the thin section. Our proposed method achieved 80% in the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric, indicating the model's ability to accurately segment minerals that were not labeled during the annotation process. This work describes the first use of self-supervised deep learning in mineralogical analysis. Further application of this proposed method would allow a robust and efficient advanced qualitative and quantitative mineralogical analysis. It also demonstrates how this technique can be implemented to avoid the need for a large volume of high-quality labeled datasets in other image-based deep learning geosciences analyses.",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on insider-threat detection within healthcare infrastructures. There are inherent dangers to digitising patient records and considering the sensitive nature of the data, EHR is equally at risk of both external threats and insider attacks, but security applications are predominantly facing the outer boundary of the network. In this work, the focus is on insider data misuse detection. The approach involves the use of supervised classification (decision tree, random forest and support vector machine) based off pre-labelled real world data collated from a UK-based hospital for the detection of EHR data misuse. The results demonstrate that by employing a machine learning approach to analyse EHR data access, anomaly detection can be achieved with a 0.9896 accuracy from a test set and 0.9908 from the validation set using a support vector machine classifier. The emphasis of this research is on the detection of EHR data misuse, through the detection of anomalous behavioural patterns. Based on the results, the recommendation is to adopt an SVM for data misuse/insider threat detection",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised pretraining based on contrastive learning has made significant progress recently and showed comparable or even superior transfer learning performance to traditional supervised pretraining on various tasks. In this work, we first empirically investigate when and why unsupervised pretraining surpasses supervised counterparts for image classification tasks with a series of control experiments. Besides the commonly used accuracy, we further analyze the results qualitatively with the class activation maps and assess the learned representations quantitatively with the representation entropy and uniformity. Our core finding is that it is the amount of information effectively perceived by the learning model that is crucial to transfer learning, instead of absolute size of the dataset. Based on this finding, we propose Classification Activation Map guided contrastive (CAMtrast) learning which better utilizes the label supervsion to strengthen supervised pretraining, by making the networks perceive more information from the training images. CAMtrast is evaluated with three fundamental visual learning tasks: image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, on various public datasets. Experimental results show that our CAMtrast effectively improves the performance of supervised pretraining, and that its performance is superior to both unsupervised counterparts and a recent related work which similarly attempted improving supervised pretraining.",

        "abstract": "<p>In recent literature, ECG-based stress assessment has become popular due to its proven correlation to stress and increased accessibility of ECG data through commodity hardware. However, most ECG-based stress assessment models use supervised learning, relying on manually-annotated data. Limited research is done in the area of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that leverage unlabelled data and none that utilize contrastive SSL. However, with the dominance of contrastive SSL in domains such as computer vision, it is essential to see if the same excellence in performance can be obtained on an ECG-based stress assessment dataset. In this paper, we propose a contrastive SSL model for stress assessment using ECG signals based on the SimCLR framework. We test our model on two ECG-based stress assessment datasets. We show that our proposed solution results in a 9% improvement in accuracy on the WESAD dataset and 3.7% on the RML dataset when compared with SOTA ECG-based SSL models for stress assessment. The development of more accurate stress assessment models, particularly those that employ non-invasive data such as ECG for assessment, leads to developments in wearable technology and the creation of better health monitoring applications in areas such as stress management and relaxation therapy.</p>",

        "abstract": "Decision tree algorithms have been among the most popular algorithms for interpretable (transparent) machine learning since the early 1980s. On the other hand, deep learning methods have boosted the capacity of machine learning algorithms and are now being used for non-trivial applications in various applied domains. But training a fully-connected deep feed-forward network by gradient-descent backpropagation is slow and requires arbitrary choices regarding the number of hidden units and layers. In this paper, we propose near-optimal neural regression trees, intending to make it much faster than deep feed-forward networks and for which it is not essential to specify the number of hidden units in the hidden layers of the neural network in advance. The key idea is to construct a decision tree and then simulate the decision tree with a neural network. This work aims to build a mathematical formulation of neural trees and gain the complementary benefits of both sparse optimal decision trees and neural trees. We propose near-optimal sparse neural trees (NSNT) that is shown to be asymptotically consistent and robust in nature. Additionally, the proposed NSNT model obtain a fast rate of convergence which is near-optimal up to some logarithmic factor. We comprehensively benchmark the proposed method on a sample of 80 datasets (40 classification datasets and 40 regression datasets) from the UCI machine learning repository. We establish that the proposed method is likely to outperform the current state-of-the-art methods (random forest, XGBoost, optimal classification tree, and near-optimal nonlinear trees) for the majority of the datasets.",

        "abstract": "<p>In recent literature, ECG-based stress assessment has become popular due to its proven correlation to stress and increased accessibility of ECG data through commodity hardware. However, most ECG-based stress assessment models use supervised learning, relying on manually-annotated data. Limited research is done in the area of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that leverage unlabelled data and none that utilize contrastive SSL. However, with the dominance of contrastive SSL in domains such as computer vision, it is essential to see if the same excellence in performance can be obtained on an ECG-based stress assessment dataset. In this paper, we propose a contrastive SSL model for stress assessment using ECG signals based on the SimCLR framework. We test our model on two ECG-based stress assessment datasets. We show that our proposed solution results in a 9% improvement in accuracy on the WESAD dataset and 3.7% on the RML dataset when compared with SOTA ECG-based SSL models for stress assessment. The development of more accurate stress assessment models, particularly those that employ non-invasive data such as ECG for assessment, leads to developments in wearable technology and the creation of better health monitoring applications in areas such as stress management and relaxation therapy.</p>",

We developed a new quantum machine learning (QML) assisted diagnostic method that can provide an accurate diagnosis to aid decision processes of medical providers. One of the key elements in our method was to implement the quantum variational method to efficiently classify data, taking crucial multiple correlations among the features into account. We established and fine-tuned this quantum classifier by using a group of data drawn from publicly available COVID-19 cases. We have shown that QML is capable of processing patient information efficiently and accurately for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMotivation: Genome-wide association studies have systematically identified thousands of single nucleotide polymor-phisms (SNPs) associated with complex genetic diseases. However, the majority of those SNPs were found in non-coding genomic regions, preventing the understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. Predicting molecular processes based on the DNA sequence represents a promising approach to understand the role of those non-coding SNPs. Over the past years, deep learning was successfully applied to regulatory sequence prediction using supervised learning. Supervised learning required DNA sequences associated with functional data for training, whose amount is strongly limited by the finite size of the human genome. Conversely, the amount of mammalian DNA sequences is exponentially increasing due to ongoing large sequencing projects, but without functional data in most cases. \nResults: To alleviate the limitations of supervised learning, we propose a paradigm shift with semi-supervised learning, which does not only exploit labeled sequences (e.g. human genome with ChIP-seq experiment), but also unlabeled sequences available in much larger amounts (e.g. from other species without ChIP-seq experiment, such as chimpanzee). Our approach is flexible and can be plugged into any neural architecture including shallow and deep networks, and shows strong predictive performance improvements compared to supervised learning in most cases (up to 70%). \nAvailability and implementation: https://forgemia.inra.fr/raphael.mourad/deepgnn",

        "abstract": "This article focuses on insider-threat detection within healthcare infrastructures. There are inherent dangers to digitising patient records and considering the sensitive nature of the data, EHR is equally at risk of both external threats and insider attacks, but security applications are predominantly facing the outer boundary of the network. In this work, the focus is on insider data misuse detection. The approach involves the use of supervised classification (decision tree, random forest and support vector machine) based off pre-labelled real world data collated from a UK-based hospital for the detection of EHR data misuse. The results demonstrate that by employing a machine learning approach to analyse EHR data access, anomaly detection can be achieved with a 0.9896 accuracy from a test set and 0.9908 from the validation set using a support vector machine classifier. The emphasis of this research is on the detection of EHR data misuse, through the detection of anomalous behavioural patterns. Based on the results, the recommendation is to adopt an SVM for data misuse/insider threat detection",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe adoption of Deep Neural Networks has surged due to their ability to automatically extract features and employ diverse approaches in data analysis. This research proposes a novel feature extraction method that doesn't rely on labeled training data, particularly considering the utilization of hard negatives. Given the remarkable success of DNN-based models in analyzing various medical images, including disease diagnosis and detection, this paper delves into diagnosing the lesion area against the normal area, particularly in the context of the non-invasive treatment of HIFU. Monitoring and analyzing inputs related to the lesion area are crucial to prevent damage to normal tissue during the heating process. However, several challenges exist in ultrasound medical imaging, including small sample sizes, data lacking labels, and the time-intensive nature of deep supervised training. These challenges have motivated the introduction of a new self-supervised deep learning method. While supervised learning excels in accuracy, unlabeled data holds valuable information discarded in supervised approaches. Conversely, ultrasonic data's nature lies in the RF signal, offering a detailed acoustic structure of tissue. Acknowledging the limitations and advantages of each method, an effective approach leveraging both signal and image simultaneously is presented. This integrated method enhances diagnostic capabilities and contributes to improve monitoring of HIFU procedures. The proposed methodology for classifying HIFU lesion areas attained high performance metrics: 95% accuracy, 94% precision, 96% recall, and a 95% F1-score. These outcomes underscore the efficacy of the proposed method in accurately classifying HIFU lesion areas.",

The comparison considered performance measures such as the area under the curve (AUC), F-score, precision, and confusion matrix. The paper evaluated the performance of eight supervised learning algorithms for email spam detection. The first stage collected the dataset of emails from the Kaggle repository. The second stage involves pre-processing, duplicate removal, and the dataset features scaling. After the pre-processing stage, the study employed a synthetic minority technique for balancing samples representing the spam and no spam emails in the dataset. In the final stage, the supervised learning algorithms are trained on the pre-processed dataset and then the test result is analyzed. The comparison shows the random forest (RF) model performing at higher accuracy than the other models. The RG model achieved 96.6% accuracy in email spam detection. Thus, the result demonstrates that different models tend to perform differently in email spam detection.",

        "abstract": "<div>The analysis of intercepted multi-function radar (MFR) signals has gained considerable attention in the field of cognitive electronic reconnaissance. With the rapid development of MFR, the switch between different work modes is becoming more flexible, increasing the agility of pulse parameters. Most of the existing approaches for recognizing MFR behaviors heavily depend on prior information, which can hardly be obtained in a non-cooperative way. This study develops a novel hierarchical contrastive self-supervise-based method for segmenting and clustering MFR pulse sequences. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a limited receptive field is trained in a contrastive way to distinguish between pulse descriptor words (PDW) in the original order and the samples created by random permutations to detect the boundary between each radar word and perform segmentation. Afterward, the K-means++ algorithm with cosine distances is established to cluster the segmented PDWs according to the output vectors of the CNN’s last layer for radar words extraction. This segmenting and clustering process continues to go in the extracted radar word sequence, radar phase sequence, and so on, finishing the automatic extraction of MFR behavior states in the MFR hierarchical model. Simulation results show that without using any labeled data, the proposed method can effectively mine distinguishable patterns in the sequentially arriving PDWs and recognize the MFR behavior states under corrupted, overlapped pulse parameters.</div>",

        "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is one of the most dangerous cyber-attack to Software Defined Networks (SDN). It works by sending a large volume of fake network traffic from multiple sources in order to consume the network resources. Among various DDoS attacks, TCP SYN flooding attack is one of the most popular DDoS attacks. In this attack, the attacker sends large amounts of half-open TCP connections on the targeted server in order to exhaust its resources and make it unavailable. SDN architecture separates the control plane and data plane. This separation makes it easier to the controller to program and manage the entire network from single device to make better decisions than when the control is distributed among all the switches. These features will be utilized in this thesis to implement our detection system. Researchers have proposed many solutions to better utilize SDN to detect DDoS attacks, however, it is still a very challenging problem for quick and precise detection of this kind of attacks. In this thesis, we introduce a novel DDoS detection system based on semi-supervised algorithm with Logistic Regression classifier. The algorithm is implemented as a software module on POX SDN controller. We have conducted various test scenarios, comparing it with the traditional approach in the literature. The approach presented in this thesis manages to have a better attack detection rate with a lower reaction time.",

        "abstract": "Reaching the performance of fully supervised learning with unlabeled data and only labeling one sample per class might be ideal for deep learning applications. We demonstrate for the first time the potential for building one-shot semi-supervised (BOSS) learning on CIFAR-10 and SVHN up to attain test accuracies that are comparable to fully supervised learning. Our method combines class prototype refining, class balancing, and self-training. A good prototype choice is essential and we propose a technique for obtaining iconic examples. In addition, we demonstrate that class balancing methods substantially improve accuracy results in semi-supervised learning to levels that allow self-training to reach the level of fully supervised learning performance. Our experiments demonstrate the value with computing and analyzing test accuracies for every class, rather than only a total test accuracy. We show that our BOSS methodology can obtain total test accuracies with CIFAR-10 images and only one labeled sample per class up to 95% (compared to 94.5% for fully supervised). Similarly, the SVHN images obtains test accuracies of 97.8%, compared to 98.27% for fully supervised. Rigorous empirical evaluations provide evidence that labeling large datasets is not necessary for training deep neural networks.

        "abstract": "<div>The analysis of intercepted multi-function radar (MFR) signals has gained considerable attention in the field of cognitive electronic reconnaissance. With the rapid development of MFR, the switch between different work modes is becoming more flexible, increasing the agility of pulse parameters. Most of the existing approaches for recognizing MFR behaviors heavily depend on prior information, which can hardly be obtained in a non-cooperative way. This study develops a novel hierarchical contrastive self-supervise-based method for segmenting and clustering MFR pulse sequences. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a limited receptive field is trained in a contrastive way to distinguish between pulse descriptor words (PDW) in the original order and the samples created by random permutations to detect the boundary between each radar word and perform segmentation. Afterward, the K-means++ algorithm with cosine distances is established to cluster the segmented PDWs according to the output vectors of the CNN’s last layer for radar words extraction. This segmenting and clustering process continues to go in the extracted radar word sequence, radar phase sequence, and so on, finishing the automatic extraction of MFR behavior states in the MFR hierarchical model. Simulation results show that without using any labeled data, the proposed method can effectively mine distinguishable patterns in the sequentially arriving PDWs and recognize the MFR behavior states under corrupted, overlapped pulse parameters.</div>",

        "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is one of the most dangerous cyber-attack to Software Defined Networks (SDN). It works by sending a large volume of fake network traffic from multiple sources in order to consume the network resources. Among various DDoS attacks, TCP SYN flooding attack is one of the most popular DDoS attacks. In this attack, the attacker sends large amounts of half-open TCP connections on the targeted server in order to exhaust its resources and make it unavailable. SDN architecture separates the control plane and data plane. This separation makes it easier to the controller to program and manage the entire network from single device to make better decisions than when the control is distributed among all the switches. These features will be utilized in this thesis to implement our detection system. Researchers have proposed many solutions to better utilize SDN to detect DDoS attacks, however, it is still a very challenging problem for quick and precise detection of this kind of attacks. In this thesis, we introduce a novel DDoS detection system based on semi-supervised algorithm with Logistic Regression classifier. The algorithm is implemented as a software module on POX SDN controller. We have conducted various test scenarios, comparing it with the traditional approach in the literature. The approach presented in this thesis manages to have a better attack detection rate with a lower reaction time.",

Due to simple and powerful concept of computer programs, genetic programming can solve many supervised machine learning problems, especially regression and classifications. The chapter starts with theory of supervised machine learning by describing the three main groups of modelling: regression, binary, and multiclass classification. Through those kinds of modelling, the most important performance parameters and skill scores are introduced. The chapter also describes procedures of the model evaluation and construction of confusion matrix for binary and multiclass classification. The second part describes in detail how to use genetic programming in order to build high performance GP models for regression and classifications. It also describes the procedure of generating computer programs for binary and multiclass calcification problems by introducing the concept of predefined root node. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Nowadays, when somebody wants to make some decisions about a product or a service everyone goes with the reviews as it has become an essential part of decision making. When a customer wants to order a product on an e commerce website firstly everyone checks the review section in detail and further proceeds for decision making about the product. If the reviews posted were satisfactory for the customer he may order the product thus reviews become a reputed parameter for the businesses and companies and also a great source of information for the customers. Every customer thinks that the reviews he/she is seeing is authentic and any manipulation in that from any individuals or any rival companies which may lead to fake data which will be labeled as fake reviews. This type of attempt if not noticed may let us think about the gen-unity of the data. So these reviews are the most important parameter for the businesses and companies. There exist some groups or persons who make use of these reviews to forge customers for their own interest or damage their competitors reputation. In order to solve this problem we uses Machine learning techniques(Supervised and semi-supervised) to detect whether the given review is fake or not with high accuracy. Along with this objective we also focus on developing models which need less data to train.Since we can’t always be able to get labeled data we use semi-supervised machine learning to make use of unlabeled data.It is understandable our model should be capable of giving results in reasonably less time. .In this paper we proposed many classification algorithm like Support Vector Machine algorithm (SVM) , Random Forest algorithm (RF) and deep neural network",

        "abstract": "Fine-tuning a deep convolutional neural network (DCN) as a place-class detector (PCD) is a direct method to realize domain-adaptive visual place recognition (VPR). Although the PCD model is effective, a PCD model requires considerable amount of class-specific training examples and class-set maintenance in long-term large-scale VPR scenarios. Therefore, we propose to employ a DCN as a landmark-class detector (LCD), which allows to distinguish exponentially large numbers of different places by combining multiple landmarks, and furthermore, allows to select a stable part of the scenes (such as buildings) as landmark classes to reduce the need for class-set maintenance. However, the following important questions remain. 1) How we should mine such training examples (landmark objects) even when we have no domain-specific object detector? 2) How we should fine-tune the architecture and parameters of the DCN to a new domain-specific landmark set? To answer these questions, we present a self-supervised landmark mining approach for collecting pseudo-labeled landmark examples, and then consider the network architecture search (NAS) on the LCD task, which has significantly larger search space than typical NAS applications such as PCD. Extensive verification experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework to previous LCD methods with hand-crafted architectures and/or non-adaptive parameters, and 90% reduction in NAS cost compared with the naive NAS implementation.",

My dissertation presents series of experiments about how the statistical properties of stimuli incidental to a supervised classification task influence later learning. After exposure to task-irrelevant but statistically varying features, do people “transfer in” such knowledge to new problems where that information is suddenly applicable, or do they learn nothing at all in the first place such that they have nothing to transfer out of the first learning situation. What information about irrelevant features bias people when they move to another task where those features become relevant?The literature is unclear about how irrelevant features are used in later tasks, and most studies use categories that are binary: either the feature is present or absent. Few studies present continuous features with many distributions, and no study has systematically compared different distributions between tasks, especially with a large number of participants recruited online.These findings will inform how we can structure environments and tasks to prepare people to learn without explicitly teaching them before the task. This could make learning well-designed curricula and tasks more efficient. Another outcome of this dissertation research will be a number of open-source projects making online psychology experiments easier to perform, analyze, and replicate.",

With the increasing prevalence of fake news in online media, it has become critical to identify and categorize such articles accurately. In this study, we apply NLP techniques to extract features from textual data, and use a supervised learning algorithm to train a classification model. We use a dataset of fake news articles to evaluate the performance of our model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our results demonstrate that our approach achieved high accuracy and robustness in the classification of fake news articles. Furthermore, we perform a feature importance analysis to identify the most significant features that contribute to the classification of fake news. The findings of this study have practical implications for identifying and combating fake news in online media, and also provide insights into the effectiveness of NLP and supervised learning for text classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Language as an abstraction for hierarchical agents is promising to solve compositional long-time horizon decision-making tasks. The learning of the agent poses significant challenges, as it typically requires plenty of trajectories annotated with languages. This paper addresses the challenge of learning such an agent under the scarcity of language annotations. One approach for leveraging unannotated data is to generate pseudo-labels for unannotated trajectories using sparse seed annotations. However, as the scenes of the environment and tasks assigned to the agent are diverse, the inference of language instructions is sometimes incorrect, causing the policy to learn to ground incorrect instructions to actions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised language-conditioned hierarchical skill policy (SLHSP) which utilizes unannotated data to learn reusable and general task-related skills to facilitate learning from sparse annotations. We demonstrate that the SLHSP that learned with less than 10% of annotated trajectories has a comparable performance to one that learned with 100% of annotated data. Our approach to the challenging ALFRED benchmark leads to a notable improvement in the success rate over a strong baseline also optimized for sparsely annotated data.",

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (SML) is a powerful method for predicting a small number of well-defined output groups (e.g., potential buyers of a certain product) by taking as input a large number of known well-defined measurements (e.g., past purchases, income, ethnicity, gender, credit record, age, favorite color, favorite chewing gum). SML is predicated upon the existence of a training dataset in which the correspondence between the input and output is known to be true. SML has had enormous success in the world of commerce, and this success has prompted a few scientists to employ it in the study of molecular and genome evolution. Here, we list the properties of SML that make it an unsuitable tool in evolutionary studies. In particular, we argue that SML cannot be used in an evolutionary exploratory context for the simple reason that training datasets that are known to be a priori true do not exist. As a case study, we use an SML study in which it was concluded that most human genomes evolve by positive selection through soft selective sweeps (Schrider and Kern 2017). We show that in the absence of legitimate training datasets, Schrider and Kern (2017) used (1) simulations that employ many manipulatable variables and (2) a system of cherry-picking data that would put to shame most modern evangelical exegeses of the Bible. These two factors, in addition to the lack of methodological detail and the lack of either negative controls or corrections for multiple comparisons, lead us to conclude that all evolutionary inferences derived from so-called SML algorithms (e.g., discoal) should be taken with a huge shovel of salt.",

        "abstract": "Pretraining has become a standard technique in computer vision and natural language processing, which usually helps to improve performance substantially. Previously, the most dominant pretraining method is transfer learning (TL), which uses labeled data to learn a good representation network. Recently, a new pretraining approach -- self-supervised learning (SSL) -- has demonstrated promising results on a wide range of applications. SSL does not require annotated labels. It is purely conducted on input data by solving auxiliary tasks defined on the input data examples. The current reported results show that in certain applications, SSL outperforms TL and the other way around in other applications. There has not been a clear understanding on what properties of data and tasks render one approach outperforms the other. Without an informed guideline, ML researchers have to try both methods to find out which one is better empirically. It is usually  time-consuming to do so. In this work, we aim to address this problem. We perform a comprehensive comparative study between SSL and TL regarding which one works better under different properties of data and tasks, including domain difference between source and target tasks, the amount of pretraining data, class imbalance in source data, and usage of target data for additional pretraining, etc. The insights distilled from our comparative studies can help ML researchers decide which method to use based on the properties of their applications.",

The prediction system assists the obstetricians in assessing the state of the fetus better than the category methods, as only about 30% of the patients in the pathological category suffer from acidosis, while the majority of acidotic babies were in the suspect category, which is considered lower risk. By predicting the direct indicator of acidosis, umbilical cord pH, this work demonstrates a methodology, which uses fetal heart rate and uterine activity, to identify acidosis. This paper introduces a forecasting model based on deep learning to predict heart rate and uterine contractions, integrated with the classification algorithm, resulting in a robust tool for predictive fetal monitoring. The hybrid algorithm resulted in a model capable of providing future conditions of the fetus, which obstetricians can use for diagnosis and planning interventions. The ensemble classification algorithm had a test accuracy of 85% (n = 24) in predicting fetal acidosis on the features extracted from the cardiotocography data. When integrated with the classification model, the results from the prediction model (long short-term memory network) can effectively identify fetal acidosis 2 or 4 min in the future.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, deep learning applications in biomedical research\nhave exploded, demonstrating their ability to often outperform previous\nmachine learning approaches in various tasks. However, training deep\nlearning models for biomedical applications requires large amounts of\ndata annotated by experts, whose collection is often time- and cost-\nprohibitive. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a prominent\nsolution for such problem, as it allows to learn powerful\nrepresentations from vast unlabeled data by producing supervisory\nsignals directly from the data. The high amount of recent works\nemploying the self-supervised learning paradigm for the analysis of\nbiomedical signals (biosignals) can make it difficult for researchers to\nhave a complete picture of the current research state. Therefore, this\npaper aims at outlining and clarifying the state-of-the-art in the\ndomain. The article: briefly summarizes the nature and acquisition\nmodality of the main biosignals; introduces the self-supervised learning\nmethod, focusing on the different pretraining strategies; provides a\nconcise overview of the works employing SSL for the analysis of\ndifferent types of biosignals; provides an overall analysis of critical\naspects to consider when employing SSL to biosignals, also highlighting\ncurrent open challenges. The analysis of the scientific literature\nhighlights the importance of SSL, confirming its potential to improve\nmodels’ performance and robustness, and to promote the integration of\ndeep learning into clinical tasks.",

However, it faces issues like how it can be applied to the medicine and biology for healthcare aspects. Recently, quick advances of programming and equipment innovation have made simple, the issue of keeping up beneficial images accumulations. Visual elements like shading, and shape and composition are actualized for image retrieval. Conventional strategies for image indexing have been demonstrated neither reasonable nor effective regarding space and time so it set off the advancement of the new approach. A new concept called Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is beneficial for the different sort of medical images having dissimilar imaging modalities, anatomic areas with diverse directions and biological schemes is projected. Classification of the medical image retrieval is the major concern for group of medical image. Hence, support vector machine (SVM) classifier can be favorable for grouping forecast of query and database images based on similarity matching.  It is very difficult to detect the features of the compared images effectively for all the different types of queries.  Hence, the proposed SVM-MIR aims to classify and retrieval of biomedical images using SVM classifier method. The SVM-MIR based classification considers numerous groups of medical images for analysis. The outcomes of the proposed SVM-MIR approach achieve better performance compared to the existing approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe significant impact in businesses is generally affected by manufacturing, planning, supply chain, marketing, warehousing, logistics, and resource management, usually managed by sales forecasting. Casual forecasting techniques and the correlations between factors are used to anticipate future sales behaviour without relying on historical data and trends. Despite the wide usage in research and application, there are severe drawbacks regarding the forecasting techniques related to classic time series. The sales related to supermarkets, along with association rules, regression techniques, time series algorithms, etc., are estimated by numerous available methods. This paper explains constructing a prediction model based on a supervised machine learning algorithm known as Ada Boost to estimate possible sales for 45 Walmart stores in various locations. It is a great opportunity for researchers to predict sales for Walmart, as it is the largest store existing in the world. The sales will be affected on a periodic basis during an event or holidays. This affect might also extend on a daily basis.",

        "abstract": "Although deep learning algorithms have achieved significant progress in a variety of domains, they require costly annotations on huge datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) using unlabeled data has emerged as an alternative, as it eliminates manual annotation. To do this, SSL constructs feature representations using pretext tasks that operate without manual annotation, which allows models trained in these tasks to extract useful latent representations that later improve downstream tasks such as object classification and detection. The early methods of SSL are based on auxiliary pretext tasks as a way to learn representations using pseudo-labels, or labels that were created automatically based on the dataset’s attributes. Furthermore, contrastive learning has also performed well in learning representations via SSL. To succeed, it pushes positive samples closer together, and negative ones further apart, in the latent space. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the top-performing SSL methods using auxiliary pretext and contrastive learning techniques. It details the motivation for this research, a general pipeline of SSL, the terminologies of the field, and provides an examination of pretext tasks and self-supervised methods. It also examines how self-supervised methods compare to supervised ones, and then discusses both further considerations and ongoing challenges faced by SSL.",

        "abstract": "\nUNSTRUCTURED\nScoliosis is an abnormal spine curvature with a frontal plane deviation of more than 10 degrees and axial rotation. The measuring of the Cobb angle is time-consuming. It contributes to observer disparities due to variations in identifying the end vertebra, posing a challenge for inexperienced clinicians in accurately assessing scoliosis. SSL tasks expand the dataset before pretraining, improving the model’s efficiency at learning unlabeled features of data. To explore the use of SSL to address this issue, we used a dataset which comprises 609 x-ray spinal images depicting various scoliosis cases, each annotated with three Cobb angles (MA, TA, and BA). We applied SSL in the form of an image rotation pretext task to train a MobileNetV2 model to understand aspects of the images without any training data. We then fine-tuned this model against the same network without any SSL pre-training. We found that the model pre-trained with SSL outperformed the model without SSL pre-training, whether or not the model was initialized using ImageNet weights. This work demonstrates the promise of SSL for Cobb angle prediction using x-ray images. We recommend that the medical imaging research community explore further SSL pre-training strategies for regression tasks such as Cobb angle prediction.\n",

        "abstract": "Pretraining has become a standard technique in computer vision and natural language processing, which usually helps to improve performance substantially. Previously, the most dominant pretraining method is transfer learning (TL), which uses labeled data to learn a good representation network. Recently, a new pretraining approach -- self-supervised learning (SSL) -- has demonstrated promising results on a wide range of applications. SSL does not require annotated labels. It is purely conducted on input data by solving auxiliary tasks defined on the input data examples. The current reported results show that in certain applications, SSL outperforms TL and the other way around in other applications. There has not been a clear understanding on what properties of data and tasks render one approach outperforms the other. Without an informed guideline, ML researchers have to try both methods to find out which one is better empirically. It is usually  time-consuming to do so. In this work, we aim to address this problem. We perform a comprehensive comparative study between SSL and TL regarding which one works better under different properties of data and tasks, including domain difference between source and target tasks, the amount of pretraining data, class imbalance in source data, and usage of target data for additional pretraining, etc. The insights distilled from our comparative studies can help ML researchers decide which method to use based on the properties of their applications.",

In contrast to the biased individual inputs to enhance the generality, this paper introduces adversarial dropout, which is a minimal set of dropouts that maximize the divergence between 1) the training supervision and 2) the outputs from the network with the dropouts. The identified adversarial dropouts are used to automatically reconfigure the neural network in the training process, and we demonstrated that the simultaneous training on the original and the reconfigured network improves the generalization performance of supervised and semi-supervised learning tasks on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. We analyzed the trained model to find the performance improvement reasons. We found that adversarial dropout increases the sparsity of neural networks more than the standard dropout. Finally, we also proved that adversarial dropout is a regularization term with a rank-valued hyper-parameter that is different from a continuous-valued parameter to specify the strength of the regularization.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The most critical aspect of application of digital soil mapping is its limited transferability. Modelling soil properties for regions where no or only sparse soil information is available is highly uncertain, when using the low-cost geo-spatial environmental covariates alone. To overcome this drawback, transfer learning has been introduced in different environmental sciences, including soil science. The general idea behind extrapolation of soil information with transfer learning in soil science is that the target area to transfer to is alike, e.g. in terms of soil-forming factors, and the same machine learning rules can be applied. Supervised machine learning, so far, has been used to transfer the soil information from the reference to the target areas with very similar environmental characteristics between both. Hence, it is unclear how machine learning can perform for other target regions with different environmental characteristics. Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data (reference area) with a large amount of unlabeled data (target area) during training. In this study, we explored if semi-supervised learning could improve the transferability of digital soil mapping relative to supervised learning methods. Soil data for two arid regions and associated environmental covariates were obtained. Semi-supervised learning and supervised learning models were trained based on the data in the reference area and then tested based on the data in the target area. The results of this study indicated the higher power of semi-supervised learning for transferring soil information from one area to another in comparison to the supervised learning method.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

This development easily expands the data size and its complexity for data analysis, where one of it is to label similar dispersion cuts and map them spatially. In this work, we demonstrate that the recent development in representational learning (self-supervised learning) model combined with k-means clustering can help automate that part of data analysis and save precious time, albeit with low performance. Finally, we introduce a few-shot learning (k-nearest neighbour or kNN) in representational space where we selectively choose one (k=1) image reference for each known label and subsequently label the rest of the data with respect to the nearest reference image. This last approach demonstrates the strength of the self-supervised learning to automate the image analysis in ARPES in particular and can be generalized into any science data analysis that heavily involves image data.",

Global model output is provided for the period 0&amp;#8211;1999 AD on a horizontal resolution of approximately 187 km (1.875&amp;#176;&amp;#215; 1.875&amp;#176;longitude by latitude grid). The t2m extremes are defined as the events with mean summer temperature higher than the 95th percentile of the training period (0-1970 AD) and are calculated separately for each grid point of the European region between 35&amp;#186;N-70&amp;#186;N, 10&amp;#186;W-30&amp;#186;E. The algorithms are trained only with data from the training period and are set to predict the summer t2m extremes of the test period 1971-1999 AD. The predictor data used for fitting the algorithms are chosen based on their known influence as boundary forcings of European summer climate. The predictor variables include springtime sea surface temperature (SST) from the NA region (0&amp;#186;-76&amp;#186;N, 85&amp;#176;W-30&amp;#176;E) and springtime European soil moisture (SM). The skill of the predictions is evaluated based on the extremal dependence index (EDI), which depends on the hit rate and false alarm rate. The EDI values vary between -1 and 1, where 1 is the skill of a perfect forecast. The first algorithm tested is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on a random forest classifier (RF). RF predicts the highest EDI values over Scandinavia, Scotland and around the Mediterranean region (EDI&gt;0.5), with the SST predictor being the main contributor to that skill. The second algorithm tested, is an autoencoder neural network (AE) that learns data codings in an unsupervised manner. AE surpasses the RF skill above most European regions and predicts the highest EDI values over the southeast Mediterranean, Central Europe, and the British Isles. The AE neural network is also trained to predict the absolute value of the extreme t2m events. The skill of reproducing the absolute value of the target t2m extremes is evaluated with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), only for those extreme events that are reproduced by the AE prediction. The MAE values for the southeast Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and the British Isles are around 2 &amp;#186;C, 2.5 &amp;#186;C, and 1.5 &amp;#186;C, respectively. We have demonstrated the possibility of predicting a season in advance the occurrence of extreme summer t2m using an AE neural network. The AE neural network was tested in the virtual reality of a model simulation. The second step will be the application of the trained network on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;",

However, training deep learning models requires large amounts of data annotated by experts, whose collection is often time- and cost- prohibitive in the biomedical domain. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a prominent solution for these problems, as it allows to learn powerful data representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite most applications in biomedical research targeted images, the high amount of recent works targeting biosignals can make it difficult for researchers to have a complete picture of the current situation. The aim of this paper is to outline and clarify the state of the art in the domain. The article briefly summarizes the nature and acquisition modality of biomedical signals, introduces the SSL method, and provides a complete but synthetic overview of the main works applying SSL for the analysis of biomedical signals. The analysis of the scientific literature highlights the importance of SSL, confirming its potential to improve the integration of deep learning into clinical tasks. </p>",

        "abstract": "Traditional methods of mapping inland water bodies involve labor-intensive and manual data labeling, limiting their scalability to a larger extent. This study introduces a novel approach: self-supervised machine learning (SSML) for mapping inland water bodies. SSML is a training method where a model learns from data without the need for explicit human-labeled annotations. Using this technique, the study mapped inland water bodies in Pudukkottai, India, using LANDSAT-8 imagery from 2021. The training data for SSML were derived from two spectral indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. These indices were used to establish a threshold for automatically generating pseudo labels for two categories: water and non-water. This pseudo-labeled dataset was then utilized to train various machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, classification and regression tree, and gradient boosting. The accuracy of the final classified map was assessed using a spatial agreement test, which measures the degree of agreement of the classified map in relation to a reference dataset. The spatial agreement test used the Joint Research Commission (JRC) water map of 2021 as the reference dataset. The final inland water body map, derived from the SSML approach, demonstrated a high spatial agreement of 91% with the JRC water map. Among the SSML models, the random forest model outperformed others due to its ensemble nature. Compared to traditionally supervised classifiers (trained with 137 water points and 74 non-water points), the SSML models exhibited superior performance with a spatial agreement of 91%, significantly higher than the 67% achieved by the supervised model. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of SSML for mapping inland water bodies, offering an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional manual labeling. This approach holds significant potential for advancing remote sensing applications, particularly in regions where obtaining ground truth labeling is costly or impractical.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Diabetes is the deadliest chronic diseases in the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO) around 422 million people are currently suffering from diabetes, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Also, the number of deaths due to diabetes is close to 1.6 million. Recent research has proven that the occurrence of diabetes is likely to be seen in people aged between 18 and this has risen from 4.7 to 8.5% from 1980 to 2014. Early diagnosis is necessary so that the disease does not go into advanced stages which is quite difficult to cure. Significant research has been performed in diabetes predictions. As time passes, challenges keep increasing to build a system to detect diabetes systematically. The hype for Machine Learning is increasing day to day to analyse medical data to diagnose a disease. Previous research has focused on just identifying the diabetes without specifying its type. In this paper, we have we have predicted gestational diabetes (Type-3) by comparing various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms on two datasets i.e., binned and non-binned datasets and compared the performance based on evaluation metrics.

        "abstract": "SummaryA network embedding approach reduces the analysis complexity of large biological networks by converting them to lowdimensional vector representations (features/embeddings). These lower-dimensional vectors can then be used in machine learning prediction tasks with a wide range of applications in computational biology and bioinformatics. Several network embedding approaches have been proposed with different methods of generating vector representations. These network embedding approaches can be quite diverse in terms of data representation and implementation. Moreover, most were not originally developed for biological networks. Therefore comparing and assessing the performance of these diverse models in practice, in biological contexts, can be challenging. To facilitate such comparisons, we have developed the BioNE framework for integration of different embedding methods in prediction tasks. Using this framework one can easily assess, for instance, whether combined vector representations from multiple embedding methods offer complementary information with regards to the network features and thus better performance on prediction tasks. In this paper, we present the BioNE software suite for embedding integration, which applies network embedding methods following standardised network preparation steps, and integrates the vector representations achieved by these methods using three different techniques. BioNE enables selection of prediction models, oversampling methods, feature selection methods, cross-validation type and cross-validation parameters.Availability and implementationBioNE pipeline and detailed explanation of implementation is freely available on GitHub, athttps://github.com/pooryaparvizi/BioNE",

Various kinds of algorithms such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest algorithm are applied to identify type 2 diabetes. At this juncture, used the implementation of type 2 Classification by AdaBoost algorithms, an ensemble approach. Here, the proposed methodology of the paper is to implement an ensemble approach of machine learning to receive a better efficiency compared to other existing algorithms for the classification of type 2 diabetes. When compared to all different algorithms, this ensemble approach shows an efficiency of 83%. The accuracy is calculated based on various performance measures.",

As an alternative, in this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to learn the spatial anatomical representations from the frames of magnetic resonance (MR) video clips for the diagnosis of knee medical conditions. The pretext model learns meaningful spatial context-invariant representations. The downstream task in our paper is a class imbalanced multi-label classification. Different experiments show that the features learnt by the pretext model provide competitive performance in the downstream task. Moreover, the efficiency and reliability of the proposed pretext model in learning representations of minority classes without applying any strategy towards imbalance in the dataset can be seen from the results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work of its kind in showing the effectiveness and reliability of self-supervised learning algorithms in class imbalanced multi-label classification tasks on MR videos.</p>",

Although deep learning algorithms have the ability to outperform other methods, they rely on the availability of a large amount of annotated data. Motivated by the need to address this limitation, an approach to localisation and detection of multiple organs based on supervised and semi-supervised learning is presented here. It draws upon previous work by the authors on localising the thoracic and lumbar spine region in CT images. The method generates six bounding boxes of organs of interest, which are then fused to a single bounding box. The results of experiments on localisation of the Spleen, Left and Right Kidneys in CT Images using supervised and semi supervised learning (SSL) demonstrate the ability to address data limitations with a much smaller data set and fewer annotations, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The SSL performance was evaluated using three different mixes of labelled and unlabelled data (i.e. 30:70,35:65,40:60) for each of lumbar spine, spleen left and right kidneys respectively. The results indicate that SSL provides a workable alternative especially in medical imaging where it is difficult to obtain annotated data.",

However, the majority of those SNPs were found in non-coding genomic regions, preventing the understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. Predicting molecular processes based on the DNA sequence represents a promising approach to understand the role of those non-coding SNPs. Over the past years, deep learning was successfully applied to regulatory sequence prediction. Such method required DNA sequences associated with functional data for training. However, the human genome has a finite size which strongly limits the amount of DNA sequence with functional data available for training. Conversely, the amount of mammalian DNA sequences is exponentially increasing due to ongoing large sequencing projects, but without functional data in most cases. Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on graph neural network which allows to borrow information from homologous mammal sequences during training. Our approach can be plugged into any existing deep learning model and showed improvements in many different situations, including classification and regression, and for different types of functional data.",

SRBs are generally observed in dynamic spectra and have five major spectral classes, labelled type I to type V depending on their shape and extent in frequency and time. Due to their morphological complexity, a challenge in solar radio physics is the automatic detection and classification of such radio bursts. Classification of SRBs has become necessary in recent years due to large data rates (3 Gb/s) generated by advanced radio telescopes such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Here we test the ability of several supervised machine learning algorithms to automatically classify type II and type III solar radio bursts. We test the detection accuracy of support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), as well as an implementation of transfer learning of the Inception and YOLO convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The training data was assembled from type II and III bursts observed by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) from 1996 to 2018, supplemented by type II and III radio burst simulations. The CNNs were the best performers, often exceeding &gt;90% accuracy on the validation set, with YOLO having the ability to perform radio burst burst localisation in dynamic spectra. This shows that machine learning algorithms (in particular CNNs) are capable of SRB classification, and we conclude by discussing future plans for the implementation of a CNN in the LOFAR for Space Weather (LOFAR4SW) data-stream pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTWhile deep learning has revolutionized ecological data analysis, existing strategies often rely on supervised learning, which is subject to limitations on real-world applicability. In this paper, we apply self-supervised deep learning methods to bioacoustic data to enable unsupervised detection of bioacoustic event boundaries. We propose a convolutional deep neural network that operates on the raw waveform directly and is trained in accordance with the Noise Contrastive Estimation principle, which enables the system to detect spectral changes in the input acoustic stream. The model learns a representation of the input audio sampled at low frequency that encodes information regarding dissimilarity between sequential acoustic windows. During inference, we use a peak finding algorithm to search for regions of high dissimilarity in order to identify temporal boundaries of bioacoustic events. We report results using these techniques to detect sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) coda clicks in real-world recordings, and we demonstrate the viability of analyzing the vocalizations of other species (e.g. Bengalese finch syllable segmentation) in addition to other data modalities (e.g. animal behavioral dynamics, embryo development and tracking). We find that the self-supervised deep representation learning-based technique outperforms established threshold-based baseline methods without requiring manual annotation of acoustic datasets. Quantitatively, our approach yields a maximal R-value and F1-score of 0.887 and 0.876, respectively, and an area under the Precision-Recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.917, while a baseline threshold detector acting on signal energy amplitude returns a maximal R-value and F1-score of 0.620 and 0.576, respectively, and a PR-AUC of 0.571. We also compare with a threshold detector using preprocessed (e.g. denoised) acoustic input. The findings of this paper establish the validity of unsupervised bioacoustic event detection using deep neural networks and self-supervised contrastive learning as an effective alternative to conventional techniques that leverage supervised methods for signal presence indication. Providing a means for highly accurate unsupervised detection, this paper serves as an important step towards developing a fully automated system for real-time acoustic monitoring of bioacoustic signals in real-world acoustic data.

Deriving these models is challenging for several reasons, perhaps the most daunting being the limited number of already-diagnosed, ‘labeled’ patients from which to learn. We overcome this obstacle with a novel lightly-supervised algorithm that leverages unlabeled and/or unreliably-labeled patient data – which is typically plentiful – to facilitate model induction. Importantly, we prove the algorithm issafe:adding unlabeled/unreliably-labeled data to the learning procedure produces models which are usually more accurate, and guaranteed never to be less accurate, than models learned from reliably-labeled data alone. The proposed method is shown to substantially outperform state-of-the-art models in patient-finding experiments involving two different rare diseases and a country-scale EHR database. Additionally, we demonstrate feasibility of transforming high-performance models generated through light supervision into simpler models which, while still accurate, are readily-interpretable by non-experts.",

However, theoretical ML concepts and predictive modeling techniques are not yet widely taught in psychology programs. This tutorial is intended to provide an intuitive but thorough primer and introduction to supervised ML for psychologists in four consecutive modules. After introducing the basic terminology and mindset of supervised ML, Module I covers how to use resampling methods to evaluate the performance of ML models (bias-variance tradeoff, performance measures, k-fold cross-validation). Module II introduces the nonlinear random forest, a type of ML model that is particularly user-friendly and well-suited to predicting psychological outcomes. Module III is about performing empirical benchmark experiments (comparing the performance of several ML models on multiple datasets). Finally, Module IV discusses the interpretation of ML models, including permutation variable importance measures, effect plots (partial dependence plots, individual conditional expectation profiles), and the concept of model fairness. Throughout the tutorial, intuitive descriptions of theoretical concepts are provided, with as few mathematical formulas as possible, and followed by code examples, using the mlr3 and companion packages in R. Key practical analysis steps are demonstrated on the publicly available PhoneStudy dataset (N = 624), which includes over 1800 variables from smartphone sensing to predict Big Five personality trait scores. The manuscript contains a checklist to be used as a reminder of important elements when performing, reporting, or reviewing ML analyses in psychology.

        "abstract": "AbstractGene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgression has been described in numerous genomic datasets. Among distantly related taxa, however, it is difficult to differentiate these biological sources of discordance from discordance due to errors in gene tree reconstruction, even when supervised machine learning techniques are used to infer individual gene trees. Here, rather than applying machine learning to the problem of inferring single tree topologies, we develop a model to infer important properties of a particular internal branch of the species tree via genome-scale summary statistics extracted from individual alignments and inferred gene trees. We show that our model can effectively predict the presence/absence of discordance, estimate the probability of discordance, and infer the correct species tree topology in the presence of multiple, common sources of error. While gene tree topology counts are the most salient predictors of discordance at short time scales, other genomic features become relevant for distantly related species. We validate our approach through simulation, and apply it to data from the deepest splits among metazoans. Our results suggest that the base of Metazoa experienced significant gene tree discordance, implying that discordant traits among current taxa can be explained without invoking homoplasy. In addition, we find support for Porifera as the sister clade to the rest of Metazoa. Overall, these results demonstrate how machine learning can be used to answer important phylogenetic questions, while marginalizing over individual gene tree—and even species tree—topologies.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The most critical aspect of application of digital soil mapping is its limited transferability. Modelling soil properties for regions where no or only sparse soil information is available is highly uncertain, when using the low-cost geo-spatial environmental covariates alone. To overcome this drawback, transfer learning has been introduced in different environmental sciences, including soil science. The general idea behind extrapolation of soil information with transfer learning in soil science is that the target area to transfer to is alike, e.g. in terms of soil-forming factors, and the same machine learning rules can be applied. Supervised machine learning, so far, has been used to transfer the soil information from the reference to the target areas with very similar environmental characteristics between both. Hence, it is unclear how machine learning can perform for other target regions with different environmental characteristics. Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data (reference area) with a large amount of unlabeled data (target area) during training. In this study, we explored if semi-supervised learning could improve the transferability of digital soil mapping relative to supervised learning methods. Soil data for two arid regions and associated environmental covariates were obtained. Semi-supervised learning and supervised learning models were trained based on the data in the reference area and then tested based on the data in the target area. The results of this study indicated the higher power of semi-supervised learning for transferring soil information from one area to another in comparison to the supervised learning method.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;",

This development easily expands the data size and its complexity for data analysis, where one of it is to label similar dispersion cuts and map them spatially. In this work, we demonstrate that the recent development in representational learning (self-supervised learning) model combined with k-means clustering can help automate that part of data analysis and save precious time, albeit with low performance. Finally, we introduce a few-shot learning (k-nearest neighbour or kNN) in representational space where we selectively choose one (k=1) image reference for each known label and subsequently label the rest of the data with respect to the nearest reference image. This last approach demonstrates the strength of the self-supervised learning to automate the image analysis in ARPES in particular and can be generalized into any science data analysis that heavily involves image data.",

        "abstract": "Traffic sign recognition is a classification problem that poses challenges for computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Although both computer vision and machine learning techniques have constantly been improved to solve this problem, the sudden rise in the number of unlabeled traffic signs has become even more challenging. Large data collation and labeling are tedious and expensive tasks that demand much time, expert knowledge, and fiscal resources to satisfy the hunger of deep neural networks. Aside from that, the problem of having unbalanced data also poses a greater challenge to computer vision and machine learning algorithms to achieve better performance. These problems raise the need to develop algorithms that can fully exploit a large amount of unlabeled data, use a small amount of labeled samples, and be robust to data imbalance to build an efficient and high-quality classifier. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised classification technique that is robust to small and unbalanced data. The framework integrates weakly-supervised learning and self-training with self-paced learning to generate attention maps to augment the training set and utilizes a novel pseudo-label generation and selection algorithm to generate and select pseudo-labeled samples. The method improves the performance by: (1) normalizing the class-wise confidence levels to prevent the model from ignoring hard-to-learn samples, thereby solving the imbalanced data problem; (2) jointly learning a model and optimizing pseudo-labels generated on unlabeled data; and (3) enlarging the training set to satisfy the hunger of deep learning models. Extensive evaluations on two public traffic sign recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique and provide a potential solution for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;In order to predict the timing of extreme summer seasons in terms of 2 meters surface temperature (t2m), two algorithms are applied in the output of a global paleoclimate simulation. The model simulation is conducted with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model configuration for paleoclimate (MPI-ESM-P). Global model output is provided for the period 0&amp;#8211;1999 AD on a horizontal resolution of approximately 187 km (1.875&amp;#176;&amp;#215; 1.875&amp;#176;longitude by latitude grid). The t2m extremes are defined as the events with mean summer temperature higher than the 95th percentile of the training period (0-1970 AD) and are calculated separately for each grid point of the European region between 35&amp;#186;N-70&amp;#186;N, 10&amp;#186;W-30&amp;#186;E. The algorithms are trained only with data from the training period and are set to predict the summer t2m extremes of the test period 1971-1999 AD. The predictor data used for fitting the algorithms are chosen based on their known influence as boundary forcings of European summer climate. The predictor variables include springtime sea surface temperature (SST) from the NA region (0&amp;#186;-76&amp;#186;N, 85&amp;#176;W-30&amp;#176;E) and springtime European soil moisture (SM). The skill of the predictions is evaluated based on the extremal dependence index (EDI), which depends on the hit rate and false alarm rate. The EDI values vary between -1 and 1, where 1 is the skill of a perfect forecast. The first algorithm tested is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on a random forest classifier (RF). RF predicts the highest EDI values over Scandinavia, Scotland and around the Mediterranean region (EDI&gt;0.5), with the SST predictor being the main contributor to that skill. The second algorithm tested, is an autoencoder neural network (AE) that learns data codings in an unsupervised manner. AE surpasses the RF skill above most European regions and predicts the highest EDI values over the southeast Mediterranean, Central Europe, and the British Isles. The AE neural network is also trained to predict the absolute value of the extreme t2m events. The skill of reproducing the absolute value of the target t2m extremes is evaluated with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), only for those extreme events that are reproduced by the AE prediction. The MAE values for the southeast Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and the British Isles are around 2 &amp;#186;C, 2.5 &amp;#186;C, and 1.5 &amp;#186;C, respectively. We have demonstrated the possibility of predicting a season in advance the occurrence of extreme summer t2m using an AE neural network. The AE neural network was tested in the virtual reality of a model simulation. The second step will be the application of the trained network on observational data.&lt;/p&gt;",

The aim of this paper is to outline and clarify the state of the art in the domain. The article briefly summarizes the nature and acquisition modality of biomedical signals, introduces the SSL method, and provides a complete but synthetic overview of the main works applying SSL for the analysis of biomedical signals.

        "abstract": "Traditional methods of mapping inland water bodies involve labor-intensive and manual data labeling, limiting their scalability to a larger extent. This study introduces a novel approach: self-supervised machine learning (SSML) for mapping inland water bodies. SSML is a training method where a model learns from data without the need for explicit human-labeled annotations. Using this technique, the study mapped inland water bodies in Pudukkottai, India, using LANDSAT-8 imagery from 2021. The training data for SSML were derived from two spectral indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index. These indices were used to establish a threshold for automatically generating pseudo labels for two categories: water and non-water. This pseudo-labeled dataset was then utilized to train various machine learning models, including random forest, support vector machine, classification and regression tree, and gradient boosting. The accuracy of the final classified map was assessed using a spatial agreement test, which measures the degree of agreement of the classified map in relation to a reference dataset. The spatial agreement test used the Joint Research Commission (JRC) water map of 2021 as the reference dataset. The final inland water body map, derived from the SSML approach, demonstrated a high spatial agreement of 91% with the JRC water map. Among the SSML models, the random forest model outperformed others due to its ensemble nature. Compared to traditionally supervised classifiers (trained with 137 water points and 74 non-water points), the SSML models exhibited superior performance with a spatial agreement of 91%, significantly higher than the 67% achieved by the supervised model. This study is the first to demonstrate the application of SSML for mapping inland water bodies, offering an efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional manual labeling. This approach holds significant potential for advancing remote sensing applications, particularly in regions where obtaining ground truth labeling is costly or impractical.",

For a wide variety of scientific fields, unlabeled examples are easy to collect but hard to handle in a useful manner, thus improving the contained information for a subject dataset. In this context, a variety of learning methods have been studied in the literature aiming to efficiently utilize the vast amounts of unlabeled data during the learning process. The most common approaches tackle problems of this kind by individually applying active learning or semi-supervised learning methods. In this work, a combination of active learning and semi-supervised learning methods is proposed, under a common self-training scheme, in order to efficiently utilize the available unlabeled data. The effective and robust metrics of the entropy and the distribution of probabilities of the unlabeled set, to select the most sufficient unlabeled examples for the augmentation of the initial labeled set, are used. The superiority of the proposed scheme is validated by comparing it against the base approaches of supervised, semi-supervised, and active learning in the wide range of fifty-five benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to leveraging features learned from both supervised and self-supervised paradigms, to improve image classification tasks, specifically for vehicle classification. Two state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods, DINO and data2vec, were evaluated and compared for their representation learning of vehicle images. The former contrasts local and global views while the latter uses masked prediction on multiple layered representations. In the latter case, supervised learning is employed to finetune a pretrained YOLOR object detector for detecting vehicle wheels, from which definitive wheel positional features are retrieved. The representations learned from these self-supervised learning methods were combined with the wheel positional features for the vehicle classification task. Particularly, a random wheel masking strategy was utilized to finetune the previously learned representations in harmony with the wheel positional features during the training of the classifier. Our experiments show that the data2vec-distilled representations, which are consistent with our wheel masking strategy, outperformed the DINO counterpart, resulting in a celebrated Top-1 classification accuracy of 97.2% for classifying the 13 vehicle classes defined by the Federal Highway Administration.",

This study assesses the current fraud detection research in this area to detect the employed algorithms and assessing in accordance with predetermined standards.

        "abstract": "Deep learning and computer vision have become emerging tools for diseased plant phenotyping. Most previous studies focused on image-level disease classification. In this paper, pixel-level phenotypic feature (the distribution of spot) was analyzed by deep learning. Primarily, a diseased leaf dataset was collected and the corresponding pixel-level annotation was contributed. A dataset of apple leaves samples was used for training and optimization. Another set of grape and strawberry leaf samples was used as an extra testing dataset. Then, supervised convolutional neural networks were adopted for semantic segmentation. Moreover, the possibility of weakly supervised models for disease spot segmentation was also explored. Grad-CAM combined with ResNet-50 (ResNet-CAM), and that combined with a few-shot pretrained U-Net classifier for weakly supervised leaf spot segmentation (WSLSS), was designed. They were trained using image-level annotations (healthy versus diseased) to reduce the cost of annotation work. Results showed that the supervised DeepLab achieved the best performance (IoU = 0.829) on the apple leaf dataset. The weakly supervised WSLSS achieved an IoU of 0.434. When processing the extra testing dataset, WSLSS realized the best IoU of 0.511, which was even higher than fully supervised DeepLab (IoU = 0.458). Although there was a certain gap in IoU between the supervised models and weakly supervised ones, WSLSS showed stronger generalization ability than supervised models when processing the disease types not involved in the training procedure. Furthermore, the contributed dataset in this paper could help researchers get a quick start on designing their new segmentation methods in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised learning has made substantial progress over the last few years, especially by means of contrastive self-supervised learning. The dominating dataset for benchmarking self-supervised learning has been ImageNet, for which recent methods are approaching the performance achieved by fully supervised training. The ImageNet dataset is however largely object-centric, and it is not clear yet what potential those methods have on widely different datasets and tasks that are not object-centric, such as in digital pathology. While self-supervised learning has started to be explored within this area with encouraging results, there is reason to look closer at how this setting differs from natural images and ImageNet. In this paper we make an in-depth analysis of contrastive learning for histopathology, pin-pointing how the contrastive objective will behave differently due to the characteristics of histopathology data. Using SimCLR and H&E stained images as a representative setting for contrastive self-supervised learning in histopathology, we bring forward a number of considerations, such as view generation for the contrastive objective and hyper-parameter tuning. In a large battery of experiments, we analyze how the downstream performance in tissue classification will be affected by these considerations. The results point to how contrastive learning can reduce the annotation effort within digital pathology, but that the specific dataset characteristics need to be considered. To take full advantage of the contrastive learning objective, different calibrations of view generation and hyper-parameters are required. Our results pave the way for realizing the full potential of self-supervised learning for histopathology applications.

        "abstract": "Applications of Machine Learning to the geosciences are increasing in numbers during the last two decades because of its computation power. In this work we propose a method to estimate the basement depth from gravity data using a supervised machine learning approach. We used the Bishop synthetic model to represent a variety of examples of input &#8211; target (i.e., gravity data &#8211; depth of the basement) training dataset. We so generated a large set of examples, using an overlapping moving window along the profiles in the N-S and E-W direction, associating the corresponding depth values of the basement to each of the windows. Due to its data-driven nature, the neural networks perform better as the number of examples provided in the training phase increases. However, increasing the number of examples leads to a higher computational cost in terms of speed and hardware needed. In the Big Data era this is not a huge issue, thanks to the increasingly present services of cloud computing. We found a good compromise on an average machine between speed and performance by using about 300k examples. A trial-and-error approach was used to find the hyperparameters that have the best compromise between performance and computation time.We used, as a testing dataset, the gravity data due to a surface modelled from the Himalaya region DEM, with noisy and noise-free data. We found that this avoided overfitting and helped to verify the ability of the trained network to generalize to other cases, even with noisy data. The method was successfully applied also to a real dataset case: the isostatic anomaly of the Yucca Flat sedimentary basin (Nevada, USA) showing good agreement with previous inverse-modelling of the data, even if the author consider a set of layers with increasing density vs. depth, while in our case we used a mean density contrast of -0.7 g/cm3.",

While dysregulated gene sets are identified via pathway analysis, various machine learning models have been proposed for predicting phenotypes such as disease type and drug response based on gene expression patterns. However, these models still lack interpretability, as well as the ability to integrate prior knowledge from a protein-protein interaction network.ResultsWe propose Grandline, a graph convolutional neural network that can integrate gene expression data and structure of the protein interaction network to predict a specific phenotype. Transforming the interaction network into a spectral domain enables convolution of neighbouring genes and pinpointing high-impact subnetworks, which allow better interpretability of deep learning models. Grandline achieves high phenotype prediction accuracy (67-85% in 8 use cases), comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning models while requiring a smaller number of parameters, allowing it to learn complex but interpretable gene expression patterns from biological datasets.ConclusionTo improve the interpretability of phenotype prediction based on gene expression patterns, we developed Grandline using graph convolutional neural network technique to integrate protein interaction information. We focus on improving the ability to learn nonlinear relationships between gene expression patterns and a given phenotype and incorporation of prior knowledge, which are the main challenges of machine learning models for biological datasets. The graph convolution allows us to aggregate information from relevant genes and reduces the number of trainable parameters, facilitating model training for a small-sized biological dataset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDrug discovery is incredibly time-consuming and expensive, averaging over 10 years and $985 million per drug. Calculating the binding affinity between a target protein and a ligand is critical for discovering viable drugs. Although supervised machine learning (ML) models can predict binding affinity accurately, they suffer from lack of interpretability and inaccurate feature selection caused by multicollinear data. This study used self-supervised ML to reveal underlying protein-ligand characteristics that strongly influence binding affinity. Protein-ligand 3D models were collected from the PDBBind database and vectorized into 2422 features per complex. LASSO Regression and hierarchical clustering were utilized to minimize multicollinearity between features. Correlation analyses and Autoencoder-based latent space representations were generated to identify features significantly influencing binding affinity. A Generative Adversarial Network was used to simulate ligands with certain counts of a significant feature, and thereby determine the effect of a feature on improving binding affinity with a given target protein. It was found that the CC and CCCN fragment counts in the ligand notably influence binding affinity. Re-pairing proteins with simulated ligands that had higher CC and CCCN fragment counts could increase binding affinity by 34.99-37.62% and 36.83%-36.94%, respectively. This discovery contributes to a more accurate representation of ligand chemistry that can increase the accuracy, explainability, and generalizability of ML models so that they can more reliably identify novel drug candidates. Directions for future work include integrating knowledge on ligand fragments into supervised ML models, examining the effect of CC and CCCN fragments on fragment-based drug design, and employing computational techniques to elucidate the chemical activity of these fragments.",

        "abstract": "Ice crystals play a crucial role in precipitation formation and radiation budget, with their various shapes influencing these processes differently. The shape of ice crystals is related to the environmental conditions (i.e. temperature) under which the ice crystal forms and the microphysical processes that ice crystal experiences. Therefore, ice crystal shape classification is important for understanding conditions and microphysical processes in cloud. However, current methods are mainly supervised learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), heavily relying on extensive manual labelling, which requires substantial labor. Moreover, the limitations in human&#8217;s knowledge of ice crystals and the bias of human subjectivity in classification hinder the generalization ability of these networks. In response to these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm for ice crystal classification. We use data from the 2019 Ny-&#197;lesund NASCENT campaign, collected by a holographic imager mounted on the balloon-borne platform HoloBalloon, which includes 18,864 ice crystal images. In our algorithm we initially extract key features from ice crystal images using an unsupervised learning network, prioritizing generalization rather than dependence on labelled data, which ensures unbiased feature identification. Subsequently, a small subset of images is manually labelled into nineteen categories based on a multi-label classification scheme that consider both basic habits and microphysical processes. The classification accuracy of our hybrid algorithm on nineteen categories is similar to the performance supervised learning algorithm. This hybrid algorithm not only reduces the labor needed for manual labelling but also incorporates physics-based constraints, which prevents the network from making unfounded assumptions, thus offering a robust and efficient framework for ice crystal classification.",

        "abstract": "Clouds are classified into types, classes, or regimes. The World Meteorological Organization distinguishes stratus and cumulus clouds and three altitude layers. Cloud types exhibit very different radiative properties and interact in numerous ways with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. However, it has proven difficult to define cloud regimes objectively and from remote sensing data, hindering the understanding we have of the processes and adjustments involved.Building on the method we previously developed, we combine synoptic observations and passive satellite remote-sensing retrievals to constitute a database of cloud types and cloud properties to eventually train a cloud classification algorithm. The cloud type labels come from the global marine meteorological observations dataset (UK Met Office, 2006) which is comprised of near-global synoptic observations. This data record reports back information about cloud type and other meteorological quantities at the surface. The cloud classification model is built on different cloud-top and cloud optical properties (Level 2 products MOD06/MYD06 from the MODIS sensor) extracted temporally close to the observation time and on a 128km x 128km grid around the synoptic observation location. To make full use of the large quantity of remote sensing data available and to investigate the variety in cloud settings, a convolutional variational auto-encoder (VAE) is applied as a dimensionality reduction tool in a first step. Furthermore, such model architecture allows to account for spatial relationships while describing non-linear patterns in the input data. The cloud classification task is subsequently performed drawing on the constructed latent representation of the VAE. Associating information from underneath and above the cloud enables to build a robust model to classify cloud types. For the training we specify a study domain in the Atlantic ocean around the equator and evaluate the method globally. Further experiments and evaluation are done on simulation data produced by the ICON model.",

        "abstract": "Although deep learning has achieved great success in image classification, large amounts of labelled data are needed to make full use of the advantages of deep learning. However, annotating a large number of images is expensive and time-consuming, especially annotating medical images, which requires professional knowledge. Therefore, semi-supervised learning has shown its potential for medical image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labelling semi-supervised learning method for medical image classification. Firstly, we utilize the anti-curriculum strategy for model training to prevent the model from producing predictions with a high value from the samples which are similar with existed labeled data. Secondly, to produce more stable and accurate pseudo labels for unlabeled data, we generate the pseudo labels with ensemble predictions provided by the model with samples augmented by different augmentations. In addition, we refine the generated pseudo labels using the prediction of the model at the current epoch in order to make the model learn from itself and improve the model performance. Comparative experiments on the Chest X-ray14 dataset for a multi-label classification task and the ISIC 2018 dataset for a multi-class classification task are performed, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhole transcriptome studies typically yield large amounts of data, with expression values for all genes or transcripts of the genome. The search for genes of interest in a particular study setting can thus be a daunting task, usually relying on automated computational methods. Moreover, most biological questions imply that such a search should be performed in a multivariate setting, to take into account the inter-genes relationships.Differential expression analysis commonly yields large lists of genes deemed significant, even after adjustment for multiple testing, making the subsequent study possibilities extensive.Here, we explore the use of supervised learning methods to rank large ensembles of genes defined by their expression values measured with RNA-Seq in a typical 2 classes sample set. First, we use one of the variable importance measures generated by the random forests classification algorithm as a metric to rank genes. Second, we define the EPS (extreme pseudo-samples) pipeline, making use of VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) and regressors to extract a ranking of genes while leveraging the feature space of both virtual and comparable samples.We show that, on 12 cancer RNA-Seq data sets ranging from 323 to 1210 samples, using either a random forests based gene selection method or the EPS pipeline outperforms differential expression analysis for 9 and 8 out of the 12 datasets respectively, in terms of identifying subsets of genes associated with survival.These results demonstrate the potential of supervised learning-based gene selection methods in RNA-Seq studies and highlight the need to use such multivariate gene selection methods alongside the widely used differential expression analysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMelanoma is one of the most fatal forms of skin cancer and is often very difficult to differentiate from other benign skin lesions. However, if detected at its early stages, it can almost always be cured. Researchers and data scientists have studied this disease in-depth with the help of large datasets containing high-quality dermascopic images, such as those assembled by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). However, these images often lack diversity and over-represent patients with very common skin features such as light skin and having no visible body hair. In this study, we introduce a novel architecture called LatentNet which automatically detects over-represented features and reduces their weights during training. We tested our model on four distinct categories - three skin color levels corresponding to Type I, II, and III on the Fitzpatrick Scale, and images containing visible hair. We then compared the accuracy against the conventional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model trained using the standard approach (i.e. without detecting over-represented features) and containing the same hyper-parameters as the LatentNet. LatentNet showed significant performance improvement over the standard DCNN model with accuracy of 89.52%, 79.05%, 64.31%, and 64.35% compared to the DCNN accuracy of 90.41%, 70.82%, 45.28%, 56.52% in the corresponding categories, respectively. Differences in the average performance between the models were statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting that the proposed model successfully reduced bias amongst the tested categories. LatentNet is the first architecture that addresses racial bias (and other sources of bias) in deep-learning based Melanoma diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Directional discontinuities (DDs) are defined as abrupt changes of the magnetic field orientation. We use observations from ESA&#8217;s Cluster mission to compile a database of 4216 events identified in January-April 2007 and 5194 events from January-April 2008. Localized time-scale images depicting angular changes are created for each event, and a preliminary classification algorithm is designed to distinguish between: simple - isolated events, and complex - multiple overlapping events. In 2007, 1806 events are pre-classified as simple, and 2410 as complex; in 2008, 1997 events are simple, and 3197 are complex. &#160;A supervised machine learning approach is used to recognize and predict these events. Two models are trained: one for 2007, which is used to predict the results in 2008, and vice versa for 2008. To validate our results, we investigate the discontinuity occurrence rate as a function of spacecraft location. When the spacecraft is in the solar wind, we find an occurrence rate of similar to 2 DDs per hour and a 50/50% ratio of simple/complex events. When the spacecraft is in the Earth's magnetosheath, we find that the total occurrence rate remains around 2 DDs/hr, but the ratio of simple/complex events changes to similar to 25/75%. This implies that about half of the simple events observed in the solar wind are classified as complex when observed in the magnetosheath. This demonstrates that our classification scheme can provide meaningful insights, and thus be relevant for future studies on interplanetary discontinuities.

        "abstract": "AbstractVariant allele frequencies (VAF) encode ongoing evolution and subclonal selection in growing tumours. However, existing methods that utilize VAF information for cancer evolutionary inference are compressive, slow, or incorrectly specify the underlying cancer evolutionary dynamics. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method, TumE, that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks, to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. Analyses in synthetic and patient tumours show that TumE significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Importantly, we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks — substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community. This extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and, in turn, the cancer patient. TumE is publicly available for use at https://github.com/tomouellette/TumE.",

        "abstract": "<p>Neural networks have been commonly used in different domains. Hardware implementation of the neural networks is challenging to fit different applications’ requirements. This often necessitates realizing different neural network FPGA configurations from the very scratch specific to a given application. This paper proposes a flexible method that can be reconfigured in a self-supervised way to fit several ap?plications’ requirements, by providing only maximum available computational nodes a prior. The proposed method is based on reconfiguring the required number of hidden layers and hidden nodes of that layer based on a given application. Reconfigurability also allows to decide and update the number of active nodes, at layer (l+1), which receives computational results of l th layer nodes. A configuration block is used to send a signal to the control block which follows each node output. The control block decides which following nodes receive the output according to the corresponding signal value from the configuration block. Each node receives a signal to be enabled or disabled from the configuration block. Therefore, the number of inputs of each node and nodes in each layer is determined according to the desired performance. The goal here is to automatically propose the optimal NN configuration through reconfigurability to fit different applications, to achieve the maximum accuracy possible. The optimality can be demonstrated in terms of minimum average power, average delay, and area overhead as well as maximum throughput and accuracy. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the reusability of the optimized architecture (which is self-learned online) for the very first application/dataset, as the initial configuration for any new/next dataset/application rather than starting from scratch. We have demonstrated with experimental results, the proposed approach helps primarily to significantly reduce optimized architecture search cost (the number of online training iterations) as well as associated average power consumption for successive datasets/applications. Our proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed method is verified against two different classification problems, MNIST and CIFAR-10. Our proposed reconfigurable method demonstrates stable accuracy of 98.97% and 98.95% against the state-of-the-art neural network with two different fixed configurations as (98.85% and 73.0%) for MNIST and (93.47% and 70.21%) for CIFAR-10, respectively. The proposed method also demonstrates a 20.9% reduction in average power dissipation against the state-of-the-art method. The proposed method is implemented and tested using VHDL and Altera FPGA.

Are top-down category-level forces critical for arriving at this representation, or can this representation be formed purely through domain-general learning of natural image structure? Here we present a fully self-supervised model which learns to represent individual images, rather than categories, such that views of the same image are embedded nearby in a low-dimensional feature space, distinctly from other recently encountered views. We find (i) category information implicitly emerges in the local similarity structure of this feature space, and (ii) these models learn hierarchical features which capture the structure of brain responses across the human ventral visual stream, on par with category-supervised models. These results provide computational support for a domain-general framework guiding the formation of visual representation, where the proximate goal is not explicitly about category information, but is instead to learn unique, compressed descriptions of the visual world.",

The Peekaboo attack was created to compromise DNP3 traffic, in which a man-in-the-middle on a communication link can capture and drop selected encrypted DNP3 messages by using support vector machine learning algorithms. The communication networks of smart grids are a important part of their infrastructure, so it is of critical importance to keep this communication secure and reliable. The main contribution of this paper is to compare the use of machine learning techniques to classify messages of the same protocol exchanged in encrypted tunnels. The study considers four simulated cases of encrypted DNP3 traffic scenarios and four different supervised machine learning algorithms: Decision tree, nearest-neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. The results obtained show that it is possible to extend a Peekaboo attack over multiple substations, using a decision tree learning algorithm, and to gather significant information from a system that communicates using encrypted DNP3 traffic.",

This article provides an in-depth overview of our methodology, data collection process, model implementations, evaluation metrics, and potential applications of our research findings. The research indicates that NBeats and NHits models exhibit superior performance in financial forecasting tasks, especially with limited data, while Transformers require more data to reach full potential. Our findings offer insights into the strengths of different ML techniques for financial prediction, highlighting specialized models like NBeats and NHits as top performers — thus informing model selection for real-world applications.\n",

We used accuracy and the Receiver operating curve to compare the methods. 60% of the data were used for training, 20% for validation and 20% for testing. We used JASP 0.16.04 by the University of Amsterdam to run machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis.ResultsWe used data from 504 patients who have undergone gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatic biliary surgery between April 2016 and March 2023. We analyzed algorithms for predicting 90 days post-operative mortality based on features like Major surgeries, Surgeries for malignancies, age, CDC grade of surgeries, Intraoperative hypotension, Open vs Laparoscopic surgeries, ASA grade, Emergency surgeries, Operative time, Intraoperative blood product used, colorectal surgeries, small intestinal surgeries, HPB surgeries, upper gastrointestinal surgeries and hernia. Test accuracies were 96% for gradient boosting, 90 % for K-nearest neighbours, 96% for the random forest, 94% for support vector and Areas under the ROC curve were 0.802 for gradient boosting, 0.489 for K-nearest neighbours, 0.934 for random forest and 0.5 for support vector algorithms. Accuracy and Area under the ROC curve with standard logistic regression method were 94% and 0.757. Features of importance in decreasing order were ASA, operative times, blood products, small bowel surgeries and Age.ConclusionSupervised machine learning algorithms particularly gradient boosting and random forest predicted 90 days post-operative mortality more accurately than logistic regression and such models can be part of the preoperative evaluation in gastrointestinal and HPB surgeries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nConservation management to mitigate extinction of wildlife becomes more crucial than ever as global impacts due to anthropogenic activities and climate change continue to create devastation for species around the globe. Despite ongoing efforts to understand species constantly changing population dynamics due to anthropogenic stressors, there is a strong disconnect between conservation research and conservation policy, what is known as the “Conservation Gap”. The International Union of Conservation of Nature, the IUCN, is a globally recognized organization that works to sustain biodiversity by maintaining a ranking of species known as their Red List. However, the IUCN does not currently utilize genetic information to assess species conservation status despite the availability of molecular data. Here we use over 7300 studies collated from the MacroPopGen database, and over 450 published articles from the public repository DataDryad, focused on conservation and population genetics, sampling across a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, and using IUCN classifications to predict species endangerment using machine learning. Our models were able to accurately predict species threat level classified by the IUCN using both measures of genetic diversity and differentiation with IUCN assessment criteria. Our goal is to use these models to help determine and communicate conservation status to practitioners that takes into consideration all available species-specific information.",

Based on the learning technique, supervised learning can be distinguished using a dataset (training data) that is already labeled, while unsupervised learning draws conclusions based on the dataset. The input in the form of a dataset is used by machine learning to produce the correct analysis. The problem to be solved by iris flowers (iris tectorum), which has flowers of various colors and has sepals and petals that indicate the species of flowers, requires an appropriate method for grouping these flowers into iris-setosa, iris-versicolor or iris-virginica species. The solution is used by Python, which provides the algorithms and libraries used to make machine learning. The solution with the supervised learning technique was chosen by the KNN Clasiffier algorithm and the unsupervised learning technique was selected by the DBSCAN Clustering algorithm. The results obtained by Python provide a complete library of numPy, Pandas, matplotlib, sklearn to create machine learning programming with KNN algorithms calling from sklearn import neighbors including supervised techniques, and DBSCAN calling from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN including unsupervised learning techniques. Python's ability to provide output according to the input in the dataset results in decisions in the form of classification and clustering.\r\n \r\nKeywords: DBSCAN, KNN, machine learning, python.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nPrecision medicine for cancer treatment relies on an accurate pathological diagnosis. The number of known tumor classes has increased rapidly, and reliance on traditional methods of histopathologic classification alone has become unfeasible. To help reduce variability, validation costs, and standardize the histopathological diagnostic process, supervised machine learning models using DNA-methylation data have been developed for tumor classification. These methods require large labeled training data sets to obtain clinically acceptable classification accuracy. While there is abundant unlabeled epigenetic data across multiple databases, labeling pathology data for machine learning models is time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for rare tumor types. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have been used to maximize the utility of labeled and unlabeled data for classification tasks and are effectively applied in genomics. SSL methods have not yet been explored with epigenetic data nor demonstrated beneficial to central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification.\n\nResults\nThis paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning on methylation data to improve the accuracy of supervised learning models in classifying CNS tumors. We comprehensively evaluated 11 SSL methods and developed a novel combination approach that included a self-training with editing using support vector machine (SETRED-SVM) model and an L2-penalized, multinomial logistic regression model to obtain high confidence labels from a few labeled instances. Results across eight random forest and neural net models show that the pseudo-labels derived from our SSL method can significantly increase prediction accuracy for 82 CNS tumors and 9 normal controls.\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed combination of semi-supervised technique and multinomial logistic regression holds the potential to leverage the abundant publicly available unlabeled methylation data effectively. Such an approach is highly beneficial in providing additional training examples, especially for scarce tumor types, to boost the prediction accuracy of supervised models.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe current standard for monitoring blood glucose levels in diabetes patients are continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, which are costly and carry the risk of complications, such as allergic reactions or skin irritations from the adhesive used to attach the CGM sensor to the skin. CGM devices are also highly visible and can thus act as a discomforting disease-marker for diabetes patients. To mitigate these issues, we develop and test a novel method that is able to predict blood glucose levels with only non-invasive predictor variables and a very small number of target variable measurements by using individualization and self-supervised deep learning. Using only a single blood glucose measurements per week, our method (6387.47 glucose-specific MSE) outperforms traditional deep learning performed with hourly measurements (8191.23 glucose-specific MSE). Across eight experiments where blood glucose measurements are more than one hour apart, our approach outperforms traditional deep learning without exception. Our findings suggest that self-supervised, individualized deep learning could provide an avenue towards alternatives to CGM devices that would be less costly, non-invasive, and thus more accessible.",

        "abstract": "Researchers are increasingly utilizing Deep Learning methods for computer vision to identify and quantify floating macroplastic litter. While these methods can provide precise assessments of plastic pollution by automatically processing images and videos, they often rely on the availability of large amount of annotated data for supervised learning (SL). Moreover, the manual labeling work is expensive and time-consuming. This hinders obtaining high model generalization capability, which is essential for the development of robust computer vision systems for structural monitoring.To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for detecting floating macroplastic litter based on the SwAV (Swapping Assignments between multiple Views of the same image) approach. SwAV is a self-supervised learning method that extracts the feature representations of data (such as images with macroplastic litter) without manual annotations. In the first stage of the SSL method, we use SwAV to pre-train a ResNet50 (Residual Neural Network with 50 layers) backbone architecture on more than 100K unlabeled images. In the second stage, we add additional layers to ResNet50 to create a Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, and fine-tune it for object detection using a limited amount of labeled data (<13K images with 2.6K annotations).We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our methodology for images collected in canals and waterways of the Netherlands and South East Asia. We conduct a thorough comparison with the conventional SL method using the same Faster R-CNN architecture and ImageNet pre-trained weights. The results suggest that our method improves both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization performances over the SL method. Our findings also demonstrate that feature representations learned by the SwAV pre-training on context-related images outperform those learned from much larger, but unrelated, datasets (e.g., ImageNet).Based on these results, we suggest stakeholders (e.g., researchers, consultants and governmental organizations) to consider SSL methods to develop more robust systems for targeted long-term floating macroplastics monitoring. Future work should focus on scaling up computations by resorting to much larger (e.g., over 1 million images), yet relatively inexpensive, unlabeled datasets to fully exploit SSL.",

Based on the learning technique, supervised learning can be distinguished using a dataset (training data) that is already labeled, while unsupervised learning draws conclusions based on the dataset. The input in the form of a dataset is used by machine learning to produce the correct analysis. The problem to be solved by iris flowers (iris tectorum), which has flowers of various colors and has sepals and petals that indicate the species of flowers, requires an appropriate method for grouping these flowers into iris-setosa, iris-versicolor or iris-virginica species.

        "abstract": "In traditional machine learning environments, the use of non-parametric error estimation to set the discriminative threshold of a classifier to achieve the best accuracy is very effective. This method is not effective in a transfer learning environment because it is only reliable when both the training and testing data have similar distributions which is not the case in a transfer learning setting. Although the use of control variate techniques has been proposed to exploit the information about the error in the training sample to reduce the error in the test sample, this method yields a finite variance and the model uncertainty is not distributed among the variance. In this paper, we proposed and test a new transfer learning validation method called control linear minimum mean-squared error (CLMMSE) for source model selection under homogeneous transfer learning settings with the absence of an adequate pre-trained source model. Our approach adopts the Bayesian linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) and integrates the idea of importance sampling into a control variate approach to provide an accurate estimate for the LMMSE that is then used to select the optimal source model. By combining importance sampling with the control variate technique to reduce further the variance, we can achieve a much tighter bound with the LMMSE. This approach reduces the risk in the target domain under data shift. Experimental results on synthetic data under two data shift settings demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A further experiment on two real-world datasets shows that we were able to improve the accuracy of two state-of-the-art models tested; Bert (0.94\\% to 65\\%) and CodeBERT (1.82\\% to 18.2\\%) when compared to using previous selection methods.",

        "abstract": "Textbook Question Answering (TQA) is the task of answering diagram and non-diagram questions given large multi-modal contexts consisting of abundant text and diagrams. Deep text understandings and effective learning of diagram semantics are important for this task due to its specificity. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised learning method for TQA (WSTQ), which regards the incompletely accurate results of essential intermediate procedures for this task as supervision to develop Text Matching (TM) and Relation Detection (RD) tasks and then employs the tasks to motivate itself to learn strong text comprehension and excellent diagram semantics respectively. Specifically, we apply the result of text retrieval to build positive as well as negative text pairs. In order to learn deep text understandings, we first pre-train the text understanding module of WSTQ on TM and then fine-tune it on TQA. We build positive as well as negative relation pairs by checking whether there is any overlap between the items/regions detected from diagrams using object detection. The RD task forces our method to learn the relationships between regions, which are crucial to express the diagram semantics. We train WSTQ on RD and TQA simultaneously, \\emph{i.e.}, multitask learning, to obtain effective diagram semantics and then improve the TQA performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on CK12-QA and AI2D to verify the effectiveness of WSTQ. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements of $5.02\\%$ and $4.12\\%$ on test splits of the above datasets respectively than the current state-of-the-art baseline.

Among these, cardiovascular complications pose a significant threat, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates. Health screening plays a pivotal role in stratifying the risk levels of diabetes patients, facilitating proactive measures to prevent the progression of complications. As such, the primary objective of this study is to develop a predictive model system for assessing cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients. Our study used the Cardiovascular Disease dataset and conducts experiments with various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The results reveal that ensemble learning algorithms based on boosting, particularly AdaBoost and XGBoost, outperform other supervised machine learning methods. However, even with the best performance achieved using the dataset, the accuracy stands at 0.71, and the F-1 score is 0.69, which is still acceptable for screening purposes. Although these results provide valuable insights, indicating individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes, further improvements are needed to enhance early prevention strategies.</p>",

        "abstract": "Fractional calculus gained a lot of attention in the last couple of years. Researchers discovered that processes in various fields follow rather fractional dynamics than ordinary integer-ordered dynamics, meaning the corresponding differential equations feature non-integer valued derivatives. There are several arguments for why this is the case, one of them being that fractional derivatives’ inherit spatiotemporal memory and/or the ability to express complex naturally occurring phenomena. Another popular topic nowadays is machine learning, i.e., learning behavior and patterns from historical data. In our ever-changing world with ever-increasing amounts of data, machine learning is a powerful tool for data analysis, problem-solving, modeling, and prediction. It further provides many insights and discoveries in various scientific disciplines. As these two modern-day topics provide a lot of potential for combined approaches to describe complex dynamics, this article reviews combined approaches of fractional derivatives and machine learning from the past, puts them into context, and thus provides a list of possible combined approaches and the corresponding techniques. Note, however, that this article does not deal with neural networks, as there already is profound literature on neural networks and fractional calculus. We sorted past combined approaches from the literature into three categories, i.e., preprocessing, machine learning &amp;amp; fractional dynamics, and optimization. The contributions of fractional derivatives to machine learning are manifold as they provide powerful preprocessing and feature augmentation techniques, can improve physically informed machine learning, and are capable of improving hyperparameter optimization. Thus, this article serves to motivate researchers dealing with data-based problems, to be specific machine learning practitioners, to adopt new tools and enhance their existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDocument Layout Analysis (DLA) is the process of automatically identifying and categorizing the structural components (e.g. Text, Figure, Table, etc.) within a document to extract meaningful content and establish the page's layout structure. It is a crucial stage in document parsing, contributing to their comprehension. However, traditional DLA approaches often demand a significant volume of labeled training data, and the labor-intensive task of generating high-quality annotated training data poses a substantial challenge. In order to address this challenge, we proposed a semi-supervised setting that aims to perform learning on limited annotated categories by eliminating exhaustive and expensive mask annotations. The proposed setting is expected to be generalizable to novel categories as it learns the underlying positional information through a support set and class information through Co-Occurrence that can be generalized from annotated categories to novel categories. Here, we first extract features from the input image and support set with a shared multi-scale feature acquisition backbone. Then, the extracted feature representation is fed to the transformer encoder as a query. Later on, we utilize a semantic embedding network before the decoder to capture the underlying semantic relationships and similarities between different instances, enabling the model to make accurate predictions or classifications with only a limited amount of labeled data. Extensive experimentation on competitive benchmarks like PRIMA, DocLayNet, and Historical Japanese (HJ) demonstrate that this generalized setup obtains significant performance compared to the conventional supervised approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn an effort to identify cyber-attacks on infill structures, detection systems based on supervised learning have been attempted in Additive Manufacturing (AM) security investigations. However, supervised learning requires a myriad of training data sets to achieve acceptable detection accuracy. Besides, since it is impossible to train for unprecedented defective types, the detection systems cannot guarantee robustness against unforeseen attacks.\nTo overcome such disadvantages of supervised learning, This paper presents infill defective detection system (IDDS) augmented by semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning allows classifying a sheer volume of unlabeled data sets by training a comparably small number of labeled data sets. Additionally, IDDS exploits self-training to increase the robustness against various defective types that are not pre-trained.\nIDDS consists of the feature extraction, pre-training, self-training. To validate the usefulness of IDDS, five defective types were designed and tested with IDDS, which was trained by only normal labeled data sets. The results are compared with the basis accuracy from the perceptron network model with supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Textbook Question Answering (TQA) is the task of answering diagram and non-diagram questions given large multi-modal contexts consisting of abundant text and diagrams. Deep text understandings and effective learning of diagram semantics are important for this task due to its specificity. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised learning method for TQA (WSTQ), which regards the incompletely accurate results of essential intermediate procedures for this task as supervision to develop Text Matching (TM) and Relation Detection (RD) tasks and then employs the tasks to motivate itself to learn strong text comprehension and excellent diagram semantics respectively. Specifically, we apply the result of text retrieval to build positive as well as negative text pairs. In order to learn deep text understandings, we first pre-train the text understanding module of WSTQ on TM and then fine-tune it on TQA. We build positive as well as negative relation pairs by checking whether there is any overlap between the items/regions detected from diagrams using object detection. The RD task forces our method to learn the relationships between regions, which are crucial to express the diagram semantics. We train WSTQ on RD and TQA simultaneously, \\emph{i.e.}, multitask learning, to obtain effective diagram semantics and then improve the TQA performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on CK12-QA and AI2D to verify the effectiveness of WSTQ. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements of $5.02\\%$ and $4.12\\%$ on test splits of the above datasets respectively than the current state-of-the-art baseline. We have released our code on \\url{https://github.com/dr-majie/WSTQ}.",

        "abstract": "<p>Diabetes mellitus, particularly type-2 diabetes, remains a prevalent health issue, raising concerns due to its associated risk of complications. Among these, cardiovascular complications pose a significant threat, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates. Health screening plays a pivotal role in stratifying the risk levels of diabetes patients, facilitating proactive measures to prevent the progression of complications. As such, the primary objective of this study is to develop a predictive model system for assessing cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients. Our study used the Cardiovascular Disease dataset and conducts experiments with various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The results reveal that ensemble learning algorithms based on boosting, particularly AdaBoost and XGBoost, outperform other supervised machine learning methods. However, even with the best performance achieved using the dataset, the accuracy stands at 0.71, and the F-1 score is 0.69, which is still acceptable for screening purposes. Although these results provide valuable insights, indicating individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes, further improvements are needed to enhance early prevention strategies.</p>",

        "abstract": "In this paper, research was conducted on anomaly detection of wheel flats. In the railway sector, conducting tests with actual railway vehicles is challenging due to safety concerns for passengers and maintenance issues as it is a public industry. Therefore, dynamics software was utilized. Next, STFT (short-time Fourier transform) was performed to create spectrogram images. In the case of railway vehicles, control, monitoring, and communication are performed through TCMS, but complex analysis and data processing are difficult because there are no devices such as GPUs. Furthermore, there are memory limitations. Therefore, in this paper, the relatively lightweight models LeNet-5, ResNet-20, and MobileNet-V3 were selected for deep learning experiments. At this time, the LeNet-5 and MobileNet-V3 models were modified from the basic architecture. Since railway vehicles are given preventive maintenance, it is difficult to obtain fault data. Therefore, semi-supervised learning was also performed. At this time, the Deep One Class Classification paper was referenced. The evaluation results indicated that the modified LeNet-5 and MobileNet-V3 models achieved approximately 97% and 96% accuracy, respectively. At this point, the LeNet-5 model showed a training time of 12 min faster than the MobileNet-V3 model. In addition, the semi-supervised learning results showed a significant outcome of approximately 94% accuracy when considering the railway maintenance environment. In conclusion, considering the railway vehicle maintenance environment and device specifications, it was inferred that the relatively simple and lightweight LeNet-5 model can be effectively utilized while using small images.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSeismic wavelet extraction is a fundamental but crucial component in seismic data analysis, which aims at estimating the source wavelet for better decoding the subsurface reflectivities from seismic signals and calibrating the measurements between logging and seismic. Due to the rock heterogeneity, however, seismic energy attenuates during its propagation, and correspondingly the seismic wavelet is considered varying from shallow to deep as well as from near to far offsets, causing the wavelet time-variant. While machine learning (ML) appears feasible for assisting the challenge, without a comprehensive understanding of the seismic propagation, representative training labels cannot be prepared, and supervised learning appears less applicable. This study proposes implementing self-supervised learning into time-variant seismic wavelet extraction. Specifically, the proposed network is in the architecture of a dual-task auto-encoder (DTAE). Starting from 1-D seismic amplitude, the DTAE first uses an encoder to extract a set of features at multiple scales, which are then split into two flows, with one through a decoder that aims at reconstructing the input 1D seismic signal and the other through a few convolutional layers that aim at matching the spectrum between seismic trace and extracted wavelet. Correspondingly, the objective function of training such DTAE consists of two parts, the mean-square-error of the amplitude reconstruction and the mean-square-error of the spectrum matching. The proposed workflow is tested on various field datasets, and compared to the statistical wavelets, the extracted wavelets are of better match with the spectrum variation of seismic from shallow to deep and from near offset to far offset.",

This paper proposes a lightweight in-vehicle alcohol detection that processes the data generated from 6-alcohol sensors (MQ-3 Alcohol Sensors) using an optimizable shallow neural network (O-SNN). The experimental evaluation results exhibit a high-performance detection system scoring a 99.8% of detection accuracy with a very short inferencing delay of 2.22 µ seconds. Hence, the proposed model can be efficiently deployed and used to discover in-vehicle alcohol with high accuracy and low inference overhead as a part of the driver alcohol detection system for safety (DADSS) system aiming at massive deployment of alcohol sensing systems that could potentially save thousands of lives annually.",

        "abstract": "<p>Diabetes mellitus, particularly type-2 diabetes, remains a prevalent health issue, raising concerns due to its associated risk of complications. Among these, cardiovascular complications pose a significant threat, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates. Health screening plays a pivotal role in stratifying the risk levels of diabetes patients, facilitating proactive measures to prevent the progression of complications. As such, the primary objective of this study is to develop a predictive model system for assessing cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients. Our study used the Cardiovascular Disease dataset and conducts experiments with various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The results reveal that ensemble learning algorithms based on boosting, particularly AdaBoost and XGBoost, outperform other supervised machine learning methods. However, even with the best performance achieved using the dataset, the accuracy stands at 0.71, and the F-1 score is 0.69, which is still acceptable for screening purposes. Although these results provide valuable insights, indicating individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes, further improvements are needed to enhance early prevention strategies.</p>",

        "abstract": "Sentiment classification is an instrument of natural language processing tasks in text analysis to measure customer feedback from given documents such as product reviews, news, and texts. This research aims to experiment with Thai financial news sentiment classification and evaluate sentiment classification performance. In this research, we show financial news sentiment classification experimental results when comparing supervised and semi-supervised methods. In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency–inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language. From this study, we observe the importance of sentiment classification tools between supervised and semi-supervised learning, and we look forward to furthering this work.",

Bayesian reasoning, of which the naive Bayes classifier is an example, is based on the Bayes rule, which relates probabilities that are conditional and marginal. The strategy that we utilized in this project was to implement such a Naive Bayes Algorithm to classify based on a decision attribute that is produced by mining the answer dataset from numerous participants and assigning a class based on this procedure.

        "abstract": "AbstractInvestigators have recently introduced powerful methods for population genetic inference that rely on supervised machine learning from simulated data. Despite their performance advantages, these methods can fail when the simulated training data does not adequately resemble data from the real world. Here, we show that this “simulation mis-specification” problem can be framed as a “domain adaptation” problem, where a model learned from one data distribution is applied to a dataset drawn from a different distribution. By applying an established domain-adaptation technique based on a gradient reversal layer (GRL), originally introduced for image classification, we show that the effects of simulation mis-specification can be substantially mitigated. We focus our analysis on two state-of-the-art deep-learning population genetic methods—SIA, which infers positive selection from features of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), and ReLERNN, which infers recombination rates from genotype matrices. In the case of SIA, the domain adaptive framework also compensates for ARG inference error. Using thedomain-adaptive SIA (dadaSIA) model, we estimate improved selection coefficients at selected loci in the 1000 Genomes CEU population. We anticipate that domain adaptation will prove to be widely applicable in the growing use of supervised machine learning in population genetics.Author SummaryPopulation genetic simulation is a powerful tool in the study of evolution. A number of supervised machine learning methods have been developed that take advantage of inexpensive simulations as training data. Despite their outstanding performance in benchmarks, these models can fail when the simulated training data deviate from the real data. In this work, we employed domain adaptation techniques to address this “simulation mis-specification” problem by training the machine learning model jointly with simulated and real data. We performed extensive benchmark experiments to demonstrate the improvement of the domain-adaptive models over standard machine learning models in the presence of different types of mis-specification. In addition, we applieddadaSIA, a domain-adaptive selection inference model, to improve the estimates of selection coefficients at selected loci in a European population. The domain adaptation framework proposed in our work is widely applicable to models relying on synthetic training data and therefore opens the door to many more applications in population genetics.",

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning based sonar image object segmentation network (SISN). We use Mask RCNN as the base network and design a side flap noise generation module to make the model more robust to noise. In order to reduce the labeling of training samples, we introduce the concept of semi-supervised learning during the training process. We train the teacher model using a small amount of labeled data, thus generating pseudo-labels for the unlabeled samples. This is then supplemented with new data augmentation to improve the model’s resistance to sample perturbation and the prediction confidence of the pseudo-labeled data, thus optimizing the entire SISN training process. We conducted exhaustive experiments on the collected dataset, and the experimental results show that we can achieve high localization accuracy using less data for training, and show strong noise robustness on noisy samples.",

        "abstract": "The noise robustness of voice activity detection (VAD) tasks, which are used to identify the human speech portions of a continuous audio signal, is important for subsequent downstream applications such as keyword spotting and automatic speech recognition. Although various aspects of VAD have been recently studied by researchers, a proper training strategy for VAD has not received sufficient attention. Thus, a training strategy for VAD using supervised contrastive learning is proposed for the first time in this paper. The proposed method is used in conjunction with audio-specific data augmentation methods. The proposed supervised contrastive learning-based VAD (SCLVAD) method is trained using two common speech datasets and then evaluated using a third dataset. The experimental results show that the SCLVAD method is particularly effective in improving VAD performance in noisy environments. For clean environments, data augmentation improves VAD accuracy by 8.0 to 8.6%, but there is no improvement due to the use of supervised contrastive learning. On the other hand, for noisy environments, the SCLVAD method results in VAD accuracy improvements of 2.9% and 4.6% for “speech with noise” and “speech with music”, respectively, with only a negligible increase in processing overhead during training.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSeismic wavelet extraction is a fundamental but crucial component in seismic data analysis, which aims at estimating the source wavelet for better decoding the subsurface reflectivities from seismic signals and calibrating the measurements between logging and seismic. Due to the rock heterogeneity, however, seismic energy attenuates during its propagation, and correspondingly the seismic wavelet is considered varying from shallow to deep as well as from near to far offsets, causing the wavelet time-variant. While machine learning (ML) appears feasible for assisting the challenge, without a comprehensive understanding of the seismic propagation, representative training labels cannot be prepared, and supervised learning appears less applicable. This study proposes implementing self-supervised learning into time-variant seismic wavelet extraction. Specifically, the proposed network is in the architecture of a dual-task auto-encoder (DTAE). Starting from 1-D seismic amplitude, the DTAE first uses an encoder to extract a set of features at multiple scales, which are then split into two flows, with one through a decoder that aims at reconstructing the input 1D seismic signal and the other through a few convolutional layers that aim at matching the spectrum between seismic trace and extracted wavelet. Correspondingly, the objective function of training such DTAE consists of two parts, the mean-square-error of the amplitude reconstruction and the mean-square-error of the spectrum matching. The proposed workflow is tested on various field datasets, and compared to the statistical wavelets, the extracted wavelets are of better match with the spectrum variation of seismic from shallow to deep and from near offset to far offset.",

Preventing highly intoxicated persons from driving would potentially save many lives. This paper proposes a lightweight in-vehicle alcohol detection that processes the data generated from 6-alcohol sensors (MQ-3 Alcohol Sensors) using an optimizable shallow neural network (O-SNN). The experimental evaluation results exhibit a high-performance detection system scoring a 99.8% of detection accuracy with a very short inferencing delay of 2.22 µ seconds. Hence, the proposed model can be efficiently deployed and used to discover in-vehicle alcohol with high accuracy and low inference overhead as a part of the driver alcohol detection system for safety (DADSS) system aiming at massive deployment of alcohol sensing systems that could potentially save thousands of lives annually.",

        "abstract": "<p>Diabetes mellitus, particularly type-2 diabetes, remains a prevalent health issue, raising concerns due to its associated risk of complications. Among these, cardiovascular complications pose a significant threat, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates. Health screening plays a pivotal role in stratifying the risk levels of diabetes patients, facilitating proactive measures to prevent the progression of complications. As such, the primary objective of this study is to develop a predictive model system for assessing cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients. Our study used the Cardiovascular Disease dataset and conducts experiments with various supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The results reveal that ensemble learning algorithms based on boosting, particularly AdaBoost and XGBoost, outperform other supervised machine learning methods. However, even with the best performance achieved using the dataset, the accuracy stands at 0.71, and the F-1 score is 0.69, which is still acceptable for screening purposes. Although these results provide valuable insights, indicating individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular complications in diabetes, further improvements are needed to enhance early prevention strategies.</p>",

CGM devices are also highly visible and can thus act as a discomforting disease-marker for diabetes patients. To mitigate these issues, we develop and test a novel method that is able to predict blood glucose levels with only non-invasive predictor variables and a very small number of target variable measurements by using individualization and self-supervised deep learning. Using only a single blood glucose measurements per week, our method (6387.47 glucose-specific MSE) outperforms traditional deep learning performed with hourly measurements (8191.23 glucose-specific MSE). Across eight experiments where blood glucose measurements are more than one hour apart, our approach outperforms traditional deep learning without exception. Our findings suggest that self-supervised, individualized deep learning could provide an avenue towards alternatives to CGM devices that would be less costly, non-invasive, and thus more accessible.",

        "abstract": "Researchers are increasingly utilizing Deep Learning methods for computer vision to identify and quantify floating macroplastic litter. While these methods can provide precise assessments of plastic pollution by automatically processing images and videos, they often rely on the availability of large amount of annotated data for supervised learning (SL). Moreover, the manual labeling work is expensive and time-consuming. This hinders obtaining high model generalization capability, which is essential for the development of robust computer vision systems for structural monitoring.To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for detecting floating macroplastic litter based on the SwAV (Swapping Assignments between multiple Views of the same image) approach. SwAV is a self-supervised learning method that extracts the feature representations of data (such as images with macroplastic litter) without manual annotations. In the first stage of the SSL method, we use SwAV to pre-train a ResNet50 (Residual Neural Network with 50 layers) backbone architecture on more than 100K unlabeled images. In the second stage, we add additional layers to ResNet50 to create a Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture, and fine-tune it for object detection using a limited amount of labeled data (<13K images with 2.6K annotations).We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our methodology for images collected in canals and waterways of the Netherlands and South East Asia. We conduct a thorough comparison with the conventional SL method using the same Faster R-CNN architecture and ImageNet pre-trained weights. The results suggest that our method improves both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization performances over the SL method. Our findings also demonstrate that feature representations learned by the SwAV pre-training on context-related images outperform those learned from much larger, but unrelated, datasets (e.g., ImageNet).Based on these results, we suggest stakeholders (e.g., researchers, consultants and governmental organizations) to consider SSL methods to develop more robust systems for targeted long-term floating macroplastics monitoring. Future work should focus on scaling up computations by resorting to much larger (e.g., over 1 million images), yet relatively inexpensive, unlabeled datasets to fully exploit SSL.",

        "abstract": "The total boll count from a plant is one of the most important phenotypic traits for cotton breeding and is also an important factor for growers to estimate the final yield. With the recent advances in deep learning, many supervised learning approaches have been implemented to perform phenotypic trait measurement from images for various crops, but few studies have been conducted to count cotton bolls from field images. Supervised learning models require a vast number of annotated images for training, which has become a bottleneck for machine learning model development. The goal of this study is to develop both fully supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models to segment and count cotton bolls from proximal imagery. A total of 290 RGB images of cotton plants from both potted (indoor and outdoor) and in-field settings were taken by consumer-grade cameras and the raw images were divided into 4350 image tiles for further model training and testing. Two supervised models (Mask R-CNN and S-Count) and two weakly supervised approaches (WS-Count and CountSeg) were compared in terms of boll count accuracy and annotation costs. The results revealed that the weakly supervised counting approaches performed well with RMSE values of 1.826 and 1.284 for WS-Count and CountSeg, respectively, whereas the fully supervised models achieve RMSE values of 1.181 and 1.175 for S-Count and Mask R-CNN, respectively, when the number of bolls in an image patch is less than 10. In terms of data annotation costs, the weakly supervised approaches were at least 10 times more cost efficient than the supervised approach for boll counting. In the future, the deep learning models developed in this study can be extended to other plant organs, such as main stalks, nodes, and primary and secondary branches. Both the supervised and weakly supervised deep learning models for boll counting with low-cost RGB images can be used by cotton breeders, physiologists, and growers alike to improve crop breeding and yield estimation.",

Using pipeline supervised models to focus relevant structures, we achieve an accuracy of 94.4% for 15-view still-image echocardiographic view classification and 91.2% accuracy for binary left ventricular hypertrophy classification. We then develop semi-supervised generative adversarial network models that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data in a generalizable fashion. We achieve greater than 80% accuracy in view classification with only 4% of labeled data used in solely supervised techniques and achieve 92.3% accuracy for left ventricular hypertrophy classification. In exploring trade-offs between model type, resolution, data resources, and performance, we present a comprehensive analysis and improvements of efficient deep learning solutions for medical imaging assessment especially in cardiology.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised Learning (SSL) is a machine learning algorithm for pretraining Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) without requiring manually labeled data. The central idea of this learning technique is based on an auxiliary stage aka pretext task in which labeled data are created automatically through data augmentation and exploited for pretraining the DNN. However, the effect of each pretext task is not well studied or compared in the literature. In this paper, we study the contribution of augmentation operators on the performance of self supervised learning algorithms in a constrained settings. We propose an evolutionary search method for optimization of data augmentation pipeline in pretext tasks and measure the impact of augmentation operators in several SOTA SSL algorithms. By encoding different combination of augmentation operators in chromosomes we seek the optimal augmentation policies through an evolutionary optimization mechanism. We further introduce methods for analyzing and explaining the performance of optimized SSL algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed method can find solutions that outperform the accuracy of classification of SSL algorithms which confirms the influence of augmentation policy choice on the overall performance of SSL algorithms. We also compare optimal SSL solutions found by our evolutionary search mechanism and show the effect of batch size in the pretext task on two visual datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLower limbs exoskeleton robots improve the motor ability of humans and can facilitate superior rehabilitative training. By training large datasets, many of the currently available mobile and signal devices that may be worn on the body can employ machine learning approaches to forecast and classify people's movement characteristics. This approach could help exoskeleton robots improve their ability to predict human activities. Two popular data sets are PAMAP2, which was obtained by measuring people's movement through inertial sensors, and WISDM, which was collected people's activity information through mobile phones. With the focus on human activity recognition, this paper applied the traditional machine learning method and deep learning method to train and test these datasets, whereby it was found that the prediction performance of a decision tree model was highest on these two data sets, which is 99% and 72% separately, and the time consumption of decision tree is the least. In addition, a comparison of the signals collected from different parts of the human body showed that the signals deriving from the hands presented the best performance in terms of recognizing human movement types.",

        "abstract": "AbstractLearning with supervision has achieved remarkable success in numerous artificial intelligence (AI) applications. In the current literature, by referring to the properties of the labels prepared for the training dataset, learning with supervision is categorized as supervised learning (SL) and weakly supervised learning (WSL). SL concerns the situation where the training dataset is assigned with ideal (complete, exact and accurate) labels, while WSL concerns the situation where the training dataset is assigned with non-ideal (incomplete, inexact or inaccurate) labels. However, various solutions for SL tasks under the era of deep learning have shown that the given labels are not always easy to learn, and the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets can significantly affect the performance of the final SL solutions. Without considering the properties of the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets, the definition of SL conceals some details that can be critical to building the appropriate solutions for specific SL tasks. Thus, for practitioners in various AI application fields, it is desirable to reveal these details systematically. This article attempts to achieve this goal by expanding the categorization of SL and investigating the sub-type that plays the central role in SL. More specifically, taking into consideration the properties of the transformation from the given labels to easy-to-learn targets, we firstly categorize SL into three narrower sub-types. Then we focus on the moderately supervised learning (MSL) sub-type that concerns the situation where the given labels are ideal, but due to the simplicity in annotation, careful designs are required to transform the given labels into easy-to-learn targets. From the perspectives of the definition, framework and generality, we conceptualize MSL to present a complete fundamental basis to systematically analyse MSL tasks. At meantime, revealing the relation between the conceptualization of MSL and the mathematicians’ vision, this article as well establishes a tutorial for AI application practitioners to refer to viewing a problem to be solved from the mathematicians’ vision.",

        "abstract": "With the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) of cyber physical systems, intrusion detection systems are highly necessary to detect industrial network attacks. Recently, the increase in application of specialized machine learning techniques is gaining critical attention in the intrusion detection community. A wide variety of learning techniques proposed for different network intrusion detection system (NIDS) problems can be roughly classified into three broad categories: supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised. In this paper, a comparative study of selected learning methods from each of these three kinds is carried out. In order to assess these learning methods, they are subjected to investigate network traffic datasets from an Airplane Cabin Demonstrator. In addition to this, the imbalanced classes (normal and anomaly classes) that are present in the captured network traffic data is one of the most crucial issues to be taken into consideration. From this investigation, it has been identified that supervised learning methods (logistic and lasso logistic regression methods) perform better than other methods when historical data on former attacks are available. The performance of semi-supervised learning method (One class support vector machine) is comparatively better than supervised learning method (Isolation Forest) when historical data on former attacks are not available.",

The simplicity of preprocessing step and the outcome of the performance of SL and SSL were analyzed. Methods: Total 1625 Mn3s cropped images from 1000 panoramic images were labeled for classifications of the depth of impaction (D class), spatial relation with adjacent second molar (S class), and relationship with inferior alveolar nerve canal (N class). For the SL model, WideResNet (WRN) was applicated and for the SSL model, LaplaceNet (LN) was utilized. Results: In the WRN model, 300 labeled images for D and S classes, and 360 labeled images for N class were used for training and validation. In the LN model, only 40 labeled images for D, S, and N classes were used for learning. The F1 score were 0.87, 0.87, and 0.83 in WRN model, 0.84, 0.94, and 0.80 for D class, S class, and N class in the LN model, respectively. Conclusions: These results confirmed that the LN model applied as SSL, even utilizing a small number of labeled images, demonstrated the satisfactory of the prediction accuracy similar to that of the WRN model as SL.

        "abstract": "AbstractSemi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.",

For the non-operative diagnosis of breast carcinoma, core needle biopsy has been widely used in recent years which allows evaluation of both cytologic and tissue architectural features; so that it can provide a definitive diagnosis between IDC and benign lesion (e.g., fibroadenoma). Histopathological diagnosis based on core needle biopsy specimens is currently the cost effective method; therefore, it is an area that could benefit from AI-based tools to aid pathologists in their pathological diagnosis workflows. In this paper, we trained an Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification model using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning. We evaluated the model on a core needle biopsy (n=522) test set as well as three surgical test sets (n=1129) obtaining ROC AUCs in the range of 0.95-0.98.",

Dimensionality reduction is essential for downstream analysis, such as clustering to identify cell subpopulations. Usually, dimensionality reduction follows unsupervised approach. Results: In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method named scSemiAE, which is based on an autoencoder model. It transfers the information contained in available datasets with cell subpopulation labels to guide the search of better low-dimensional representations, which can ease further analysis. Conclusions: Experiments on five public datasets show that, scSemiAE outperforms both unsupervised and semi-supervised baselines whether the transferred information embodied in the number of labeled cells and labeled cell subpopulations is much or less.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nGenerally, a large amount of training data is essential to train deep learning model for obtaining more accurate detection performance in computer vision domain. However, to collect and annotate datasets will lead to extensive cost. In this letter, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task to learn general videos features without adding any human-annotated labels, aiming at improving the performance of violence recognition. Firstly, we propose a violence recognition method based on convolutional neural network with self-supervised auxiliary task, which can learn visual feature for improving down-stream task (recognizing violence). Secondly, we establish a balance-weighting scheme to solve the crucial problem of balancing the self-supervised auxiliary task and violence recognition task. Thirdly, we develop an attention receptive-field module, indicating that the proper use of the spatial attention mechanism can effectively expand the receptive fields of the module, further improving semantically meaningful representation of the network. To evaluate the proposed method, two benchmark datasets have been used, and better performance is shown by the experimental results comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.",

Due to its proximity to the equator, it experiences only a small angle of sunlight incidence. Its unique geographical location which can obtain sustainable and stable solar resources. This study takes research on the forecast of solar radiation to maximize the benefits of solar power generation, and develops methods that can predict the future solar radiation pattern to help reduce the costs of solar power generation. This study builds supervised machine learning models, known as deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). The hybrid supervised and unsupervised model, namely cluster-based artificial neural network (k-means clustering and fuzzy C-means clustering-based models), was developed. After establishing these models, the study evaluated their prediction results. For different prediction periods, the study selected the best-performing model based on the results and proposed combining them to establish a real-time updated solar radiation forecast system capable of predicting the next 12 hours. The study area covered Kaohsiung, Hualien, and Penghu in Taiwan. Data from ground stations of the Central Weather Administration, collected between 1993 and 2021, as well as the solar angle parameters of each station, were used as input data for the model. The results of this study show that different models have their advantages and disadvantages in predicting different future times. Therefore, the hybrid prediction system can predict future solar radiation more accurately than a single model.",

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (SML) is a powerful method for predicting a small number of well-defined output groups (e.g., potential buyers of a certain product) by taking as input a large number of known well-defined measurements (e.g., past purchases, income, ethnicity, gender, credit record, age, favorite color, favorite chewing gum). SML is predicated upon the existence of a training dataset in which the correspondence between the input and output is known to be true. SML has had enormous success in the world of commerce, and this success may have prompted a few scientists to employ it in the study of molecular and genome evolution. Here, we list the properties of SML that make it an unsuitable tool in certain evolutionary studies. In particular, we argue that SML cannot be used in an evolutionary exploratory context for the simple reason that training datasets that are known to be a priori true do not exist. As a case study, we use an SML study in which it was concluded that most human genomes evolve by positive selection through soft selective sweeps (Schrider and Kern 2017). We show that in the absence of legitimate training datasets, Schrider and Kern (2017) used (1) simulations that employ many manipulatable variables and (2) a system of cherry-picking data that would put to shame most modern evangelical exegeses of the Bible. These two factors, in addition to the lack of methodological detail and negative controls, lead us to conclude that all evolutionary inferences derived from so-called SML algorithms (e.g., S-HIC) should be taken with a huge shovel of salt.",

        "abstract": "Similarity-based search of sequence collections is a core task in bioinformatics, one dominated for most of the genomic era by exact and heuristic alignment-based algorithms. However, even efficient heuristics such as BLAST may not scale to the data sets now emerging, motivating a range of alignment-free alternatives exploiting the underlying lexical structure of each sequence.In this paper, we introduce SuperVec, a novel supervised approach to learning sequence embeddings. Our method extends earlier Representation Learning (RL) based methods to include jointly contextual and class-related information for each sequence during training. This ensures that related sequence fragments have proximal representations in the target space, better reflecting the structure of the domain.Such representations may be used for downstream machine learning tasks or employed directly. Here, we apply SuperVec embeddings to a sequence retrieval task, where the goal is to retrieve sequences with the same family label as a given query. The SuperVec approach is extended further through H-SuperVec, a tree-based hierarchical method which learns embeddings across a range of feature spaces based on the class labels and their exclusive and exhaustive subsets.Experiments show that supervised learning of embeddings based on sequence labels using SuperVec and H-SuperVec provides a substantial improvement in retrieval performance over existing (unsupervised) RL-based approaches. Further, the new methods are an order of magnitude faster than BLAST for the database retrieval task, supporting hybrid approaches in which SuperVec rapidly filters the collection so that only potentially relevant records remain, allowing slower, more accurate methods to be executed quickly over a far smaller dataset. Thus, we may achieve faster query processing and higher precision than before.Finally, for some problems, direct use of embeddings is already sufficient to yield high levels of precision and recall. Extending this work to encompass weaker homology is the subject of ongoing research.",

Due to the less available labeled corpus, most of the current researches are based on shallow networks, which cannot fully capture the complex semantic features in the text of Chinese EMRs.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn this study, a hybrid deep learning method based on semi-supervised learning is proposed to extract the entity relations from small-scale complex Chinese EMRs.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe semantic features of sentences are extracted by residual network (ResNet) and the long dependent information is captured by bidirectional GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). Then the attention mechanism is used to assign weights to the extracted features respectively, and the output of the two attention mechanisms is integrated for relation prediction. We adjusted the training process with manually annotated small-scale relational corpus and bootstrapping semi-supervised learning algorithm, and continuously expanded the datasets during the training process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe experimental results show that the best F1-score of the proposed method on the overall relation categories  reaches 89.78%, which is 13.07% higher than the baseline CNN model.

        "abstract": "AbstractThe diversity of biological and ecological characteristics of organisms, and the underlying genetic patterns and processes of speciation, makes the development of universally applicable genetic species delimitation methods challenging. Many approaches, like those incorporating the multispecies coalescent, sometimes delimit populations and overestimate species numbers. This issue is exacerbated in taxa with inherently high population structure due to low dispersal ability, and in cryptic species resulting from nonecological speciation. These taxa present a conundrum when delimiting species: analyses rely heavily, if not entirely, on genetic data which over split species, while other lines of evidence lump. We showcase this conundrum in the harvester Theromaster brunneus, a low dispersal taxon with a wide geographic distribution and high potential for cryptic species. Integrating morphology, mitochondrial, and sub-genomic (double-digest RADSeq and ultraconserved elements) data, we find high discordance across analyses and data types in the number of inferred species, with further evidence that multispecies coalescent approaches over split. We demonstrate the power of a supervised machine learning approach in effectively delimiting cryptic species by creating a “custom” training dataset derived from a well-studied lineage with similar biological characteristics as Theromaster. This novel approach uses known taxa with particular biological characteristics to inform unknown taxa with similar characteristics, and uses modern computational tools ideally suited for species delimitation while also considering the biology and natural history of organisms to make more biologically informed species delimitation decisions. In principle, this approach is universally applicable for species delimitation of any taxon with genetic data, particularly for cryptic species.",

Previous works maximize the similarity between two vectors to be the objective of contrastive learning, suffering from the high-dimensionality of the vectors. In addition, most previous works have adopted discrete data augmentation to obtain positive samples and directly employed contrastive framework of computer vision to perform contrastive training, which could hamper contrastive training because text data is discrete and sparse compared with image data. To address those issues, we propose a grouped contrastive learning framework, i.e., GCLSR, which divides the high-dimensional feature vector into several groups and respectively computes the groups’ contrastive losses to make use of more local information, eventually obtaining a more fine-grained sentence representation. In addition, in GCLSR, we design a new self-attention mechanism and a continuous as well as partial word vector augmentation (PWVA). For the discrete and sparse text data, the usage of self-attention could help model focus the informative words by measuring the importance of every word in a sentence. By using the PWVA, GCLSR can obtain high-quality positive samples used for contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GCLSR achieves an encouraging result on the challenging datasets of the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) task and transfer task.",

However, these attempts, referred to as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), lack the ability to efficiently process data with multiple channels and therefore are limited to relatively simple inputs. In this work, we present a variety of hardware-adaptable quantum circuit ansatzes for use as convolutional kernels, and demonstrate that the quantum neural networks we report outperform existing QCNNs on classification tasks involving multi-channel data. We envision that the ability of these implementations to effectively learn inter-channel information will allow quantum machine learning methods to operate with more complex data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractEvolutionary biologists, primarily anatomists and ontogenists, employ modern geometric morphometrics to quantitatively analyse physical forms (e.g., skull morphology) and explore relationships, variations, and differences between samples and taxa using landmark coordinates. The standard approach comprises two steps, Generalised Procrustes Analysis (GPA) followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA projects the superimposed data produced by GPA onto a set of uncorrelated variables, which can be visualised on scatterplots and used to draw phenetic, evolutionary, and ontogenetic conclusions. Recently, the use of PCA in genetic studies has been challenged. Due to PCA’s central role in morphometrics, we sought to evaluate the standard approach and claims based on PCA outcomes. To test PCA’s accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility using benchmark data of the crania of five papionin genera, we developed MORPHIX, a Python package containing the necessary tools for processing superimposed landmark data with classifier and outlier detection methods, which can be further visualised using various plots. We discuss the case ofHomo Nesher Ramla, an archaic human with a questionable taxonomy. We found that PCA outcomes are artefacts of the input data and are neither reliable, robust, nor reproducible as field members may assume and that supervised machine learning classifiers are more accurate both for classification and detecting new taxa. Our findings raise concerns about PCA-based findings in 18,000 to 32,900 studies. Our work can be used to evaluate prior and novel claims concerning the origins and relatedness of inter- and intra-species and improve phylogenetic and taxonomic reconstructions.",

        "abstract": "Both elastic and viscoplastic behaviors of the Earth&#8217;s upper mantle are highly anisotropic, because olivine, which composes 60-80% of the mantle, has a strong intrinsic anisotropy and develops strong crystal preferred orientations (CPO). Predicting the evolution of anisotropy with strain is essential to: (1) probe indirectly the deformation in the mantle based on seismic measurements and (2) accounting for the deformation history when simulating the long-term dynamics of the Earth. However, traditional micro-mechanical approaches to model the evolution of CPO-induced elastic and viscous anisotropies are too memory-costly and time-consuming for coupling into geodynamical simulations. To speed up the prediction of seismic anisotropy in the mantle, we developed deep-learning (DL) surrogates trained on a synthetic database built with viscoplastic self-consistent simulations of texture evolution of olivine polycrystals in typical 2D geodynamical flows. A first challenge was the choice of memory-saving representations of the CPO. Training the DL models on the evolution of the elastic tensor components avoided the need of storing the CPOs. However, the major challenge has been to prevent error compounding in a recursive-prediction scheme &#8211; where a model prediction at a given time step becomes the input for the next one - to evaluate the anisotropy evolution along a flow line. We implemented multilayer feed-forward (FFNN), ensemble, and transformer neural networks, obtaining the best efficiency/accuracy ratio for the FFNN. The results highlight the importance of (1) the standardization of the outputs in the training stage to avoid overfitting in predictions, (2) the statistical characteristics of the strain histories in the training database, and (3) the influence of non-monotonic strain histories on error propagation. Predictions for complex unseen strain histories are accurate, much more time-efficient and memory-costly than the traditional micro-mechanical models. Our work opens thus new avenues for modeling the strain-controlled evolution of mechanical anisotropy in the Earth&#8217;s mantle.

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh experiences extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall due to monsoon, tropical cyclones, and thunderstorms resulting in floods every year. Regular flood events significantly affect in agricultural industries and human lives for economic losses. One of the reasons for these weather phenomena to sustain is latent heat release from Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Southeast Tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO). As the country has limited observations from stations and oceans, modeling for numerical weather prediction (NWP) are challenging for local operations. For operational NWP, computational resources and time are also concerns for a developing country like Bangladesh. Besides, recent machine learning (ML) techniques are widely applied to study various meteorological events with efficient results. Therefore, this research aims to estimate predictability and accuracy of supervised ML for tropical cyclones by assessing air temperature at 2 meter (AT) and sea surface temperature (SST). For AT and SST, the study utilizes monthly data at 0.25 &amp;#215; 0.25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; horizontal resolution provided by the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5). The gridded data is downscaled to area of interests such as coastal regions, BoB and SEITO with a study period of 40 years from 1979 to 2018. Furthermore, Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) provides AT for 36 years from 1979 to 2015. The experiments segregate into two sections: (1) data normalizations via linear regression (LR) and multi-linear regression (MLR) and (2) supervised ML techniques applications in Matlab 2018b. The pre-processed data for LR show that AT from coastal regions such as Chittagong (CG), Barishal (BR), and Khulna (KL) divisions have stronger correlations (R) to SST in BOB with R = 0.910, 0.850, and 0.846 respectively than SEITO (R = 0.698, 0.675 and 0.678 respectively). Moreover, for these three regions, the correlation of MLR is 0.916 and 0.745 for BoB and SEITO with residual standard error (RSE) 1.312 and 1.218 respectively. For supervised ML applications, coarse decision tree (CDT) predict SST based on AT with train (80%) and test (20%) of the ERA5 data. Finally, the results from CDT model indicate that SST predictions are possible with 98.5% accuracy based on coastal stations. The trained CDT also validated model prediction utilizing observed AT (BMD observations) to forecast monthly SST and found 85% accuracy for monthly time series. In conclusions, CDT can predict SST from station data and assess if there is any possibility for tropical cyclone formation. The future works include further assessment for various categories of tropical cyclone and predict their intensity based on SSTs. This research aims to contribute in disaster mitigation by improving early warning systems. The possibility of cyclone formations will help for preparedness in saving property damages in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;",

Making decisions and engineering approaches grew from being trial- and-error, educated guesses, well-studied designs, to finally creating advanced and well developed models and simulations. Yet, the development of approaches has been and will always be rapidly ongoing. In order to stay competitive, the approaches must be constantly improving.\nThis study was performed as a proof-of-concept to assess and prove the practicality of using supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to predict multiphase flow regimes in horizontal pipes. The flow is comprised of air, water, and oil. The input features used were water cut (the percentage of water), gas superficial velocity, and liquid superficial velocity. The predicted output was one of six possible flow regimes. The algorithms assessed in the study were Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). According to the results, the best candidate for the dataset is to use the random forest algorithm with a high accuracy of 90.8% and low training time (0.13 seconds) in case of increasing the size of the data and features.\nAll the predictive algorithms can be easily improved in accuracy by increasing experience, either increasing the size of the dataset or addition of relevant features. The trained model and logic can be applied in industry by automating flow control or installing prediction and mitigation systems in pipelines and field operations.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe question of how neurons embedded in a network update their synaptic weights to collectively achieve behavioral goals is a longstanding problem in systems neuroscience. Since Hebb’s hypothesis [10] that cells that fire together strengthen their connections, cellular studies [6] have shed light on potential synaptic mechanisms underlying learning. These mechanisms have directly driven the careful hand design of biologically plausible models of learning and memory in computational neuroscience [1]. However, these hand designed rules have yet to achieve satisfying success training large neural networks, and are dramatically outperformed by biologically implausible approaches such as backprop. We propose an alternative paradigm for designing biologically plausible learning rules: using meta-learning tolearna parametric synaptic update rule which is capable of training deep networks. We demonstrate this approach by meta-learning an update rule for semi-supervised tasks, where sparse labels are provided to a deep network but the majority of inputs are unlabeled. The meta-learned plasticity rule integrates bottom-up, top-down, and recurrent inputs to each neuron, and generates weight updates as the product of pre- and post- synaptic neuronal outputs. The way in which the inputs to each neuron are combined to produce a learning signal, however, is itself ameta-learnedfunction, parameterized by a neural network. Critically, the meta-learned update rule integrates only neuron-local information when proposing updates–that is, our learning rule is spatially localized to individual neurons. After meta-learning, the resulting synaptic update rule is capable of driving task-relevant learning for semi-supervised tasks. We demonstrate this capability on two simple classification problems. In general, we believe meta-learning to be a powerful approach to finding more effective synaptic plasticity rules, which will motivate new hypotheses for biological neural networks, and new algorithms for artificial neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Traditional approaches to mapping rice areas depend on detailed field surveys to gather label data. This data gathering, while thorough, is often time-consuming, and costly. Further, for long-term rice area mapping, especially at large scales, ground validation can only be made in recent years, which may lead to uncertainties in rice areas of the past. To solve this limitation, this study introduces a novel method for classifying rice cultivation areas without the need for field data by employing a self-supervised learning framework within Google Earth Engine. Using MODIS data to calculate indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI), and the Land and Surface Water Index (LSWI), a pseudo-label boundary was delineated. The delineation of the boundary involved marking flooded regions, where LSWI + 0.05 &#8805; NDVI  EVI. Within these flooded regions, instances when EVI in the first 40 days was at least half of the peak EVI during the growing season were assigned as rice. In contrast, regions that did not meet these criteria were considered for non-rice. As proof of concept, the delineated pseudo-label boundaries of rice and non-rice were randomly sampled and trained on several machine learning models like random forests, support vector machines, gradient-boosted trees, and decision trees, to classify rice areas in Punjab, India, from 2003 to 2022. The random forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an Area Under the Curve of receiver-operating characteristics (AUC) of 0.71, compared to other models (AUC of ~0.55). Furthermore, comparing the self-supervised models against the same machine learning models, which were traditionally trained on field survey data (228 ground points: 164 rice, 64 non-rice was collected), the self-supervised models showed ~10% higher performance than their traditionally supervised counterparts. Therefore, this study demonstrates that using this self-supervised modeling framework reduces the need for field-based annotations, while still providing reasonably accurate rice area maps.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to improve the reconstruction and generation performance of a variational autoencoder (VAE) by injecting an adversarial learning. Instead of comparing the reconstructed with the original data to calculate the reconstruction loss, we use a consistency principle for deep features. The main contributions are threefold. Firstly, our approach perfectly combines the two models, i.e., GAN and VAE, and thus improves the generation and reconstruction performance of the VAE. Secondly, the VAE training is done in two steps, which allows to dissociate the constraints used for the construction of the latent space on the one hand, and those used for the training of the decoder. By using this two-step learning process, our method can be more widely used in applications other than image processing. While training the encoder, the label information is integrated to better structure the latent space in a supervised way. The third contribution is to use the trained encoder for the consistency principle for deep features extracted from the hidden layers. We present experimental results to show that our method gives better performance than the original VAE. The results demonstrate that the adversarial constraints allow the decoder to generate images that are more authentic and realistic than the conventional VAE.",

The motivation behind using self-supervised learning is that even though we wouldn't probably get the accuracy rates as if we choose a supervised learning, we still can achieve amazing results with relatively low amount of data. This way of training allows us to train a model on unlabeled data (or to use a pre-trained model, which is always more accessible. It’s goal in the first unsupervised phase is to learn some good representations from raw audio samples, which can be useful for speech recognition tasks, without using any label data. Then, the model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose. It means that our involvement really occurs in the last layers of the model. This kind of training proved to be very powerful. We present complete framework from model to practice with simulations and training model and present an impressive result on Hebrew.",

Among these, cardiovascular complications pose a\nsignificant threat, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates.\nHealth screening plays a pivotal role in stratifying the risk levels of\ndiabetes patients, facilitating proactive measures to prevent the\nprogression of complications. As such, the primary objective of this\nstudy is to develop a predictive model system for assessing\ncardiovascular risk in diabetes patients. Our study used the\nCardiovascular Disease dataset and conducts experiments with various\nsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, decision\ntree, random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The results reveal that\nensemble learning algorithms based on boosting, particularly AdaBoost\nand XGBoost, outperform other supervised machine learning methods.\nHowever, even with the best performance achieved using the dataset, the\naccuracy stands at 0.71, and the F-1 score is 0.69, which is still\nacceptable for screening purposes. Although these results provide\nvaluable insights, indicating individuals at higher risk for\ncardiovascular complications in diabetes, further improvements are\nneeded to enhance early prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMonitoring road conditions, e.g., water build-up due to intense rainfall, plays a fundamental role in ensuring road safety while increasing resilience to the effects of climate change. Distributed cameras provide an easy and affordable alternative to instrumented weather stations, enabling diffused and capillary road monitoring. Here, we propose a deep learning-based solution to automatically detect wet road events in continuous video streams acquired by road-side surveillance cameras. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we employ a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory model (convLSTM) to detect subtle changes in the road appearance, introducing a novel temporally consistent data augmentation to increase robustness to outdoor illumination conditions. Second, we present a contrastive self-supervised framework that is uniquely tailored to surveillance camera networks. The proposed technique was validated on a large-scale dataset comprising roughly 2000 full day sequences (roughly 400K video frames, of which 300K unlabelled), acquired from several road-side cameras over a span of two years. Experimental results show the effectiveness of self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, increasing the frame classification performance (measured by the Area under the ROC curve) from 0.86 to 0.92. From the standpoint of event detection, we show that incorporating temporal features through a convLSTM model both improves the detection rate of wet road events (+ 10%) and reduces false positive alarms ($$-$$\n-\n 45%). The proposed techniques could benefit also other tasks related to weather analysis from road-side and vehicle-mounted cameras.",

        "abstract": "The machine learning approach can help Geoscientists do their work in well log analysis to developing the oil and gas field. Prediction categorical or numerical response variable using a set of predictor variables supervises and semi-supervises learning is an important goal of the machine learning approach in classifying lithofacies using well log data. Semi-supervised classification offers the possibility of exploring the structure of the data without entirely external knowledge or guidance in the form of target or class information, and semi-supervised is very rarely research in the field of lithofacies classification.  Well log data in gamma-ray, resistivity, neutrality, and density logs are collected and selected for data processing and transformation. The use of machine learning algorithms such as Naí¯ve Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree is to find the log pattern or pattern classifications of lithofacies in supervised and semi-supervised to create a model with conditions requiring the change of data and the corresponding requirements. All supervised machine learning algorithms have the best accuracy because algorithms provide useful predictive in classifications based on the target but not if there are no targets given or semi-supervised. This paper compares some of the famous classification algorithms of machine learning, such as Decision tree, SVM, and Naí¯ve Bayes, on classifying lithofacies with supervised and semi-supervised learning. This research found that the semi-supervised learning of Naí¯ve Bayes has performed well in classified lithofacies. In contrast, in supervised learning, Decision Tree and SVM are superior in accuracy and visualization approach based on expert’s interpretation.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of traditional supervised learning (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) in the classification of mandibular third molars (Mn3s) on panoramic images. The simplicity of preprocessing step and the outcome of the performance of SL and SSL were analyzed. Methods: Total 1625 Mn3s cropped images from 1000 panoramic images were labeled for classifications of the depth of impaction (D class), spatial relation with adjacent second molar (S class), and relationship with inferior alveolar nerve canal (N class). For the SL model, WideResNet (WRN) was applicated and for the SSL model, LaplaceNet (LN) was utilized. Results: In the WRN model, 300 labeled images for D and S classes, and 360 labeled images for N class were used for training and validation. In the LN model, only 40 labeled images for D, S, and N classes were used for learning. The F1 score were 0.87, 0.87, and 0.83 in WRN model, 0.84, 0.94, and 0.80 for D class, S class, and N class in the LN model, respectively. Conclusions: These results confirmed that the LN model applied as SSL, even utilizing a small number of labeled images, demonstrated the satisfactory of the prediction accuracy similar to that of the WRN model as SL.

        "abstract": "AbstractSemi-supervised learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with using labelled as well as unlabelled data to perform certain learning tasks. Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.",

        "abstract": "AbstractInvasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. For the non-operative diagnosis of breast carcinoma, core needle biopsy has been widely used in recent years which allows evaluation of both cytologic and tissue architectural features; so that it can provide a definitive diagnosis between IDC and benign lesion (e.g., fibroadenoma). Histopathological diagnosis based on core needle biopsy specimens is currently the cost effective method; therefore, it is an area that could benefit from AI-based tools to aid pathologists in their pathological diagnosis workflows. In this paper, we trained an Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification model using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning. We evaluated the model on a core needle biopsy (n=522) test set as well as three surgical test sets (n=1129) obtaining ROC AUCs in the range of 0.95-0.98.",

Dimensionality reduction is essential for downstream analysis, such as clustering to identify cell subpopulations. Usually, dimensionality reduction follows unsupervised approach. Results: In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method named scSemiAE, which is based on an autoencoder model. It transfers the information contained in available datasets with cell subpopulation labels to guide the search of better low-dimensional representations, which can ease further analysis. Conclusions: Experiments on five public datasets show that, scSemiAE outperforms both unsupervised and semi-supervised baselines whether the transferred information embodied in the number of labeled cells and labeled cell subpopulations is much or less.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important sources of energy is the sun. Taiwan is located at north 22-25° latitude. Due to its proximity to the equator, it experiences only a small angle of sunlight incidence. Its unique geographical location which can obtain sustainable and stable solar resources. This study takes research on the forecast of solar radiation to maximize the benefits of solar power generation, and develops methods that can predict the future solar radiation pattern to help reduce the costs of solar power generation. This study builds supervised machine learning models, known as deep neural network (DNN) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). The hybrid supervised and unsupervised model, namely cluster-based artificial neural network (k-means clustering and fuzzy C-means clustering-based models), was developed. After establishing these models, the study evaluated their prediction results. For different prediction periods, the study selected the best-performing model based on the results and proposed combining them to establish a real-time updated solar radiation forecast system capable of predicting the next 12 hours. The study area covered Kaohsiung, Hualien, and Penghu in Taiwan. Data from ground stations of the Central Weather Administration, collected between 1993 and 2021, as well as the solar angle parameters of each station, were used as input data for the model. The results of this study show that different models have their advantages and disadvantages in predicting different future times. Therefore, the hybrid prediction system can predict future solar radiation more accurately than a single model.",

        "abstract": "Supervised machine learning (SML) is a powerful method for predicting a small number of well-defined output groups (e.g., potential buyers of a certain product) by taking as input a large number of known well-defined measurements (e.g., past purchases, income, ethnicity, gender, credit record, age, favorite color, favorite chewing gum). SML is predicated upon the existence of a training dataset in which the correspondence between the input and output is known to be true. SML has had enormous success in the world of commerce, and this success may have prompted a few scientists to employ it in the study of molecular and genome evolution. Here, we list the properties of SML that make it an unsuitable tool in certain evolutionary studies. In particular, we argue that SML cannot be used in an evolutionary exploratory context for the simple reason that training datasets that are known to be a priori true do not exist. As a case study, we use an SML study in which it was concluded that most human genomes evolve by positive selection through soft selective sweeps (Schrider and Kern 2017). We show that in the absence of legitimate training datasets, Schrider and Kern (2017) used (1) simulations that employ many manipulatable variables and (2) a system of cherry-picking data that would put to shame most modern evangelical exegeses of the Bible. These two factors, in addition to the lack of methodological detail and negative controls, lead us to conclude that all evolutionary inferences derived from so-called SML algorithms (e.g., S-HIC) should be taken with a huge shovel of salt.",

However, to collect and annotate datasets will lead to extensive cost. In this letter, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary task to learn general videos features without adding any human-annotated labels, aiming at improving the performance of violence recognition. Firstly, we propose a violence recognition method based on convolutional neural network with self-supervised auxiliary task, which can learn visual feature for improving down-stream task (recognizing violence). Secondly, we establish a balance-weighting scheme to solve the crucial problem of balancing the self-supervised auxiliary task and violence recognition task. Thirdly, we develop an attention receptive-field module, indicating that the proper use of the spatial attention mechanism can effectively expand the receptive fields of the module, further improving semantically meaningful representation of the network. To evaluate the proposed method, two benchmark datasets have been used, and better performance is shown by the experimental results comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAlthough the cerebellum is typically linked to supervised learning algorithms, it also exhibits extensive connections to reward processing. In this study, we investigated the cerebellum’s role in executing reinforcement learning algorithms, with a particular emphasis on essential reward-prediction errors. We employed the Q-learning model to accurately reproduce the licking responses of mice in a Go/No-go auditory-discrimination task. This method enabled the calculation of reinforcement learning variables, such as reward, predicted reward, and reward-prediction errors in each learning trial. By tensor component analysis of two-photon Ca2+imaging data, we found that climbing fiber inputs of the two distinct components, which were specifically activated during Go and No-go cues in the learning process, showed an inverse relationship with predictive reward-prediction errors. Given the hypothesis of bidirectional parallel-fiber Purkinje-cell synaptic plasticity, Purkinje cells in these components could develop specific motor commands for their respective auditory cues, guided by the predictive reward-prediction errors from their climbing fiber inputs. These results indicate a possible role of context-specific actors in modular reinforcement learning, integrating with cerebellar supervised learning capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nStatic pressure is one of the very important parameters for reservoir engineering, it gives us precious information about our reservoir, such as drive mechanisms, quantities of hydrocarbon in place, patterns, communication between wells, fluid behavior in the reservoir, as consequence, the measurement of this parameter must be conducted on periodical basis, to appropriately know the field and build a good model of reservoir.\nThe advantage of this study can complete other studies that concentrate only on the oil production rate forecasting like Data Driven Production Forecasting Using Machine Learning [1], Production Forecasting in Conventional Oil Reservoirs Using Deep Learning [2], Machine Learning Prediction Versus Decline Curve Prediction: A Niger Delta Case Study [3], Decline Curve Analysis for Production Forecasting Based on Machine Learning [4] ……, in addition of static pressure evolution of wells.\nFor instance, we can optimize through this study a number of conducted tests to measure static pressure which will minimize operating costs and the probability of accidents occurring the operations, also reduce the shutdown time of wells for completion purpose of such measurement, in addition to the possibility of using this model for other analogue wells that do not have enough pressure measurement, without the need for time and extensive study. Besides, multivariate polynomial regression machine learning algorithm has been developed in this study to predict the evolution of static pressure for existing oil wells.",

        "abstract": "Distinguishing small earthquakes from man-made blasts at construction sites, in quarries and in mines is a non-trivial task during automatic event analysis and thus typically requires manual revision. We have developed station-specific classification models capable of both accurately assigning source type to seismic events in Sweden and filtering out spurious events from an automatic event catalogue. Our method divides all three components of the seismic records for each event into four non-overlapping time windows, corresponding to P-phase, P-coda, S-phase and S-coda, and computes the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) amplitude in each window. This process is repeated for a total of twenty narrow frequency bands. The resulting array of amplitudes is passed as inputs to fully connected Artificial Neural Network classifiers which attempt to filter out spurious events before distinguishing between natural earthquakes, industrial blasts and mining-induced events. The distinction includes e.g. distinguishing mining blasts from mining induced events, shallow earthquakes from blasts and differentiating between different types of mining induced events. The classifiers are trained on labelled seismic records dating from 2010 to 2021. They are already in use at the Swedish National Seismic Network where they serve as an aid to the routine manual analysis and as a tool for directly assigning preliminary source type to events in an automatic event catalogue. Initial results are promising and suggest that the method can accurately distinguish between different types of seismic events registered in Sweden and filter out the majority of spurious events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderwater acoustic object recognition is becoming attractive given the critical information available. However, this comes at the expense of large-scale annotated data, which is expensive to collect and annotate. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach of SE_RseNet_Decoder to recognizing insufficient sample underwater acoustic targets. Given this goal, we introduce the SE_RseNet_Decoder network containing supervised and unsupervised modules. Firstly, we leverage the supervised module to recognize the labeled signals and reduce the dimensional feature extraction of unlabeled samples. Then, the unsupervised network is designed as an auxiliary network to optimize the supervised network, which uses low-dimensional features to restore high-dimensional features of unlabeled samples to enhance the classification ability of the supervised network. We especially introduce ReLU activation function to connect the supervised and unsupervised modules that can help find a balanced relationship between classification and regression tasks for recognizing underwater acoustic signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework showing that the proposed approach achieves the best recognition accuracy compared with the other approaches with few samples. Moreover, the experimental results can demonstrate the optimal combination of variables for the recognition effect of the proposed method under multiple variables.",

First, massive unlabeled samples are used to establish a weighted support vector data description model. Then, the most valuable samples are used to improve the performance of network intrusion by combining with active learning, which utilizes labeled samples and unlabeled samples to extend the weighted support data description model in a semi-supervised learning method. The experimental results show that the active learning can utilize minor labeled sample to reduce the cost of manual labeling work, which is more suitable for an actual network intrusion detection environment.",

In this research, plethora of machine learning paradigms (e.g. feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and supervised classification methods) were explored, evaluated, compared and analyzed to identify the optimal pathway for brain MR images (normal vs neoplastic) binary classification task. External validation dataset was used to test the generalizability of the optimal predictive models implemented. Relevant and informative features were selected to construct cross-validated decision tree and eventually simple rule set was built based on the decision tree. The experimental results show that almost all pattern recognition paradigms achieve high accuracy with careful selection of number of attributes. LDA+ELM with 55 features are the optimal pipelines which achieve perfect classification when training and test data are of same source; and achieving (accuracy=97.5%, AUC=0.989, sensitivity=95% and specificity=100%) under balanced test dataset; (accuracy=99.5%, AUC=0.988, sensitivity=95% and specificity=100%). Cross-validated decision tree model also shows comparable performance: accuracy=98.8%, AUC=99.1%, sensitivity=99.6% and specificity=98.2%. Three highly relevant and robust attributes are visualized and selected for construction of decision tree models and finally a rule sets are read directly off the decision tree.

        "abstract": "Continuous seismological datasets offer insights for the understanding of the dynamics of many geological structures (such as landslides, ice glaciers, and volcanoes) in relation to various forcings (meteorological, climatic, tectonic, anthropic) factors. Recently, the emergence of dense seismic station networks has provided opportunities to document these phenomena, but also introduced challenges for seismologists due to the vast amount of data generated, requiring more sophisticated and automated data analysis&#160; techniques. To tackle this challenge, supervised machine learning demonstrates promising performance; however, it necessitates the creation of training catalogs, a process that is both time-consuming and subject to biases, including pre-detection of events and subjectivity in labeling. To address these biases, manage large data volumes and discover hidden signals in the datasets, we introduce a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) approach for the unsupervised clustering of continuous seismic data. The method uses siamese deep neural networks to learn from the initial data. The SSL model works by increasing the similarity between pairs of images corresponding to several representations (seismic traces, spectrograms) of the seismic data. The images are positioned in a 512-dimensional space where possible similar events are grouped together. We then identify groups of events using clustering algorithms, either centroid-based or density-based.&#160;\nThe processing technique is applied to two dense arrays of continuous seismological datasets acquired at the Marie-sur-Tin&#233;e landslide and the Pas-de-Chauvet rock glacier, both located in the South French Alps. Both datasets include over a month of continuous data from more than 50 stations. The processing technique is then applied to the continuous data streams from either a single station or from the whole station network. The clustering products show a high number of distinct clusters that could potentially be considered as produced by different types of sources. This includes the anticipated main types of seismicity observed in these contexts: earthquakes, rockfalls, natural and anthropogenic noises as well as potentially yet unknown sources. Our SSL-based clustering approach streamlines the exploration of large datasets, allowing more time for detailed analysis of the mechanisms and processes active in these geological structures.",

In addition, most of deep learning algorithms cannot capture accurate salient features in cloud images which is useful to ground-based cloud classification. In this study, a weakly supervised ground-based cloud classification method (WS-GCCA) is proposed based on the global and local features extracted by a coarse-grained and a fine-grained deep networks. The performance of the WS-GCCA is validated with a ground-based cloud classification database comprising 11 cloud types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WS-GCCA achieves an accuracy of 98.58, which is significantly higher classification accuracy than 10 state-of-art supervised learning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe quality control of wood products is often only checked at the end of the production process so that countermeasures can only be taken with a time delay in the event of fluctuations in product quality. This often leads to unnecessary and cost-intensive rejects. Furthermore, since quality control often requires additional procedural steps to be performed by a skilled worker, testing is time-consuming and costly. While traditional machine learning (ML) methods based on supervised learning have been used in the field with some success, the limited availability of labeled data is the major hurdle for further improving model performance. In the present study, the potential of enhancing the performance of the ML methods random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) for quality classification by using semi-supervised learning (SSL) was investigated. Labelled and unlabeled data were provided by Swiss Wood Solutions AG, which produces densified wood for high-value wood products such as musical instruments. The developed approach includes labeling of the unlabeled data using SSL, training and 10k cross-validation of the ML algorithms RF and SVM, and determining the generalization ability using the hold-out test set. Based on the evaluation indices such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, false-positive-rate (FPR) and confusion matrices, it was shown that SSL could enhance the prediction performance of the quality classification of ML models compared to the conventional supervised learning method. Despite having a small data set, the work paves the way for future applications of semi-supervised ML for wood quality assessment.",

Here, we have integrated semi-supervised machine learning in the ANN-SoLo tool, an efficient spectral library search engine that is optimized for open modification searching to identify peptides with any type of post-translational modification. We show that machine learning rescoring boosts the number of spectra that can be identified for both standard searching and open searching, and we provide insights into relevant spectrum characteristics harnessed by the machine learning model.

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) can be challenging in computer vision since facial expressions tend to be different among individuals. Researchers have introduced many outstanding methodologies and approaches to achieve the best performance in classifying and identifying emotions based on images of facial expressions. Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), outperforming supervised learning with cross-entropy loss, has gained much attention due to its recent performance in computer vision. In this work, we extended traditional approaches to common cross entropy loss and made approaches of contrastive learning to tackle the issue. Specifically, the frameworks in this work focus on the performance of cross entropy loss and supervised contrastive loss on the FER-2013 dataset. The result showed that supervised contrastive loss substantially improved accuracy by about 2% to 6% for ResNet architectures.",

To this end, we propose a method to transform the unsupervised problem of outlier detection into a supervised problem. Benchmarking our approach against common outlier detection methods shows clear advantages of our method when many irrelevant features are present.

It significantly advances our understanding of cellular diversity and function. Despite its potential, the analysis of scRNA-seq data poses considerable challenges relate to multicollinearity, data imbalance, and batch effect. One of the pivotal tasks in single-cell data analysis is cell type annotation, which classifies cells into discrete types based on their gene expression profiles. In this work, we propose a novel modeling formalism for cell type annotation with a supervised contrastive learning method, named SCLSC (SupervisedContrastiveLearning forSingleCell). Different from the previous usage of contrastive learning in single cell data analysis, we employed the contrastive learning for instance-type pairs instead of instance-instance pairs. More specifically, in the cell type annotation task, the contrastive learning is applied to learn cell and cell type representation that render cells of the same type to be clustered in the new embedding space. Through this approach, the knowledge derived from annotated cells is transferred to the feature representation for scRNA-seq data. The whole training process becomes more efficient when conducting contrastive learning for cell and their types. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed SCLSC method consistently achieves superior accuracy in predicting cell types compared to four state-of-the-art methods. SCLSC also performs well in identifying cell types in different batch groups. The simplicity of our method allows for scalability, making it suitable for analyzing datasets with a large number of cells. In a real-world application of SCLSC to monitor the dynamics of immune cell subpopulations over time, SCLSC demonstrates a capability to discriminate cell subtypes of CD19+ B cells that were not present in the training dataset.",

While we do not know which experimental treatments produce cells that look alike, we do know that cells exposed to the same experimental treatment should generally look similar. Thus, we explore training CNNs using a weakly supervised approach that uses this information for feature learning. In addition, the training stage is regularized to control for unwanted variations using mixup or RNNs. We conduct experiments on two different datasets; the proposed approach yields single-cell embeddings that are more accurate than the widely adopted classical features, and are competitive with previously proposed transfer learning approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMotivation\nGenome-wide association studies have systematically identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex genetic diseases. However, the majority of those SNPs were found in non-coding genomic regions, preventing the understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. Predicting molecular processes based on the DNA sequence represents a promising approach to understand the role of those non-coding SNPs. Over the past years, deep learning was successfully applied to regulatory sequence prediction using supervised learning. Supervised learning required DNA sequences associated with functional data for training, whose amount is strongly limited by the finite size of the human genome. Conversely, the amount of mammalian DNA sequences is exponentially increasing due to ongoing large sequencing projects, but without functional data in most cases.\n\nResults\nTo alleviate the limitations of supervised learning, we propose a paradigm shift with semi-supervised learning, which does not only exploit labeled sequences (e.g. human genome with ChIP-seq experiment), but also unlabeled sequences available in much larger amounts (e.g. from other species without ChIP-seq experiment, such as chimpanzee). Our approach is flexible and can be plugged into any neural architecture including shallow and deep networks, and shows strong predictive performance improvements compared to supervised learning in most cases (up to $$70\\%$$\n\n70\n%\n\n).\n\nAvailability and implementation\nhttps://forgemia.inra.fr/raphael.mourad/deepgnn.\n",

From networks of protein-protein interactions, potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods, which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns. Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs, which is not always true, as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies. The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms. Here, we present Super.Complex, a distributed, supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks. We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily. Super.Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities. A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities, and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks. On a yeast protein-interaction network, Super.Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods. Application of Super.Complex to a human protein-interaction network with ~8k nodes and ~60k edges yields 1,028 protein complexes, with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes. Super.Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features. Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities.

Cell type classification, which aims at characterizing and labeling groups of cells according to their gene expression, is one of the most important steps for single-cell analysis. To facilitate the manual curation process, supervised learning methods have been used to automatically classify cells. Most of the existing supervised learning approaches only utilize annotated cells in the training step while ignoring the more abundant unannotated cells. In this paper, we proposed scPretrain, a multi-task self-supervised learning approach that jointly considers annotated and unannotated cells for cell type classification. scPretrain consists of a pre-training step and a fine-tuning step. In the pre-training step, scPretrain uses a multi-task learning framework to train a feature extraction encoder based on each dataset’s pseudo-labels, where only unannotated cells are used. In the fine-tuning step, scPretrain fine-tunes this feature extraction encoder using the limited annotated cells in a new dataset. We evaluated scPretrain on 60 diverse datasets from different technologies, species and organs, and obtained a significant improvement on both cell type classification and cell clustering. Moreover, the representations obtained by scPretrain in the pre-training step also enhanced the performance of conventional classifiers such as random forest, logistic regression and support vector machines. scPretrain is able to effectively utilize the massive amount of unlabelled data and be applied to annotating increasingly generated scRNA-seq datasets.Availabilityhttps://github.com/ruiyi-zhang/scPretrain\\",

Another is self supervised learning with mask. We using threshold masks to select samples for different operations, i.e., self-supervised learning and structure-preserved learning.

Notably, a number of studies demonstrated that neurofeedback-based regulation of fMRI activity in several emotion-related areas leads to modifications of emotional behavior along with changes of neural activity in local and distributed networks, in both healthy individuals and individuals with emotional disorders. However, the current understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying self-regulation of the emotional brain, as well as their relationship with other emotion regulation strategies, is still limited. In this study, we attempted to delineate neuroanatomical regions mediating real-time fMRI-based emotion regulation by exploring whole brain GM and WM features predictive of self-regulation of anterior insula (AI) activity, a neuromodulation procedure that can successfully support emotional brain regulation in healthy individuals and patients. To this aim, we employed a multivariate kernel ridge regression model to assess brain volumetric features, at regional and network level, predictive of real-time fMRI-based AI regulation. Our results showed that several GM regions including fronto-occipital and medial temporal areas and the basal ganglia as well as WM regions including the fronto-occipital fasciculus, tapetum and fornix significantly predicted learned AI regulation. Remarkably, we observed a substantial contribution of the cerebellum in relation to both the most effective regulation run and average neurofeedback performance. Overall, our findings highlighted specific neurostructural features contributing to individual differences of AI-guided emotion regulation. Notably, such neuroanatomical topography partially overlaps with the neurofunctional network associated with cognitive emotion regulation strategies, suggesting common neural mechanisms.",

This article compares both approaches.\nAn auditory listening experiment was performed to examine if various listener groups (naive listeners, parents, nurses/midwives and therapists) were able to distinguish auditorily between healthy and pathological cries as well as to differentiate various pathologies from each other.\nListeners were trained in hearing cries of healthy infants and cries of infants suffering from cleft-lip-and-palate, hearing impairment, laryngomalacia, asphyxia and brain damage. After training, a listening experiment was performed by allocating 18 infant cries to the cry groups.\nMultiple supervised-learning classifications models were calculated on the base of the cries’ acoustic properties. The accuracy of the models was compared to the accuracy of the human listeners.\nWith a Kappa value of 0.491, listeners allocated the cries to the healthy and the five pathological groups with moderate performance. With a sensitivity of 0.64 and a specificity of 0.89, listeners were able to identify that a cry is a pathological one with higher confidence than separating between the single pathologies. Generalized linear mixed models found no significant differences between the classification accuracy of the listener groups. Significant differences between the pathological cry types were found.\nSupervised-learning classification models performed significantly better than the human listeners in classifying infant cries. The models reached an overall Kappa value of up to 0.837.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning (ML) approaches have gained increasing attention in the structural engineering field to evaluate structural performance using structural health monitoring (SHM) data. Supervised ML approaches can accelerate the learning process by using labeled training datasets to map an input to output dataset. But, SHM data are not informative to drive a mapping function to determine the real-world performance of large-scale complex structures in particular for future events. To leverage a framework for evaluating the system-level structural performance, this study couples supervised ML approaches with an advanced finite element (FE) model considering pre- and post-event model validation and updating. A well-instrumented system experiencing multiple seismic events is employed as a case study to demonstrate the proposed framework. An FE model of the instrumented system is created and validated using pre-event SHM datasets. Numerical data obtained from the FE model are used for datasets to develop ML prediction models, which are then validated by a post-event SHM dataset. Eight popular ML algorithms are examined and compared to shed light on the effectiveness of the ML algorithms for the proposed framework. The case study results indicate that the Random Forests and Neural Network algorithms provide better estimation for the structural system. The results also imply the need of post-event updating for numerical models used in the case study.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Peatlands are recognized as important carbon sequestration centres. Through restoration projects of peatlands in which the water table is raised, they may become carbon neutral or possibly carbon negative. National restoration plans require a knowledge of peatland extent and spatial distribution across large geographic areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently the availability of large geo-spatial datasets has increased. These range from soil, quaternary, and geology maps to airborne geophysical and satellite remote sensing data. Combining such datasets may provide a means to spatially map peatland extents and boundaries traditionally mapped via in-situ measurements. However, such datasets, and the relationship between them, are often complex. Modern Machine Learning methods can play a role in combining and analysing such multi-variate data within the discipline of Digital Soil Mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current peatland maps are created using combination of optical satellite remote sensing and legacy soil/quaternary maps. Optical remote sensing cannot detect peatlands under landcover such as forest or grassland. Legacy maps are often created from sparse in-situ augur, borehole, or trial pit data. These types of measurements do not allow for accurate measurement of boundaries or intra-peat variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern airborne geophysical datasets offer a potential means to update national and local scale peatlands maps. Radiometrics, a geophysical method that measures radiation emitted from geological materials, is particularly suited to peatland studies. Peat is a mostly organic material and so is, generally, not a source of radiation. Peat is also very saturated and water acts to scatter the emitted gamma rays. These effects combined means that peatlands act as a blanket to any source of radiation from below and show as &amp;#8220;low&amp;#8221; radiometric signal in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aims to use Airborne Radiometric data combined with modern machine learning classification techniques to examine the current spatial distribution a peatland database in the west of Ireland. The Quaternary Geology database currently maps peatland extent where peat thickness is greater than 1m at the surface and was created using traditional mapping techniques. The methodology shows that a direct measurement, such as radiometric data, analysed in a supervised machine learning framework, provides more accurate and justifiable estimates of peatland extent in this region.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "AbstractGeographic patterns of human genetic variation provide important insights into human evolution and disease. A commonly used tool to detect geographic patterns from genetic data is principal components analysis (PCA) or the supervised linear discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). However, genetic features produced from both approaches could fail to correctly characterize population structure for complex scenarios involving admixture. In this study, we introduce Kernel Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (KLFDAPC), a supervised nonlinear approach for inferring individual geographic genetic structure that could rectify the limitations of these approaches by preserving the multimodal space of samples. We tested the power of KLFDAPC to infer population structure and to predict individual geographic origin using neural networks. Simulation results showed that KLFDAPC significantly improved the population separability compared with PCA and DAPC. The application to POPRES and CONVERGE datasets indicated that the first two reduced features of KLFDAPC correctly recapitulated the geography of individuals, and significantly improved the accuracy of predicting individual geographic origin when compared to PCA and DAPC. Therefore, KLFDAPC can be useful for geographic ancestry inference, design of genome scans and correction for spatial stratification in GWAS that link genes to adaptation or disease susceptibility.",

A data-driven machine learning approach based on Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was implemented for CH4 concentrations up to 100 ppm in He, to provide binary classification of samples above or below a threshold of 2 ppm. With a low-resolution spectrometer and a custom spectral alignment procedure, a prediction accuracy of 98% was achieved, demonstrating the power of machine learning with otherwise prohibitively complex spectral analysis.

It processes what a person eats and drinks and converts food into nutrients that need to be absorbed by the body.

When this organ is damaged, liver disease can develop. Liver disease refers to any condition that causes damage to the liver and may affect its function. It is a serious condition that threatens human life and requires urgent medical attention. Early prediction of the disease using machine learning (ML) techniques will be the point of interest in this study. Specifically, in the content of this research work, various ML models and Ensemble methods were evaluated and compared in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure and area under the curve (AUC) in order to predict liver disease occurrence.

We apply the principle of mutual information maximization between local and global information as a self-supervised pretraining signal for protein embeddings. To do so, we divide protein sequences into fixed size fragments, and train an autoregressive model to distinguish between subsequent fragments from the same protein and fragments from random proteins. Our model, CPCProt, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art self-supervised models for protein sequence embeddings on various downstream tasks, but reduces the number of parameters down to 2% to 10% of benchmarked models. Further, we explore how downstream assessment protocols affect embedding evaluation, and the effect of contrastive learning hyperparameters on empirical performance. We hope that these results will inform the development of contrastive learning methods in protein biology and other modalities.",

The algorithms of Machine learning used alone or combined with the SDN controller's northbound applications in order to make intelligent SDN. SDN is such potential networking design that blends network's programmability with central administration. The control and the data planes are separated in SDN, and the network with central management point is called SDN controller, which may be programmed and utilized as a brain of the network. Lately, the community of researchers have shown a greater willingness to take advantage of current advances in artificial intelligence to give the SDN best decision making and learning skills. Our research found that combining SDN with Intelligent Supervised Machine Learning (ISML) is very important for performance improvement. ISML is the development of algorithms that can generate broad patterns and assumptions from external source instances in order to portend the predestination of future instances. The ISML algorithms of classification goal is to categorize data based on past information. In data science problems, classification is used rather frequently. To solve such problems, a number of successful approaches were already presented, including rule-based techniques, instance-based techniques, logic-based techniques, and stochastic techniques.

A trait shared by the majority of these methods is that the class associated with each example is ascertained by examining the activations of the last fully connected layer, and the networks are trained to minimize the cross-entropy between predictions extracted from this layer and ground-truth annotations. In this work, we extend this paradigm by introducing an additional output branch which maps the inputs to low dimensional representations, effectively extracting additional feature representations of the inputs. The proposed model imposes additional distance constrains on these representations with respect to identified class representatives, in addition to the traditional categorical cross-entropy between predictions and ground-truth. By extending the typical cross-entropy loss function with a distance learning function, our proposed approach achieves significant gains across a wide set of benchmark datasets in terms of classification, while providing additional evidence related to class membership and classification confidence.",

In this paper, we address one of the main problems in the consumer price index calculation, namely the product classification, which cannot be performed manually when using large data sources. Therefore, we conducted an experiment on automatic product classification according to an international classification scheme. We combined 9 different word-embedding techniques with 13 classification methods with the aim of identifying the best combination in terms of the quality of the resultant classification. Because the dataset used in this experiment was significantly imbalanced, we compared these methods not only using the accuracy, F1-score, and AUC, but also using a weighted F1-score that better reflected the overall classification quality. Our experiment showed that logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, combined with the FastText skip-gram embedding technique provided the best classification results, with superior values in performance metrics, as compared to other similar studies. An execution time analysis showed that, among the three mentioned methods, logistic regression was the fastest while the random forest recorded a longer execution time. We also provided per-class performance metrics and formulated an error analysis that enabled us to identify methods that could be excluded from the range of choices because they provided less reliable classifications for our purposes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nA public ledger is used by Bitcoin, a digital currency, to keep track of transactions. The owner of the Bitcoin keeps their identity secret and is identified only by their unique address. This indicates that because Bitcoin offers anonymity, it may be utilized for illicit purposes on a regular basis. This study presents a supervised machine learning approach for predicting anonymous user activities on the Bitcoin Blockchain. As a training dataset to facilitate the user activities classification, we created a labelled dataset with over 4 million samples from exchanges, gambling, pools, and services whose identities and types were disclosed. The primary goal is to classify transactions on the blockchain in order to deanonymize them and distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate ones. On the class imbalanced dataset, we obtained impressive cross-validation (CV) accuracy using the Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting with default parameters and hyperparameters. Using Random Forest helped achieve the best cross-validation accuracy on default parameters and hyperparameters obtained using grid search on the class-balanced dataset using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, while Bagging and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were used on hyperparameters obtained using randomized search. Empirical results show that the recommended model is up to 98% accurate.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is the preferred technique for treating early gastric cancers including poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma without ulcerative findings. The histopathological classification of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma including signet ring cell carcinoma is of pivotal importance for determining further optimum cancer treatment(s) and clinical outcomes. Because conventional diagnosis by pathologists using microscopes is time-consuming and limited in terms of human resources, it is very important to develop computer-aided techniques that can rapidly and accurately inspect large numbers of histopathological specimen whole-slide images (WSIs). Computational pathology applications which can assist pathologists in detecting and classifying gastric poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma from ESD WSIs would be of great benefit for routine histopathological diagnostic workflow. In this study, we trained the deep learning model to classify poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in ESD WSIs by transfer and weakly supervised learning approaches. We evaluated the model on ESD, endoscopic biopsy, and surgical specimen WSI test sets, achieving and ROC-AUC up to 0.975 in gastric ESD test sets for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The deep learning model developed in this study demonstrates the high promising potential of deployment in a routine practical gastric ESD histopathological diagnostic workflow as a computer-aided diagnosis system.",

A recent contribution to Political Analysis by Di Cocco and Monechi (DCM) suggests that this research gap can be closed by predicting parties' populism scores from their election manifestos using supervised machine-learning. In this paper, we provide a detailed discussion of the suggested approach. Building on recent debates about the validation of machine-learning models, we argue that the validity checks provided in DCM's paper are insufficient. We conduct a series of additional validity checks and empirically demonstrate that the approach is not suitable for deriving populism scores from texts. We conclude that measuring populism over time and between countries remains an immense challenge for empirical research. More generally, our paper illustrates the importance of more comprehensive validations of supervised machine-learning models.",

Clinical assessment\nof such knee-related conditions has improved with recent advances in gait\nanalysis. Despite being a gold standard method, gait data acquired by motion capture\n(mocap) technology are highly non-linear and dimensional, which make\ntraditional gait analysis challenging. Thus, extrinsic algorithms need to be\nused to make sense of gait data. Supervised Machine Learning (ML)-based\nclassifiers outperform conventional statistical methods in revealing intrinsic\npatterns that can discern gait abnormalities when using mocap data, making them\na suitable tool for aiding diagnosis of knee OA.</p>\n\n<p><b>Research question</b></p>\n\n<p>Studies have demonstrated\nthe accuracy of supervised ML-based classifiers in gait analysis. However, these\ntechniques have not gained wide acceptance amongst biomechanists for two\nreasons: the reliability of such methods has not been assessed and there is no\nconsensus on which classifier or group of classifiers to select. Specifically,\nit is not clear whether classifiers that leverage optimal separating\nhyperplanes (OSH) or artificial neural networks (ANN) are more accurate and\nreliable.</p>\n\n<p><b>Methods</b></p>\n\n<p>A systematic review\nand meta-analysis were conducted to assess the capability of such algorithms to\npredict pathological kinematic and kinetic gait patterns as indicators of knee\nOA. With 153 eligible studies, 6 studies met the\ninclusion criteria for a subsequent meta-analysis, accounting for <a>273 healthy subjects and 313 patients </a>with symptomatic\nknee OA. The classification performance of supervised ML classifiers (OSH- or\nANN-based) used in these studies was quantitatively assessed and compared across\nfour following performance metrics: classification accuracy on the test set\n(ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve (AUC). </p>\n\n<p><b>Results</b></p>\n\n<p>There was no\nstatistically significant discrepancy in the ACC between OSH- and ANN-based\nclassifiers when dealing with kinetic and kinematic data concurrently, as well\nas when considering only kinematic data. However, there was a statistically\nsignificant difference in their SN and SP, with the ANN-based classifiers\nhaving higher SN and SP than OSH-based algorithms. As only one of the eligible studies reported AUC,\nthis metric could not be assessed statistically across studies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Significance</b></p>\n\n<p>This study supports\nthe use of ANN-based algorithms for classifying knee OA-related gait patterns as\nhaving a higher sensitivity and specificity than OSH-based classifiers. Considering\ntheir higher reliability, leveraging supervised ANN-based methods can aid biomechanists\nto diagnose knee OA objectively.</p>",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel transfer learning method for speech emotion recognition allowing us to obtain promising results when only few training data is available. With as low as 125 examples per emotion class, we were able to reach a higher accuracy than a strong baseline trained on 8 times more data. Our method leverages knowledge contained in pre-trained speech representations extracted from models trained on a more general self-supervised task which doesn&rsquo;t require human annotations, such as the wav2vec model. We provide detailed insights on the benefits of our approach by varying the training data size, which can help labeling teams to work more efficiently. We compare performance with other popular methods on the IEMOCAP dataset, a well-benchmarked dataset among the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research community.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that results can be greatly improved by combining acoustic and linguistic knowledge from transfer learning. We align acoustic pre-trained representations with semantic representations from the BERT model through an attention-based recurrent neural network. Performance improves significantly when combining both modalities and scales with the amount of data. When trained on the full IEMOCAP dataset, we reach a new state-of-the-art of 73.9% unweighted accuracy (UA). ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSleep disorder has become an ubiquitous problem in modern society. Related long-term clinical diagnoses suffer from data deficiency because analyzing sleep data requires enormous human expertise and labor. Moreover, current clinical sleep data acquisition processes usually cover only one night’s sleep history, which is too short to recognize long-term sleep patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach for sleep stage classification, combining clustering algorithms with the traditional supervised learning pipeline. Also, we propose two types of Gaussian transformations to make the semi-supervised learning process more robust and accurate. We reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via experiments on whole-night electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our algorithm evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on out-of-distribution human subjects. The experiments also prove that the proposed Gaussian transformations can significantly gain normality to EEG band-power features which in turn facilitate the semi-supervised learning process.",

        "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown tremendously in recent years. Typically, bilingual, and multilingual translation models have been deployed widely in machine translation and gained vast attention from the research community. On the contrary, few studies have focused on translating between spoken and sign languages, especially non-English languages. Prior works on Sign Language Translation (SLT) have shown that a mid-level sign gloss representation enhances translation performance. Therefore, this study presents a new large-scale Korean sign language dataset, the Museum-Commentary Korean Sign Gloss (MCKSG) dataset, including 3828 pairs of Korean sentences and their corresponding sign glosses used in Museum-Commentary contexts. In addition, we propose a translation framework based on self-supervised learning, where the pretext task is a text-to-text from a Korean sentence to its back-translation versions, then the pre-trained network will be fine-tuned on the MCKSG dataset. Using self-supervised learning help to overcome the drawback of a shortage of sign language data. Through experimental results, our proposed model outperforms a baseline BERT model by 6.22%.",

The algorithms of Machine learning used alone or combined with the SDN controller's northbound applications in order to make intelligent SDN. SDN is such potential networking design that blends network's programmability with central administration. The control and the data planes are separated in SDN, and the network with central management point is called SDN controller, which may be programmed and utilized as a brain of the network. Lately, the community of researchers have shown a greater willingness to take advantage of current advances in artificial intelligence to give the SDN best decision making and learning skills. Our research found that combining SDN with Intelligent Supervised Machine Learning (ISML) is very important for performance improvement. ISML is the development of algorithms that can generate broad patterns and assumptions from external source instances in order to portend the predestination of future instances. The ISML algorithms of classification goal is to categorize data based on past information. In data science problems, classification is used rather frequently. To solve such problems, a number of successful approaches were already presented, including rule-based techniques, instance-based techniques, logic-based techniques, and stochastic techniques. This study examined the ISML algorithms' efficiency by checking the precision, accuracy, and with or without SDN recall.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is the preferred technique for treating early gastric cancers including poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma without ulcerative findings. The histopathological classification of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma including signet ring cell carcinoma is of pivotal importance for determining further optimum cancer treatment(s) and clinical outcomes. Because conventional diagnosis by pathologists using microscopes is time-consuming and limited in terms of human resources, it is very important to develop computer-aided techniques that can rapidly and accurately inspect large numbers of histopathological specimen whole-slide images (WSIs). Computational pathology applications which can assist pathologists in detecting and classifying gastric poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma from ESD WSIs would be of great benefit for routine histopathological diagnostic workflow. In this study, we trained the deep learning model to classify poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in ESD WSIs by transfer and weakly supervised learning approaches. We evaluated the model on ESD, endoscopic biopsy, and surgical specimen WSI test sets, achieving and ROC-AUC up to 0.975 in gastric ESD test sets for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The deep learning model developed in this study demonstrates the high promising potential of deployment in a routine practical gastric ESD histopathological diagnostic workflow as a computer-aided diagnosis system.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art remote sensing scene classification methods employ different Convolutional Neural Network architectures for achieving very high classification performance. A trait shared by the majority of these methods is that the class associated with each example is ascertained by examining the activations of the last fully connected layer, and the networks are trained to minimize the cross-entropy between predictions extracted from this layer and ground-truth annotations. In this work, we extend this paradigm by introducing an additional output branch which maps the inputs to low dimensional representations, effectively extracting additional feature representations of the inputs. The proposed model imposes additional distance constrains on these representations with respect to identified class representatives, in addition to the traditional categorical cross-entropy between predictions and ground-truth. By extending the typical cross-entropy loss function with a distance learning function, our proposed approach achieves significant gains across a wide set of benchmark datasets in terms of classification, while providing additional evidence related to class membership and classification confidence.",

        "abstract": "Modern approaches to computing consumer price indices include the use of various data sources, such as web-scraped data or scanner data, which are very large in volume and need special processing techniques. In this paper, we address one of the main problems in the consumer price index calculation, namely the product classification, which cannot be performed manually when using large data sources. Therefore, we conducted an experiment on automatic product classification according to an international classification scheme. We combined 9 different word-embedding techniques with 13 classification methods with the aim of identifying the best combination in terms of the quality of the resultant classification. Because the dataset used in this experiment was significantly imbalanced, we compared these methods not only using the accuracy, F1-score, and AUC, but also using a weighted F1-score that better reflected the overall classification quality. Our experiment showed that logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests, combined with the FastText skip-gram embedding technique provided the best classification results, with superior values in performance metrics, as compared to other similar studies. An execution time analysis showed that, among the three mentioned methods, logistic regression was the fastest while the random forest recorded a longer execution time. We also provided per-class performance metrics and formulated an error analysis that enabled us to identify methods that could be excluded from the range of choices because they provided less reliable classifications for our purposes.",

A recent contribution to Political Analysis by Di Cocco and Monechi (DCM) suggests that this research gap can be closed by predicting parties' populism scores from their election manifestos using supervised machine-learning. In this paper, we provide a detailed discussion of the suggested approach. Building on recent debates about the validation of machine-learning models, we argue that the validity checks provided in DCM's paper are insufficient. We conduct a series of additional validity checks and empirically demonstrate that the approach is not suitable for deriving populism scores from texts. We conclude that measuring populism over time and between countries remains an immense challenge for empirical research. More generally, our paper illustrates the importance of more comprehensive validations of supervised machine-learning models.",

Clinical assessment\nof such knee-related conditions has improved with recent advances in gait\nanalysis. Despite being a gold standard method, gait data acquired by motion capture\n(mocap) technology are highly non-linear and dimensional, which make\ntraditional gait analysis challenging. Thus, extrinsic algorithms need to be\nused to make sense of gait data.

However, these\ntechniques have not gained wide acceptance amongst biomechanists for two\nreasons: the reliability of such methods has not been assessed and there is no\nconsensus on which classifier or group of classifiers to select. Specifically,\nit is not clear whether classifiers that leverage optimal separating\nhyperplanes (OSH) or artificial neural networks (ANN) are more accurate and\nreliable.</p>\n\n<p><b>Methods</b></p>\n\n<p>A systematic review\nand meta-analysis were conducted to assess the capability of such algorithms to\npredict pathological kinematic and kinetic gait patterns as indicators of knee\nOA.

The owner of the Bitcoin keeps their identity secret and is identified only by their unique address. This indicates that because Bitcoin offers anonymity, it may be utilized for illicit purposes on a regular basis. This study presents a supervised machine learning approach for predicting anonymous user activities on the Bitcoin Blockchain. As a training dataset to facilitate the user activities classification, we created a labelled dataset with over 4 million samples from exchanges, gambling, pools, and services whose identities and types were disclosed. The primary goal is to classify transactions on the blockchain in order to deanonymize them and distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate ones. On the class imbalanced dataset, we obtained impressive cross-validation (CV) accuracy using the Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting with default parameters and hyperparameters. Using Random Forest helped achieve the best cross-validation accuracy on default parameters and hyperparameters obtained using grid search on the class-balanced dataset using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, while Bagging and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were used on hyperparameters obtained using randomized search. Empirical results show that the recommended model is up to 98% accurate.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSleep disorder has become an ubiquitous problem in modern society. Related long-term clinical diagnoses suffer from data deficiency because analyzing sleep data requires enormous human expertise and labor. Moreover, current clinical sleep data acquisition processes usually cover only one night’s sleep history, which is too short to recognize long-term sleep patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach for sleep stage classification, combining clustering algorithms with the traditional supervised learning pipeline. Also, we propose two types of Gaussian transformations to make the semi-supervised learning process more robust and accurate. We reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm via experiments on whole-night electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our algorithm evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on out-of-distribution human subjects. The experiments also prove that the proposed Gaussian transformations can significantly gain normality to EEG band-power features which in turn facilitate the semi-supervised learning process.",

With as low as 125 examples per emotion class, we were able to reach a higher accuracy than a strong baseline trained on 8 times more data. Our method leverages knowledge contained in pre-trained speech representations extracted from models trained on a more general self-supervised task which doesn&rsquo;t require human annotations, such as the wav2vec model. We provide detailed insights on the benefits of our approach by varying the training data size, which can help labeling teams to work more efficiently. We compare performance with other popular methods on the IEMOCAP dataset, a well-benchmarked dataset among the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research community.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that results can be greatly improved by combining acoustic and linguistic knowledge from transfer learning. We align acoustic pre-trained representations with semantic representations from the BERT model through an attention-based recurrent neural network. Performance improves significantly when combining both modalities and scales with the amount of data. When trained on the full IEMOCAP dataset, we reach a new state-of-the-art of 73.9% unweighted accuracy (UA). ",

Besides, multivariate polynomial regression machine learning algorithm has been developed in this study to predict the evolution of static pressure for existing oil wells.",

        "abstract": "Distinguishing small earthquakes from man-made blasts at construction sites, in quarries and in mines is a non-trivial task during automatic event analysis and thus typically requires manual revision. We have developed station-specific classification models capable of both accurately assigning source type to seismic events in Sweden and filtering out spurious events from an automatic event catalogue. Our method divides all three components of the seismic records for each event into four non-overlapping time windows, corresponding to P-phase, P-coda, S-phase and S-coda, and computes the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) amplitude in each window. This process is repeated for a total of twenty narrow frequency bands. The resulting array of amplitudes is passed as inputs to fully connected Artificial Neural Network classifiers which attempt to filter out spurious events before distinguishing between natural earthquakes, industrial blasts and mining-induced events. The distinction includes e.g. distinguishing mining blasts from mining induced events, shallow earthquakes from blasts and differentiating between different types of mining induced events. The classifiers are trained on labelled seismic records dating from 2010 to 2021. They are already in use at the Swedish National Seismic Network where they serve as an aid to the routine manual analysis and as a tool for directly assigning preliminary source type to events in an automatic event catalogue. Initial results are promising and suggest that the method can accurately distinguish between different types of seismic events registered in Sweden and filter out the majority of spurious events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderwater acoustic object recognition is becoming attractive given the critical information available. However, this comes at the expense of large-scale annotated data, which is expensive to collect and annotate. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach of SE_RseNet_Decoder to recognizing insufficient sample underwater acoustic targets. Given this goal, we introduce the SE_RseNet_Decoder network containing supervised and unsupervised modules. Firstly, we leverage the supervised module to recognize the labeled signals and reduce the dimensional feature extraction of unlabeled samples. Then, the unsupervised network is designed as an auxiliary network to optimize the supervised network, which uses low-dimensional features to restore high-dimensional features of unlabeled samples to enhance the classification ability of the supervised network. We especially introduce ReLU activation function to connect the supervised and unsupervised modules that can help find a balanced relationship between classification and regression tasks for recognizing underwater acoustic signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework showing that the proposed approach achieves the best recognition accuracy compared with the other approaches with few samples. Moreover, the experimental results can demonstrate the optimal combination of variables for the recognition effect of the proposed method under multiple variables.",

This article will explain the classification of water sample data by applying a Machine Learning Algorithm, which includes modeling with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, K- Nearest Neighbor(KNN), XGBoost Classifier. Classification models produce varying degrees of accuracy. The highest accuracy is obtained in the Random Forest Classifier model with an accuracy rate of 78%.

        "abstract": "Disease classification based on machine learning has become a crucial research topic in the fields of genetics and molecular biology. Generally, disease classification involves a supervised learning style; i.e., it requires a large number of labelled samples to achieve good classification performance. However, in the majority of the cases, labelled samples are hard to obtain, so the amount of training data are limited. However, many unclassified (unlabelled) sequences have been deposited in public databases, which may help the training procedure. This method is called semi-supervised learning and is very useful in many applications. Self-training can be implemented using high- to low-confidence samples to prevent noisy samples from affecting the robustness of semi-supervised learning in the training process. The deep forest method with the hyperparameter settings used in this paper can achieve excellent performance. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel combined deep learning model and semi-supervised learning with self-training approach to improve the performance in disease classification, which utilizes unlabelled samples to update a mechanism designed to increase the number of high-confidence pseudo-labelled samples. The experimental results show that our proposed model can achieve good performance in disease classification and disease-causing gene identification.",

        "abstract": "The hickory (Carya cathayensis) nuts are considered as a traditional nut in Asia due to nutritional components such as phenols and steroids, amino acids and minerals, and especially high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. However, the edible quality of hickory nuts is rapidly deteriorated by oxidative rancidity. Deeper Masked autoencoders (DEEPMAE) with a unique structure for automatically extracting some features that could be scaleable from local to global for image classification, has been considered to be a state-of-the-art computer vision technique for grading tasks. This paper aims to present a novel and accurate method for grading hickory nuts with different oxidation levels. Owing to the use of self-supervised and supervised processes, this method is able to predict images of hickory nuts with different oxidation levels effectively, i.e., DEEPMAE can predict the oxidation level of nuts. The proposed DEEPMAE model was constructed from Vision Transformer (VIT) architecture which was followed by Masked autoencoders(MAE). This model was trained and tested on image datasets containing four classes, and the differences between these classes were mainly caused by varying levels of oxidation over time. The DEEPMAE model was able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 96.14% on the validation set and 96.42% on the test set. The results on the suggested model demonstrated that the application of the DEEPMAE model might be a promising method for grading hickory nuts with different levels of oxidation.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe mapping of metabolite-specific data to pathways within cellular metabolism is a major data analysis step needed for biochemical interpretation. A variety of machine learning approaches, particularly deep learning approaches, have been used to predict these metabolite-to-pathway mappings, utilizing a training dataset of known metabolite-to-pathway mappings. A few such training datasets have been derived from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG). However, several prior published machine learning approaches utilized an erroneous KEGG-derived training dataset that used SMILES molecular representations strings (KEGG-SMILES dataset) and contained a sizable proportion (∼26%) duplicate entries. The presence of so many duplicates taint the training and testing sets generated from k-fold cross-validation of the KEGG-SMILES dataset. Therefore, the k-fold cross-validation performance of the resulting machine learning models was grossly inflated by the erroneous presence of these duplicate entries. Here we describe and evaluate the KEGG-SMILES dataset so that others may avoid using it. We also identify the prior publications that utilized this erroneous KEGG-SMILES dataset so their machine learning results can be properly and critically evaluated. In addition, we demonstrate the reduction of model k-fold cross-validation performance after de-duplicating the KEGG-SMILES dataset. This is a cautionary tale about properly vetting prior published benchmark datasets before using them in machine learning approaches. We hope others will avoid similar mistakes.",

        "abstract": "AbstractElectric fields (E-fields) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs). Using state-of-the-art finite-element methods (FEM), it often takes tens of seconds to solve the PDEs for computing a high-resolution E-field, hampering the wide application of the E-field modeling in practice and research. To improve the E-field modeling’s computational efficiency, we developed a self-supervised deep learning (DL) method to compute precise TMS E-fields. Given a head model and the primary E-field generated by TMS coils, a DL model was built to generate a E-field by minimizing a loss function that measures how well the generated E-field fits the governing PDE. The DL model was trained in a self-supervised manner, which does not require any external supervision. We evaluated the DL model using both a simulated sphere head model and realistic head models of 125 individuals and compared the accuracy and computational speed of the DL model with a state-of-the-art FEM. In realistic head models, the DL model obtained accurate E-fields that were significantly correlated with the FEM solutions. The DL model could obtain precise E-fields within seconds for whole head models at a high spatial resolution, faster than the FEM. The DL model built for the simulated sphere head model also obtained an accurate E-field whose average difference from the analytical E-fields was 0.0054, comparable to the FEM solution. These results demonstrated that the self-supervised DL method could obtain precise E-fields comparable to the FEM solutions with improved computational speed.",

        "abstract": "\nBug localization, which is used to help programmers identify the\nlocation of bugs in source code, is an essential task in software\ndevelopment. Researchers have already made efforts to harness the\npowerful deep learning (DL) techniques to automate it. However, training\nbug localization model is usually challenging because it requires a\nlarge quantity of data labeled with the bug’s exact location, which is\ndifficult and time-consuming to collect. By contrast, obtaining bug\ndetection data with binary labels of whether there is a bug in the\nsource code is much simpler. This paper proposes a WEakly supervised bug\nLocaLization (WELL) method, which only uses the bug detection data with\nbinary labels to train a bug localization model. With CodeBERT finetuned\non the buggy-or-not binary labeled data, WELL can address bug\nlocalization in a weakly supervised manner. The evaluations on three\nmethod-level synthetic datasets and one file-level real-world dataset\nshow that WELL is significantly better than the existing SOTA model in\ntypical bug localization tasks such as variable misuse and other\nprogramming bugs.\n",

        "abstract": "Multireference (MR) diagnostics are common tools for identifying strongly correlated electronic structure that makes single reference (SR) methods (e.g., density functional theory or DFT) insufficient for accurate property prediction. However, MR diagnostics typically require computationally demanding correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) calculations, and diagnostics often disagree or fail to predict MR effects on properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach with virtual adversarial training (VAT) of an MR classifier using 15 WFT and DFT MR diagnostics as inputs. In semi-supervised learning, only the most extreme SR or MR points are labeled, and the remaining point labels are learned. The resulting VAT model outperforms the alternatives, as quantified by the distinct property distributions of SR- and MR-classified molecules. To reduce the cost of generating inputs to the VAT model, we leverage the VAT model’s robustness to noisy inputs by replacing WFT MR diagnostics with regression predictions in a MR decision engine workflow that preserves excellent performance. We demonstrate the transferability of our approach to larger molecules and those with distinct chemical composition from the training set. This MR decision engine demonstrates promise as a low-cost, high-accuracy approach to the automatic detection of strong correlation for predictive high-throughput screening.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDetailed knowledge of service utilisation and passenger load profiles are the basis for the design, operation, and adjustment of a public transport service. The advancement in sensing technologies enable transit operators to monitor the variabilities in passenger flows continuously and consistently. There is a growing body of literature on using supervised learning models with direct passenger counts from historical observations. However, the incomplete, inaccurate, and biased data from automatic sensors pose a challenge in this process. This paper proposes novel supervised learning models to estimate public transport service load profile onboard, based on 1) limited data collected on a subset of service vehicles by automatic passenger counting (APC) systems, and 2) fare data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems, with the specific consideration that the developed models can be transferred across different routes. This is motivated by the commonly “limited coverage” of automated passenger counter devices on service vehicles. We introduce an array of new models and a superior segment-based model which demonstrates remarkable improvement in model transferability and accuracy. The proposed methodology uses separate methods in different segments of a transit line.\nThe proposed models are applied to three tram lines in Melbourne, Australia, where different types of shortcomings exist in the automated data. The test results show that the proposed models can be transferred and applied to other transit route without historical observations. This would allow transit operators to reduce the number of required devices and monitor service utilization more cost-efficiently, especially in public transport networks where AFC coverage is usually incomplete and negatively skewed. The information on service utilization will not only help operators to accommodate the variability in passenger demand, but also assist passengers in journey planning to avoid service overcrowding.",

A novel wire rope image preprocessing method is proposed, which can automatically adjust the pose of wire rope, remove the background information of wire rope image, and extract the damage area of wire rope. In response to the problem that deep learning based wire rope damage detection methods require a large amount of labeled data, a convolutional neural network model WR-CNN adapted to the steel wire rope dataset is designed, And combine WR-CNN with the semi-supervised learning example provided by Temporal Ensembling to form WR-TE-CNN. Aiming at the problem that the existing detection methods of broken wire damage do not consider the difference information between different types of damage and the similar information between the same type of damage, the distance loss function is introduced into the loss function of WR-TE-CNN and the characteristic quantity of calculating distance loss function is improved ( Before the improvement it was called WR-TE-DLCNN, after the improvement it was called WR-TE-IDLCNN ). The experimental results show that When the proportion of labeled data is 0.5, the wire breakage recognition rate of WR-TE-IDLCNN exceeds WR-CNN and is 99.04%. WR-TE-IDLCNN can further utilize the information between different types of damage and between the same types on the basis of WR-TE-DLCNN.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and robust segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images plays a vital role in many clinical applications such as diagnosis and treatment planning. With the massive increase in labeled data, deep learning has achieved great success in image segmentation. However, for medical images, the acquisition of labeled data is usually expensive because generating accurate annotations requires expertise and time, especially in 3D images. To reduce the cost of labeling, many approaches have been proposed in recent years to develop a high-performance medical image segmentation model to reduce the labeling data. For example, combining user interaction with deep neural networks to interactively perform image segmentation can reduce the labeling effort. Self-supervised learning methods utilize unlabeled data to train the model in a supervised manner, learn the basics and then perform knowledge transfer. Semi-supervised learning frameworks learn directly from a limited amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to get high quality segmentation results. Weakly supervised learning approaches learn image segmentation from borders, graffiti, or image-level labels instead of using pixel-level labeling, which reduces the burden of labeling. However, the performance of weakly supervised learning and self-supervised learning is still limited on medical image segmentation tasks, especially on 3D medical images. In addition to this, a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data are more in line with actual clinical scenarios. Therefore, semi-supervised learning strategies become very important in the field of medical image processing.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe mapping of metabolite-specific data to pathways within cellular metabolism is a major data analysis step needed for biochemical interpretation. A variety of machine learning approaches, particularly deep learning approaches, have been used to predict these metabolite-to-pathway mappings, utilizing a training dataset of known metabolite-to-pathway mappings. A few such training datasets have been derived from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG). However, several prior published machine learning approaches utilized an erroneous KEGG-derived training dataset that used SMILES molecular representations strings (KEGG-SMILES dataset) and contained a sizable proportion (∼26%) duplicate entries. The presence of so many duplicates taint the training and testing sets generated from k-fold cross-validation of the KEGG-SMILES dataset. Therefore, the k-fold cross-validation performance of the resulting machine learning models was grossly inflated by the erroneous presence of these duplicate entries. Here we describe and evaluate the KEGG-SMILES dataset so that others may avoid using it. We also identify the prior publications that utilized this erroneous KEGG-SMILES dataset so their machine learning results can be properly and critically evaluated. In addition, we demonstrate the reduction of model k-fold cross-validation performance after de-duplicating the KEGG-SMILES dataset. This is a cautionary tale about properly vetting prior published benchmark datasets before using them in machine learning approaches. We hope others will avoid similar mistakes.",

        "abstract": "AbstractElectric fields (E-fields) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs). Using state-of-the-art finite-element methods (FEM), it often takes tens of seconds to solve the PDEs for computing a high-resolution E-field, hampering the wide application of the E-field modeling in practice and research. To improve the E-field modeling’s computational efficiency, we developed a self-supervised deep learning (DL) method to compute precise TMS E-fields. Given a head model and the primary E-field generated by TMS coils, a DL model was built to generate a E-field by minimizing a loss function that measures how well the generated E-field fits the governing PDE. The DL model was trained in a self-supervised manner, which does not require any external supervision. We evaluated the DL model using both a simulated sphere head model and realistic head models of 125 individuals and compared the accuracy and computational speed of the DL model with a state-of-the-art FEM. In realistic head models, the DL model obtained accurate E-fields that were significantly correlated with the FEM solutions. The DL model could obtain precise E-fields within seconds for whole head models at a high spatial resolution, faster than the FEM. The DL model built for the simulated sphere head model also obtained an accurate E-field whose average difference from the analytical E-fields was 0.0054, comparable to the FEM solution. These results demonstrated that the self-supervised DL method could obtain precise E-fields comparable to the FEM solutions with improved computational speed.",

Researchers have already made efforts to harness the\npowerful deep learning (DL) techniques to automate it. However, training\nbug localization model is usually challenging because it requires a\nlarge quantity of data labeled with the bug’s exact location, which is\ndifficult and time-consuming to collect. By contrast, obtaining bug\ndetection data with binary labels of whether there is a bug in the\nsource code is much simpler. This paper proposes a WEakly supervised bug\nLocaLization (WELL) method, which only uses the bug detection data with\nbinary labels to train a bug localization model. With CodeBERT finetuned\non the buggy-or-not binary labeled data, WELL can address bug\nlocalization in a weakly supervised manner. The evaluations on three\nmethod-level synthetic datasets and one file-level real-world dataset\nshow that WELL is significantly better than the existing SOTA model in\ntypical bug localization tasks such as variable misuse and other\nprogramming bugs.\n",

        "abstract": "Multireference (MR) diagnostics are common tools for identifying strongly correlated electronic structure that makes single reference (SR) methods (e.g., density functional theory or DFT) insufficient for accurate property prediction. However, MR diagnostics typically require computationally demanding correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) calculations, and diagnostics often disagree or fail to predict MR effects on properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach with virtual adversarial training (VAT) of an MR classifier using 15 WFT and DFT MR diagnostics as inputs. In semi-supervised learning, only the most extreme SR or MR points are labeled, and the remaining point labels are learned. The resulting VAT model outperforms the alternatives, as quantified by the distinct property distributions of SR- and MR-classified molecules. To reduce the cost of generating inputs to the VAT model, we leverage the VAT model’s robustness to noisy inputs by replacing WFT MR diagnostics with regression predictions in a MR decision engine workflow that preserves excellent performance. We demonstrate the transferability of our approach to larger molecules and those with distinct chemical composition from the training set. This MR decision engine demonstrates promise as a low-cost, high-accuracy approach to the automatic detection of strong correlation for predictive high-throughput screening.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDetailed knowledge of service utilisation and passenger load profiles are the basis for the design, operation, and adjustment of a public transport service. The advancement in sensing technologies enable transit operators to monitor the variabilities in passenger flows continuously and consistently. There is a growing body of literature on using supervised learning models with direct passenger counts from historical observations. However, the incomplete, inaccurate, and biased data from automatic sensors pose a challenge in this process. This paper proposes novel supervised learning models to estimate public transport service load profile onboard, based on 1) limited data collected on a subset of service vehicles by automatic passenger counting (APC) systems, and 2) fare data collected by automated fare collection (AFC) systems, with the specific consideration that the developed models can be transferred across different routes. This is motivated by the commonly “limited coverage” of automated passenger counter devices on service vehicles. We introduce an array of new models and a superior segment-based model which demonstrates remarkable improvement in model transferability and accuracy. The proposed methodology uses separate methods in different segments of a transit line.\nThe proposed models are applied to three tram lines in Melbourne, Australia, where different types of shortcomings exist in the automated data. The test results show that the proposed models can be transferred and applied to other transit route without historical observations. This would allow transit operators to reduce the number of required devices and monitor service utilization more cost-efficiently, especially in public transport networks where AFC coverage is usually incomplete and negatively skewed. The information on service utilization will not only help operators to accommodate the variability in passenger demand, but also assist passengers in journey planning to avoid service overcrowding.",

A novel wire rope image preprocessing method is proposed, which can automatically adjust the pose of wire rope, remove the background information of wire rope image, and extract the damage area of wire rope. In response to the problem that deep learning based wire rope damage detection methods require a large amount of labeled data, a convolutional neural network model WR-CNN adapted to the steel wire rope dataset is designed, And combine WR-CNN with the semi-supervised learning example provided by Temporal Ensembling to form WR-TE-CNN. Aiming at the problem that the existing detection methods of broken wire damage do not consider the difference information between different types of damage and the similar information between the same type of damage, the distance loss function is introduced into the loss function of WR-TE-CNN and the characteristic quantity of calculating distance loss function is improved ( Before the improvement it was called WR-TE-DLCNN, after the improvement it was called WR-TE-IDLCNN ). The experimental results show that When the proportion of labeled data is 0.5, the wire breakage recognition rate of WR-TE-IDLCNN exceeds WR-CNN and is 99.04%. WR-TE-IDLCNN can further utilize the information between different types of damage and between the same types on the basis of WR-TE-DLCNN.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and robust segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images plays a vital role in many clinical applications such as diagnosis and treatment planning. With the massive increase in labeled data, deep learning has achieved great success in image segmentation. However, for medical images, the acquisition of labeled data is usually expensive because generating accurate annotations requires expertise and time, especially in 3D images. To reduce the cost of labeling, many approaches have been proposed in recent years to develop a high-performance medical image segmentation model to reduce the labeling data. For example, combining user interaction with deep neural networks to interactively perform image segmentation can reduce the labeling effort. Self-supervised learning methods utilize unlabeled data to train the model in a supervised manner, learn the basics and then perform knowledge transfer. Semi-supervised learning frameworks learn directly from a limited amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to get high quality segmentation results. Weakly supervised learning approaches learn image segmentation from borders, graffiti, or image-level labels instead of using pixel-level labeling, which reduces the burden of labeling. However, the performance of weakly supervised learning and self-supervised learning is still limited on medical image segmentation tasks, especially on 3D medical images. In addition to this, a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data are more in line with actual clinical scenarios. Therefore, semi-supervised learning strategies become very important in the field of medical image processing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBeing a significant repository of Buddhist imagery, Thangka images are valuable historical materials of Tibetan studies, which covers many domains such as Tibetan history, politics, culture, social life and even traditional medicine and astronomy. Thangka cultural element images are the essence of Thangka images. Hence Thangka cultural element images classification is one of the most important work of knowledge representation and mining in the field of Thangka, and is the foundation of digital protection of Thangka images. However, due to the limited quantity, high complexity and the intricate textures of Thangka images, the classification of Thangka images is limited to a small number of categories and coarse granularity. Thus a novel fusion texture feature dual-branch Thangka cultural elements classification model based on the attention mechanism and self-supervised contrastive learning has been proposed in this paper. Specifically, to address the issue of insufficient labeled samples and improve the classification performance, this method utilizes a large amount of unlabeled irrelevant data to pre-train the feature extractor through self-supervised learning. During the fine-tuning stage of the downstream task, a dual-branch feature extraction structure incorporating texture features has been designed, and MS-Triplet Attetnion proposed by us is used for the integration of important features. Additionally, to address the problem of sample imbalance and the existence of a large number of difficult samples in the Thangka cultural element data set, the Gradient Harmonizing Mechanism Loss has been adopted, and it has been improved by introducing a self designed adaptive mechanism. The experimental results on Thangka cultural elements dataset prove the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.The source code of our proposed algorithm and the related datasets is available at https://github.com/WiniTang/MS-BiCLR.",

        "abstract": "The article deals with the problem of noise effect on semi-supervised learning. The goal of this article is to analyze the impact of noise on the accuracy of binary classification models created using three semi-supervised learning algorithms, namely Simple Recycled Selection, Incrementally Reinforced Selection, and Hybrid Algorithm, using Support Vector Machines to build a base classifier. Different algorithms to compute similarity matrices, namely Radial Bias Function, Cosine Similarity, and K-Nearest Neighbours were analyzed to understand their effect on model accuracy. For benchmarking purposes, datasets from the UCI repository were used. To test the noise effect, different amounts of artificially generated randomly-labeled samples were introduced into the dataset using three strategies (labeled, unlabeled, and mixed) and compared to the baseline classifier trained with the original dataset and the classifier trained on the reduced-size original dataset. The results show that the introduction of random noise into the labeled samples decreases classifier accuracy, while a moderate amount of noise in unmarked samples can have a positive effect on classifier accuracy.",

The graph nature of data, with a large number of nodes, causes different obstacles, including a considerable amount of unrelated features in matrices, as well as high dispersion and imbalanced classes in the dataset. To address these issues, Auto-encoders and a combination of semi-supervised learning and the GAN algorithm, called SGAN, were used. This paper deploys a smaller number of labels and applies SGAN as a classifier. The results of this test showed that the accuracy reached 81% in detecting fake accounts using only 100 labeled samples.",

        "abstract": "Switzerland experienced earthquakes mainly in the Basel area and within its Alpine region, with the Canton Valais standing out as one of the most active zones. The Rhone Valley, crossing the entire canton, is characterized by sediment deposits with a thickness reaching up to 800 meters. The valley&#8217;s topography and the significant contrast in seismic wave velocities between sediments and the surrounding rock, make it susceptible to 2D/3D effects, leading to significant site amplification phenomena. To develop local amplification models that integrate geological and geophysical data, specific areas &#8211; of relevance from the risk point of view - in the Rhone Valley were selected. One area is Sion, where geophysical data were acquired during the earthquake risk model for Switzerland project (ERM-CH). The dataset encompasses 313 single station noise measurements and seismic records from 10 seismic stations. The single station measurements were employed to compute horizontal to vertical spectral ratios (HVSR), while earthquake recordings were utilized to derive empirical spectral modelling amplification functions (ESM). Our approach involves the application of the canonical correlation (CC) statistical method, which explores the correlation between two sets of variables by identifying linear combinations that exhibit maximum correlation. Specifically, we conducted CC analysis between the sets of HVSR and ESM using as calibration dataset of 172 free-field and urban free-field stations run by the Swiss Seismological Service over the entire Swiss territory. Using canonical correlation, we developed a method to predict the ESM for a specific site based on its HVSR information. Additionally, we employed a correlation analysis based on the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient as an alternative method. This approach was utilized to group the Sion HVSR, with the seismic station HVSR, for which ESM is available, serving as the centroid. This grouping resulted in the assignment of each of the 313 HVSRs to one of the 10 amplification functions. Consequently, we extrapolated amplification values to various locations and employed kriging for interpolation to generate amplification maps at specific frequencies. The utilization of different amplification models at defined frequencies allows for the assessment and definition of epistemic uncertainties in our findings.",

These bright low-cost plasma sources were operated under non-equilibrium conditions, producing spectra with a complex and variable sensitivity to trace levels of added gases. A data-driven machine learning approach based on Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was implemented for CH4 concentrations up to 100 ppm in He, to provide binary classification of samples above or below a threshold of 2 ppm. With a low-resolution spectrometer and a custom spectral alignment procedure, a prediction accuracy of 98% was achieved, demonstrating the power of machine learning with otherwise prohibitively complex spectral analysis.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nEndoscopy, a widely used medical procedure for examining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to detect potential disorders, poses challenges in manual diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms and difficulties in accessing affected areas. While supervised machine learning models have proven effective in assisting clinical diagnosis of GI disorders, the scarcity of image-label pairs created by medical experts limits their availability. To address these limitations, we propose a curriculum self-supervised learning framework inspired by human curriculum learning. Our approach leverages the HyperKvasir dataset, which comprises 100k unlabeled GI images for pre-training and 10k labeled GI images for fine-tuning. By adopting our proposed method, we achieved an impressive top-1 accuracy of 88.92% and an F1 score of 73.39%. This represents a 2.1% increase over vanilla SimSiam for the top-1 accuracy and a 1.9% increase for the F1 score. The combination of self-supervised learning and a curriculum-based approach demonstrates the efficacy of our framework in advancing the diagnosis of GI disorders. Our study highlights the potential of curriculum self-supervised learning in utilizing unlabeled GI tract images to improve the diagnosis of GI disorders, paving the way for more accurate and efficient diagnosis in GI endoscopy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pleural Mesothelioma (PM) is an unusual, belligerent tumor that rapidly develops into cancer in the pleura of the lungs. Pleural Mesothelioma is a common type of Mesothelioma that accounts for about 75% of all Mesothelioma diagnosed yearly in the U.S. Diagnosis of Mesothelioma takes several months and is expensive. Given the risk and constraints associated with PM diagnosis, early identification of this ailment is essential for patient health. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we use artificial intelligence algorithms recommending the best fit model for early diagnosis and prognosis of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). METHODS: We retrospectively retrieved patients’ clinical data collected by Dicle University, Turkey and applied multilayered perceptron (MLP), voted perceptron (VP), Clojure classifier (CC), kernel logistic regression (KLR), stochastic gradient decent (SGD), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), Hoeffding tree (VFDT), and primal estimated sub-gradient solver for support vector machine (s-Pegasos). We evaluated the models, compared and tested them using paired t-test (corrected) at 0.05 significance based on their respective classification accuracy, f-measure, precision, recall, root mean squared error, receivers’ characteristic curve (ROC), and precision-recall curve (PRC). RESULTS: In phase 1, SGD, AdaBoost.M1, KLR, MLP, VFDT generate optimal results with the highest possible performance measures. In phase 2, AdaBoost, with a classification accuracy of 71.29%, outperformed all other algorithms. C-reactive protein, platelet count, duration of symptoms, gender, and pleural protein were found to be the most relevant predictors that can prognosticate Mesothelioma. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that data obtained from biopsy and imaging tests are strong predictors of Mesothelioma but are associated with a high cost; however, they can identify Mesothelioma with optimal accuracy.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHypergraphs are powerful tools for modeling complex interactions across various domains, including biomedicine. However, learning meaningful node representations from hypergraphs remains a challenge. Existing supervised methods often lack generalizability, thereby limiting their real-world applications. We propose a new method, Pre-trained Hypergraph Convolutional Neural Networks with Self-supervised Learning (PhyGCN), which leverages hypergraph structure for self-supervision to enhance node representations. PhyGCN introduces a unique training strategy that integrates variable hyperedge sizes with self-supervised learning, enabling improved generalization to unseen data. Applications on multi-way chromatin interactions and polypharmacy side-effects demonstrate the effectiveness of PhyGCN. As a generic framework for high-order interaction datasets with abundant unlabeled data, PhyGCN holds strong potential for enhancing hypergraph node representations across various domains.",

Remaining aware of the surface conditions of buildings and making timely decisions regarding maintenance are crucial. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as a key technique in image classification methods. It can quickly handle large amounts of symmetry and asymmetry in images. In this study, three supervised machine learning models were trained and tested on images of efflorescence, and the performance of the models was compared. The results indicated that the support vector machine (SVM) model achieved the highest accuracy in classifying efflorescence (90.2%). The accuracy rates of the maximum likelihood (ML) and random forest (RF) models were 89.8% and 87.0%, respectively. This study examined the influence of different light sources and illumination intensity on classification models. The results indicated that light source conditions cause errors in image detection, and the machine learning field must prioritize resolving this problem.",

Storing data in caches on user terminals (UTs) and small base stations (SBSs) faces challenges with respect to the decision of cache contents. Here, a multi‐objective cache content strategy that aims to maximise the cache hitrate of SBSs in mobile edge networks (MENs) is proposed. The multi‐objective cache placement optimisation is formulated as a classification problem. Unlike previous work, mobility input attributes such as user locations, contact duration, communication ranges, contact probability between UTs and SBSs, etc. as well as content popularity and the correlation between these input attributes separating the decision space into two regions of cache and not cache are used.Stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used for the training of three supervised machine learning techniques: artificial neural network ANN, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression LR to define the hyperplane that separates the cache content decision space. Simulation results show that compared with the weighted‐sum approach, the SBSs cache hit rates increase on the average by 18.58%, 18.52%, and 18.2%, and the total energy consumption values decrease on the average by 33.49%, 53.19%, and 49.9% for ANN, SVM, and LR, respectively.</p>",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTReconstruction of neural network connectivity is a central focus of neuroscience. The ability to use neuronal connection information to predict activity at single unit resolution and decipher its effect on whole systems can provide critical information about behavior and cognitive processing. Neuronal sensing modalities come in varying forms, but there is yet to exist a modality that can deliver readouts that sufficiently address the spatiotemporal constraints of biological nervous systems. This necessitates supplementary approaches that rely on mathematical models to mitigate physical limitations and decode network features. Here, we introduce a simple proof-of-concept model that addresses temporal constraints by reconstructing presynaptic connections from temporally blurry data. We use a variation of the perceptron algorithm to process firing rate information at multiple time constraints for a heterogenous feed-forward network of excitatory, inhibitory, and unconnected presynaptic units. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm under these conditions and determine the optimal learning rate, firing rate, and the ability to reconstruct single unit spikes for a given degree of temporal blur. We then test our method on a physiologically relevant configuration by sampling network subpopulations of leaky integrate-and-fire neuronal models displaying bursting firing patterns and find comparable learning rates for optimized reconstruction of network connectivity. Our method provides a recipe for reverse engineering neural networks based on limited data quality that can be extended to more complicated readouts and connectivity distributions relevant to multiple brain circuits.",

Indeed, there are a variety of confusing sustainability certifications and few labels capturing the overall environmental impact of products, as the existing procedures for assessing the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle are time consuming, costly, and require a lot of data and input from domain experts. This paper explores the use of supervised machine learning tools to extrapolate the results of existing life cycle assessment studies (LCAs) and to develop a model—applied to the clothing product category—that could easily and quickly assess the products’ environmental sustainability throughout their life cycle. More precisely, we assemble a dataset of clothing products with their life cycle characteristics and corresponding known total environmental impact and test, on a 5-fold cross-validation basis, nine state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms. Among them, the random forest algorithm has the best performance with an average accuracy of 91% over the five folds. The resulting model provides rapid environmental feedback on a variety of clothing products with the limited data available to online retailers. It could be used to quickly provide interested consumers with product-level sustainability information, or even to develop a unique and all-inclusive environmental label.",

We discuss the current state of the art tools for the online detection of combustion instabilities, namely the Hurst exponent and Auto-Regressive model, the precursors they detect and how they go about doing so. We show that the generality of these tools comes at the cost of predictive power, which can be recovered using supervised machine learning. To demonstrate this we apply two different supervised machine learning approaches (using Hidden Markov Models and Automatic Machine Learning) to the classification of the state of a combustor given the dynamic pressure readings. We then observe the changes in predictive power when different information is added or removed from the signal. We find that the HMM based approach reduces to the AR model when the signal is normalised. We also find that the performance of a model trained on a signal transformed using the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) can be met by a model trained on the Hurst exponent and the DFA transformation at a single (short) scale.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\"Sweet spots\" in the unconventional reservoirs such as organic-rich mudrocks are zones with high productivity. However, identifying such regions in unconventional reservoirs depends non-only on their petrophysical and but also on their geomechanical properties. Supervised learning methods can help in integrating numerical simulation and legacy field data in sweet-spot identification workflows and enhance their analysis in complex reservoirs. The objectives of this paper are to: (i) demonstrate the use of supervised learning in parameter selection and evaluation for fracture design and (ii) provide non-linear models for sweet-spot analysis in complex reservoirs.\nWe used fracture simulator that combines with fracture deformation with fluid-flow in discrete fracture networks. We started by selecting different geomechanical rock properties related to its fracability. We then used quasi-random design approach to obtain wide variation in aforementioned properties and performed 200 fracture simulations using the hydraulic fracturing simulator. We used the short-term Stimulated Reservoir Volumes (SRV) obtained at the end of numerical simulations, to quantify the performance of hydraulic fracturing operations. We used supervised learning techniques like support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests to perform parameter ranking and create non-linear regression models that can correlate the SRV to formation geomechanical properties.\nThe inputs for the analysis are: initial aperture, toughness, dilation angle, closure stress, and friction coefficient of initial fractures, stress anisotropy, shear modulus and a ratio of the reservoir rock. We analyzed the results using β-linear and multinomial regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. The linear models and non-linear models can explain up to 89.1% of output variance. The classification accuracy of support vector machines was at most 35% higher than other algorithms like random forests. Parameter rating using non-linear models showed that stress anisotropy and dilation angle demonstrated the highest effect on SRVs. Shear modulus and fracture toughness show minimal effect on the SRV but these parameters might still be useful they could be correlated to other formation parameters.\nThe outcomes of this paper demonstrated that parameters pertaining to unpropped fracture conductivity play a significant role in determining the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments. We have also compared the performances of supervised machine learning algorithms in assessing the impact of rock properties on fracturing treatments. Such supervised machine learning algorithms can help integrate field legacy data and numerical simulation outputs to develop proxy models that improve sweet-spot analysis and production estimates in unconventional reservoirs.",

Such post-processors accept the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and feature vectors resulting from a database search, train a machine learning classifier, and recalibrate PSMs using the trained parameters, often yielding significantly more identified peptides across q-value thresholds. However, current state-of-the-art post-processors rely on shallow machine learning methods, such as support vector machines. In contrast, the powerful training capabilities of deep learning models have displayed superior performance to shallow models in an ever-growing number of other fields. In this work, we show that deep models significantly improve the recalibration of PSMs compared to the most accurate and widely-used post-processors, such as Percolator and PeptideProphet. Furthermore, we show that deep learning is able to adaptively analyze complex datasets and features for more accurate universal post-processing, leading to both improved Prosit analysis and markedly better recalibration of recently developed database-search functions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nTotal water storage anomalies (TWSAs) describe the variations of the terrestrial water cycle, which is essential for better understanding our climate system. This study proposes a self-supervised data assimilation model with a novel loss function to provide a global TWSA product with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. The model combines the hydrological simulations as well as the measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite missions. The efficiency of the high-resolution information is proved by closing the water balance equation while preserving large-scale accuracy inherited from the GRACE(-FO) measurements. They contribute to monitoring natural hazards locally and show potential for better understanding the impacts of natural and anthropogenic activities on the water cycle. We anticipate our approach to be generally applicable to other TWSA data sources and the resulting product to be valuable for the geoscience community and society.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMultimodal learning analytics provides researchers new tools and techniques to capture different types of data from complex learning activities in dynamic learning environments. This paper investigates the use of diverse sensors, including computer vision, user‐generated content, and data from the learning objects (physical computing components), to record high‐fidelity synchronised multimodal recordings of small groups of learners interacting. We processed and extracted different aspects of the students' interactions to answer the following question: Which features of student group work are good predictors of team success in open‐ended tasks with physical computing? To answer this question, we have explored different supervised machine learning approaches (traditional and deep learning techniques) to analyse the data coming from multiple sources. The results illustrate that state‐of‐the‐art computational techniques can be used to generate insights into the \"black box\" of learning in students' project‐based activities. The features identified from the analysis show that distance between learners' hands and faces is a strong predictor of students' artefact quality, which can indicate the value of student collaboration. Our research shows that new and promising approaches such as neural networks, and more traditional regression approaches can both be used to classify multimodal learning analytics data, and both have advantages and disadvantages depending on the research questions and contexts being investigated. The work presented here is a significant contribution towards developing techniques to automatically identify the key aspects of students success in project‐based learning environments, and to ultimately help teachers provide appropriate and timely support to students in these fundamental aspects.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSpiking neural networks (SNNs) are more energy- and resource-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, supervised SNN learning is a challenging task due to non-differentiability of spikes and computation of complex terms. Moreover, the design of SNN learning engines is not an easy task due to limited hardware resources and tight energy constraints. In this article, a novel hardware-efficient SNN back-propagation scheme that offers fast convergence is proposed. The learning scheme does not require any complex operation such as error normalization and weight-threshold balancing, and can achieve an accuracy of around 97.5% on MNIST dataset using only 158,800 synapses. The multiplier-less inference engine trained using the proposed hard sigmoid SNN training (HaSiST) scheme can operate at a frequency of 135 MHz and consumes only 1.03 slice registers per synapse, 2.8 slice look-up tables, and can infer about 0.03$$\\times {\\varvec{10}}^{\\varvec{9}}$$\n\n×\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n features in a second, equivalent to 9.44 giga synaptic operations per second (GSOPS). The article also presents a high-speed, cost-efficient SNN training engine that consumes only 2.63 slice registers per synapse, 37.84 slice look-up tables per synapse, and can operate at a maximum computational frequency of around 50 MHz on a Virtex 6 FPGA.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationIt is expected that the difference in the thermal stability of mesophilic and thermophilic proteins arises, in part at least, from the differences in their molecular structures and amino acid compositions. Existing machine learning approaches for supervised classification of proteins rely on the features derived from the structural networks and the amino acid sequences. However, the network features used leave out several important network centrality values, the statistic used is a simple average and the sequence features used are hand-picked leading to an accuracy of 90%.ResultsWe show that discriminating sub-sequences of the amino acid sequences can significantly improve classification accuracy compared to the existing approaches of counting amino acids, di-peptide or even tri-peptide bonds. We identify notions of network centrality, specifically that depends on the distances between Cα atoms, that appears to correlate better with thermal stability compared to the existing network features. We also show how to generate better statistics from the node- and edge-wise centrality values that more accurately captures the variations in their values for different types of proteins. These improved feature selection techniques make it possible to classify between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins with 96% accuracy and 99% area under ROC.AvailabilityThe dataset and source code used are available at https://github.com/ankits0207/Protein_Classification_BIO699Contactdbera@iiitd.ac.inonline.",

        "abstract": "<p>With the growth of mobile data traffic in wireless networks, caches are used to bring data closer to mobile users and to minimise the traffic load on macro base station (MBS). Storing data in caches on user terminals (UTs) and small base stations (SBSs) faces challenges with respect to the decision of cache contents. Here, a multi‐objective cache content strategy that aims to maximise the cache hitrate of SBSs in mobile edge networks (MENs) is proposed. The multi‐objective cache placement optimisation is formulated as a classification problem. Unlike previous work, mobility input attributes such as user locations, contact duration, communication ranges, contact probability between UTs and SBSs, etc. as well as content popularity and the correlation between these input attributes separating the decision space into two regions of cache and not cache are used.Stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used for the training of three supervised machine learning techniques: artificial neural network ANN, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression LR to define the hyperplane that separates the cache content decision space. Simulation results show that compared with the weighted‐sum approach, the SBSs cache hit rates increase on the average by 18.58%, 18.52%, and 18.2%, and the total energy consumption values decrease on the average by 33.49%, 53.19%, and 49.9% for ANN, SVM, and LR, respectively.</p>",

Despite this, the interpretation of mass spectra remains a challenge to overcome. Existing methods heavily rely on limited spectral libraries and human expertise, so we have taken an orthogonal approach. Here, we introduce a foundation transformer-based model pre-trained in a self-supervised way on millions of unlabeled mass spectra from our new GeMS (GNPS Experimental Mass Spectra) dataset. We show that by learning to predict masked spectral peaks and chromatographic retention orders, our model discovers rich molecular representations, which we name DreaMS (Deep Representations Empowering the Annotation of Mass Spectra). Fine-tuning the neural network for predicting spectral similarity, molecular fingerprints, chemical properties, and the presence of fluorine from mass spectra yields state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. This underscores the practical utility of DreaMS across diverse spectrum interpretation tasks and establishes it as a foundation for future advances in the field.",

        "abstract": "\nUNSTRUCTURED\nTherapeutic and interventional digital health solutions often use machine learning (ML) models to make predictions of repeated adverse health outcomes. For example, models may be used to analyze patient data and identify patterns that can anticipate the likelihood of disease exacerbations, enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans to improve overall health outcomes. However, many digital health applications require the prediction of highly heterogeneous health events. The cross-subject variability of these events makes traditional ML approaches, where a single generalized model is trained to classify a particular condition, infeasible without overfitting to the training set. A natural solution is to train a separate model for each individual or subgroup, essentially overfitting the model to the unique characteristics of the individual without negatively overfitting in terms of the desired prediction task. Unfortunately, such an approach requires extensive data labels from each individual, a reality that has rendered personalized ML infeasible for precision healthcare. The recent popularization of self-supervised learning, however, provides a solution to this issue: by pre-training deep learning models on the vast array of unlabeled data streams arising from patient generated health data, personalized models can be fine-tuned to predict the health outcome of interest with much fewer labels, making personalization of deep learning models much more achievable from a practical perspective. This perspective describes the current state-of-the-art in both self-supervised learning and ML personalization for healthcare as well as growing efforts to combine these two ideas. Personalized self-supervised learning is likely to enable a wide array of digital therapeutics in the coming years.\n",

We consider a challenging yet practical scenario: a few data sources own a  small amount of labeled data, while the rest mass sources own purely unlabeled data. Classical FL requires each client to have enough labeled data for local training, thus is not applicable in this scenario. In this work, we design an effective federated semi-supervised learning framework (FedSSL) to fully leverage both labeled and unlabeled data sources. We establish a unified data space across all participating agents, so that each agent can generate mixed data samples to boost semi-supervised learning (SSL), while keeping data locality. We further show that FedSSL can integrate differential privacy protection techniques to prevent labeled data leakage at the cost of minimum performance degradation. On SSL tasks with as small as 0.17% and 1% of MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets as labeled data, respectively, our approach can achieve 5-20% performance boost over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHistopathological images contain abundant phenotypic information and pathological patterns, which are the gold standards for disease diagnosis and essential for the prediction of patient prognosis and treatment outcome. In recent years, computer-automated analysis techniques for histopathological images have been urgently required in clinical practice, and deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural networks have gradually become the mainstream in the field of digital pathology. However, obtaining large numbers of fine-grained annotated data in this field is a very expensive and difficult task, which hinders the further development of traditional supervised algorithms based on large numbers of annotated data. More recent studies have started to liberate from the traditional supervised paradigm, and the most representative ones are the studies on weakly supervised learning paradigm based on weak annotation, semi-supervised learning paradigm based on limited annotation, and self-supervised learning paradigm based on pathological image representation learning. These new methods have led a new wave of automatic pathological image diagnosis and analysis targeted at annotation efficiency. With a survey of over 130 papers, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of the latest studies on weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning in the field of computational pathology from both technical and methodological perspectives. Finally, we present the key challenges and future trends for these techniques.",

Multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector regression (SVR), decision trees (DT), extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) and multi-layer neural networks (MLNN) are used for prediction. Results reveal that MLR, KNN, and SVR provide high root mean square error (RMSE) and low R2values. Meanwhile, more complex algorithms, such as DT and especially XGBoost, derive higher accuracy with a 0.73 R2value. Therefore, using advanced machine learning algorithms, we may predict cash holdings considerably.",

        "abstract": "<p>In remote sensing, plenty of multi-spectral images are publicly available from various landcover satellite missions. Contrastive self-supervised learning is commonly applied to unlabeled data but relies on domain-specific transformations used for learning. When focusing on vegetation, standard transformations from image processing cannot be applied to the NIR channel, which carries valuable information about the vegetation state. Therefore, we use contrastive learning, relying on different views of unlabelled, multi-spectral images to obtain a pre-trained model to improve the accuracy scores on small-sized remote sensing datasets. This study presents the generation of additional views tailored to remote sensing images using atmospheric correction as an alternative transformation to color jittering. The purpose of the atmospheric transformation is to provide a physically consistent transformation. The proposed transformation can be easily integrated with multiple channels to exploit spectral signatures of objects. Our approach can be applied to other remote sensing tasks. Using this transformation leads to improved classification accuracy of up to 6%.</p>",

There are multiple fatal diseases which grow rapidly all over the world pancreatitis is one among them. Medical professionals want a reliable prediction system to diagnose Pancreatitis. Getting useful information out of the data which has been examined using diverse perspective and various machine learning methods and grouping the required information is a bit difficult task. When various data mining methods are applied on a huge and accessible data which will definitely provide us with the required information to the users. Pancreatitis contributes to Infection, Kidney failure, Breathing problem, Diabetes, Malnutrition, Pancreatic cancer. So, mining the Pancreatitis data in efficient way is a crucial concern. An outcome feature has to be predicted using a dataset where the outcome may contain only two constants that is either 1 or 0. 0 refers to the sufferer having Acute Pancreatitis and 1 refers to the sufferer may have chronic pancreatitis. Thus, an outcome feature with exemplary accuracy has to be predicted using the test dataset and classification algorithms. In order to realize this data is very necessary and then diverse classification techniques can be experimented. Then a finest model can be preferred which gives the maximum accuracy among all others.",

Both people and businesses have been victimized by ransomware, costing the victims millions of dollars in ransom payments. In addition, victims who were unable to pay the ransom or decrypt the data experienced data losses. This study uses dynamic malware analysis artifacts and supervised machine learning to detect ransomware at the host level. It takes on a thorough examination of the operational specifics of ransomware and suggests a supervised machine-learning approach to detection using various ransomware features derived from dynamic malware analysis. According to the findings, a Logistic Regression algorithm model with a 97.7% accuracy score offers a 99% success rate in ransomware detection. This demonstrates how well machine learning and dynamic malware analysis work together to detect ransomware activity at the host level. Systems security administrators can mitigate security risks by using this method.",

However, due to technical limitations of the existing sequencing technologies, low gene expression values are often omitted, leading to inaccurate gene counts. The available methods, including state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, are incapable of imputing the gene expressions reliably because of the lack of a mechanism to explicitly consider the underlying biological knowledge of the system. Here we tackle the problem in two steps to exploit the gene-gene interactions of the system: (i) we reposition the genes in such a way that their spatial configuration reflects their interactive relationships; and (ii) we use a self-supervised 2D convolutional neural network to extract the contextual features of the interactions from the spatially configured genes and impute the omitted values. Extensive experiments with both simulated and experimental scRNA-seq datasets are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy against the existing imputation methods.",

        "abstract": "X-ray μCT imaging is a common technique that is used to gain access to the full-field characterization of materials. Nevertheless, the process can be expensive and time-consuming, thus limiting image availability. A number of existing generative models can assist in mitigating this limitation, but they often lack a sound physical basis. This work presents a physics-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs) model and applies it to the generation of X-ray μCT images. FEM simulations provide physical information in the form of elastic coefficients. Negative X-ray μCT images of a Hostun sand were used as the target material. During training, image batches were evaluated with nonparametric statistics to provide posterior metrics. A variety of loss functions and FEM evaluation frequencies were tested in a parametric study. The results show, that in several test scenarios, FEM-GANs-generated images proved to be better than the reference images for most of the elasticity coefficients. Although the model failed at perfectly reproducing the three out-of-axis coefficients in most cases, the model showed a net improvement with respect to the GANs reference. The generated images can be used in data augmentation, the calibration of image analysis tools, filling incomplete X-ray μCT images, and generating microscale variability in multiscale applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study presents an artificial neural network based model that can simultaneously estimate land suitability for barley, peas, spring wheat, canola, oats, and soy in Canada leading to more accurate predictions than single-crop models. The novelties in the modelling method include using an indicator function which allows for a multivariate model to be trained, and a semi-supervised learning approach which allows for training with unlabelled data. The model performs well on land not used in the training set, as demonstrated by both K-fold cross-validation and a visual comparison of crop inventory to predicted land suitability in northern Alberta. The predicted suitability of crops correspond with a region's growing season length; this is in line with literature. Northern Canada is almost completely unused for agriculture, but this may change in the coming decades due to the climate becoming more favorable for agriculture. The model presented in this work can allow for a precise cost benefit analysis regarding environmental damage and economic benefits of cultivating new lands in Canada.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories spread through many parts of society. However, the disinformation spreading through social media is, according to the literature, one of the causes of increased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In this context, the analysis of social media posts is particularly important, but the large amount of data exchanged on social media platforms requires specific methods. This is why machine learning and natural language processing models are increasingly applied to social media data.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study is to examine the capability of the CamemBERT French-language model to faithfully predict the elaborated categories, with the knowledge that tweets about vaccination are often ambiguous, sarcastic, or irrelevant to the studied topic.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 901,908 unique French-language tweets related to vaccination published between July 12, 2021, and August 11, 2021, were extracted using Twitter’s application programming interface (version 2; Twitter Inc). Approximately 2000 randomly selected tweets were labeled with 2 types of categorizations: (1) arguments for (pros) or against (cons) vaccination (health measures included) and (2) type of content (scientific, political, social, or vaccination status). The CamemBERT model was fine-tuned and tested for the classification of French-language tweets. The model’s performance was assessed by computing the F1-score, and confusion matrices were obtained.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe accuracy of the applied machine learning reached up to 70.6% for the first classification (pro and con tweets) and up to 90% for the second classification (scientific and political tweets). Furthermore, a tweet was 1.86 times more likely to be incorrectly classified by the model if it contained fewer than 170 characters (odds ratio 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.86).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe accuracy of the model is affected by the classification chosen and the topic of the message examined. When the vaccine debate is jostled by contested political decisions, tweet content becomes so heterogeneous that the accuracy of the model drops for less differentiated classes. However, our tests showed that it is possible to improve the accuracy by selecting tweets using a new method based on tweet length.\n",

        "abstract": "Although its origins date a few decades back, contrastive learning has recently gained popularity due to its achievements in self-supervised learning, especially in computer vision. Supervised learning usually requires a decent amount of labeled data, which is not easy to obtain for many applications. With self-supervised learning, we can use inexpensive unlabeled data and achieve a training on a pretext task. Such a training helps us to learn powerful representations. In most cases, for a downstream task, self-supervised training is fine-tuned with the available amount of labeled data. In this study, we review common pretext and downstream tasks in computer vision and we present the latest self-supervised contrastive learning techniques, which are implemented as Siamese neural networks. Lastly, we present a case study where self-supervised contrastive learning was applied to learn representations of semantic masks of images. Performance was evaluated on an image retrieval task and results reveal that, in accordance with the findings in the literature, fine-tuning the self-supervised training showed the best performance.",

        "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have achieved promising performance in attributed graph clustering and semi-supervised node classification because it is capable of modeling complex graphical structure, and jointly learning both features and relations of nodes. Inspired by the success of unsupervised learning in the training of deep models, we wonder whether graph-based unsupervised learning can collaboratively boost the performance of semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a multi-task graph learning model, called collaborative graph convolutional networks (CGCN). CGCN is composed of an attributed graph clustering network and a semi-supervised node classification network. As Gaussian mixture models can effectively discover the inherent complex data distributions, a new end to end attributed graph clustering network is designed by combining variational graph auto-encoder with Gaussian mixture models (GMM-VGAE) rather than the classic k-means. If the pseudo-label of an unlabeled sample assigned by GMM-VGAE is consistent with the prediction of the semi-supervised GCN, it is selected to further boost the performance of semi-supervised learning with the help of the pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark graph datasets validate the superiority of our proposed GMM-VGAE compared with the state-of-the-art attributed graph clustering networks. The performance of node classification is greatly improved by our proposed CGCN, which verifies graph-based unsupervised learning can be well exploited to enhance the performance of semi-supervised learning.",

The inference accuracies of these methods depend greatly on whether or not the model can be well fitted to the data, and therefore we are required to select an appropriate regression model, which is difficult in practice. This paper proposes a supervised learning framework that utilizes a classifier instead of regression models. We present a feature representation that employs the distance between the conditional distributions given past variable values and show experimentally that the feature representation provides sufficiently different feature vectors for time series with different causal relationships. Furthermore, we extend our framework to multivariate time series and present experimental results where our method outperformed the model-based methods and the supervised learning method for i.i.d. data.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in the realm of landslide detection through the analysis of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery. However, their performance is notably contingent upon the quantity of manual annotations utilized during the training process. This investigation delves into the utilization of two distinct Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, specifically the Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) and Swapping Assignments between multiple Views (SwAV). These models were adapted and enhanced for downstream tasks, particularly in the domain of landslide detection. To train the SSL models, the Landslide4Sense competition dataset was employed, consisting of 3799 training patches, 245 validation patches, and 800 testing patches generated from Sentinel-2 images acquired from diverse regions worldwide. During the training of SimCLR and SwAV models, only the training patches were utilized, with a series of data augmentations applied to the input dataset based on each model's architecture. Both models employed ResNet-50 as the encoder.\nFor the downstream task of landslide detection, a custom U-Net model was developed. The trained ResNet-50 served as the encoder, and during fine-tuning, only the decoder part was permitted to be trained while the encoder remained frozen. During the fine-tuning process, subsets comprising 1% and 10% of labeled data from the training dataset were randomly selected to train the model, and predictions were exclusively conducted on the testing data. While a conventional supervised ResU-Net model, which was trained on all labeled training datasets, attained an F1 score of 72%, the SSL models achieved F1 scores of 64% and 71% with 1% labeled data, and 68% and 76% with 10% labeled data for SimCLR and SwAV, respectively. In addition, comparisons were conducted with all supervised reference models in the Landslide4Sense competition, revealing that SwAV, with 10% labeled data, outperformed all models, surpassing their top model by 4%. This study underscores the potential of SSL techniques in the segmentation and classification of RS images for natural hazard mapping, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is not available or is limited.",

Deciphering the information stored in BCR sequence datasets will transform our fundamental understanding of disease and enable discovery of novel diagnostics and antibody therapeutics. One of the grand challenges of BCR sequence analysis is the prediction of BCR properties from their amino acid sequence alone. Here we present an antibody-specific language model, AntiBERTa, which provides a contextualised representation of BCR sequences. Following pre-training, we show that AntiBERTa embeddings learn biologically relevant information, generalizable to a range of applications. As a case study, we demonstrate how AntiBERTa can be fine-tuned to predict paratope positions from an antibody sequence, outperforming public tools across multiple metrics. To our knowledge, AntiBERTa is the deepest protein family-specific language model, providing a rich representation of BCRs. AntiBERTa embeddings are primed for multiple downstream tasks and can improve our understanding of the language of antibodies.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nChest X-ray imaging based abnormality localization, essential in diagnosing various diseases, faces significant clinical challenges due to complex interpretations and the growing workload of radiologists. Recent advances in deep learning, especially self-supervised learning, offer promising solutions to enhance image analysis efficiency, accuracy and reliability.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to improve autonomic abnormality localization performance of chest X-ray image analysis, particularly in detecting abnormalities, using a self-supervised learning method called BarlowTwins-CXR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe utilized two publicly available datasets: the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and the VinDr-CXR. The BarlowTwins-CXR approach was conducted in a two-stage training process. Initially, self-supervised pre-training was performed using an adjusted Barlow Twins algorithm on the NIH dataset with a Resnet50 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. This was followed by supervised fine-tuning on the VinDr-CXR dataset using Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The study employed mean Average Precision (mAP) at an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 50% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for performance evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur experiments showed a significant improvement in model performance with BarlowTwins-CXR. The approach achieved a 3% increase in mAP50 accuracy compared to traditional ImageNet pre-trained models. In addition, the Ablation CAM method revealed enhanced precision in localizing chest abnormalities. The study involved 112,120 images from the NIH dataset and 18,000 images from the VinDr-CXR dataset, indicating robust training and testing samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBarlowTwins-CXR significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of chest X-ray image base abnormality localization, outperforming traditional transfer learning methods. Its ability to adapt to various imaging conditions and regional variations demonstrates the potential of self-supervised learning in medical diagnostics. This approach can be instrumental in aiding radiologists, particularly in high-workload environments, offering a promising direction for future AI-driven healthcare solutions.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractMany biological problems are understudied due to experimental limitations and human biases. Although deep learning is promising in accelerating scientific discovery, its power compromises when applied to problems with scarcely labeled data and data distribution shifts. We developed a semi-supervised meta learning framework Meta Model Agnostic Pseudo Label Learning (MMAPLE) to address these challenges by effectively exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) unlabeled data when transfer learning fails. The power of MMAPLE is demonstrated in multiple applications: predicting OOD drug-target interactions, hidden human metabolite-enzyme interactions, and understudied interspecies microbiome metabolite-human receptor interactions, where chemicals or proteins in unseen data are dramatically different from those in training data. MMAPLE achieves 11% to 242% improvement in the prediction-recall on multiple OOD benchmarks over baseline models. Using MMAPLE, we reveal novel interspecies metaboliteprotein interactions that are validated by bioactivity assays and fill in missing links in microbiome-human interactions. MMAPLE is a general framework to explore previously unrecognized biological domains beyond the reach of present experimental and computational techniques.",

        "abstract": "The increased complexity and intelligence of automation systems require the development of intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) methodologies. By relying on the concept of a suspected space, this study develops explainable data-driven IFD approaches for nonlinear dynamic systems. More in detail, we parameterize nonlinear systems through a generalized kernel representation used for system modeling and the associated fault diagnosis. An important result obtained is a unified form of kernel representations, applicable to both unsupervised and supervised learning. More importantly, through a rigorous theoretical analysis we discover the existence of \\emph{a bridge} (i.e., a bijective mapping) between some supervised and unsupervised learning-based entities. Notably, the designed IFD approaches achieve the same performance by the use of this bridge. In order to have a better understanding of the results obtained, unsupervised and supervised neural networks are chosen as the learning tools to identify generalized kernel representations and design the IFD schemes; an invertible neural network is then employed to build the bridge between them. This study is a perspective article, whose contribution lies in proposing and detailing the fundamental concepts for explainable intelligent learning methods, contributing to system modeling and data-driven IFD designs for nonlinear dynamic systems.",

The case of hate speech detection provides valuable insight into the promises and pitfalls of supervised text classification for sociological analyses. A key theme running through the chapter is that ostensibly minor methodological decisions—particularly those related to the development of training datasets—can have profound downstream impacts. In particular, the chapter examines racial bias in these systems, explaining why models intended to detect hate speech can discriminate against the groups they are designed to protect and discussing efforts to mitigate these problems. It argues that hate speech detection and other forms of content moderation should be an important topic of sociological inquiry as platforms increasingly use these tools to govern speech on a global scale.",

        "abstract": "Due to difficulties in acquiring ground truth depth of equirectangular (360) images, the quality and quantity of equirectangular depth data today is insufficient to represent the various scenes in the world. Therefore, 360 depth estimation studies, which relied solely on supervised learning, are destined to produce unsatisfactory results. Although self-supervised learning methods focusing on equirectangular images (EIs) are introduced, they often have incorrect or non-unique solutions, causing unstable performance. In this paper, we propose 360 monocular depth estimation methods which improve on the areas that limited previous studies. First, we introduce a self-supervised 360 depth learning method that only utilizes gravity-aligned videos, which has the potential to eliminate the needs for depth data during the training procedure. Second, we propose a joint learning scheme realized by combining supervised and self-supervised learning. The weakness of each learning is compensated, thus leading to more accurate depth estimation. Third, we propose a non-local fusion block, which can further retain the global information encoded by vision transformer when reconstructing the depths. With the proposed methods, we successfully apply the transformer to 360 depth estimations, to the best of our knowledge, which has not been tried before. On several benchmarks, our approach achieves significant improvements over previous works and establishes a state of the art.",

However, learning models for these tasks is difficult partly because generating the necessary supervision signals for it is costly and does not scale. This paper describes several learning paradigms that are designed to alleviate the supervision bottleneck. It will illustrate their benefit in the context of multiple problems, all pertaining to inducing various levels of semantic representations from text. In particular, we discuss  (i) esponse Driven Learning of models, a learning protocol that supports inducing meaning representations simply by observing the model's behavior in its environment, (ii) the exploitation of Incidental Supervision signals that exist in the data, independently of the task at hand, to learn models that identify and classify semantic predicates, and (iii) the use of weak supervision to combine simple models to support global decisions where joint supervision is not available.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSupervised comparative learning makes the spatial features of similar samples close to each other by category information. However, currently supervised contrast learning relies more on the spatial feature representation of the original data, which lacks enough intra-class variation to obtain good results when training data is lacking. A supervised comparative learning text classification model based on two-layer data augmentation(TDACL) has been presented to improve intra-class diversity and gain better feature representation, which serves the text classification task.TDACL first improves intra-class diversity using keyword-based data augmentation in the input layer and interpolated data augmentation in the hidden layer.Afterward, a compact intra-class feature space is learned using contrast loss. Experiments in low-resource environments show that our approach is more effective in improving the performance of the model when training data is scarce. We conducted experiments on four different datasets, SST-2, CR, TREC, and PC, achieving 92.10%, 92.54%, 97.61%, and 95.27% accuracy, respectively, outperforming the robust baseline approach.",

        "abstract": "<p>In remote sensing, plenty of multi-spectral images are publicly available from various landcover satellite missions. Contrastive self-supervised learning is commonly applied to unlabeled data but relies on domain-specific transformations used for learning. When focusing on vegetation, standard transformations from image processing cannot be applied to the NIR channel, which carries valuable information about the vegetation state. Therefore, we use contrastive learning, relying on different views of unlabelled, multi-spectral images to obtain a pre-trained model to improve the accuracy scores on small-sized remote sensing datasets. This study presents the generation of additional views tailored to remote sensing images using atmospheric correction as an alternative transformation to color jittering. The purpose of the atmospheric transformation is to provide a physically consistent transformation. The proposed transformation can be easily integrated with multiple channels to exploit spectral signatures of objects. Our approach can be applied to other remote sensing tasks. Using this transformation leads to improved classification accuracy of up to 6%.</p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning algorithms hold the promise of greatly improving live cell image analysis by way of (1) analyzing far more imagery than can be achieved by more traditional manual approaches and (2) by eliminating the subjective nature of researchers and diagnosticians selecting the cells or cell features to be included in the analyzed data set. Currently, however, even the most sophisticated model based or machine learning algorithms require user supervision, meaning the subjectivity problem is not removed but rather incorporated into the algorithm’s initial training steps and then repeatedly applied to the imagery. To address this roadblock, we have developed a self-supervised machine learning algorithm that recursively trains itself directly from the live cell imagery data, thus providing objective segmentation and quantification. The approach incorporates an optical flow algorithm component to self-label cell and background pixels for training, followed by the extraction of additional feature vectors for the automated generation of a cell/background classification model. Because it is self-trained, the software has no user-adjustable parameters and does not require curated training imagery.  The algorithm was applied to automatically segment cells from their background for a variety of cell types and five commonly used imaging modalities - fluorescence, phase contrast, differential interference contrast (DIC), transmitted light and interference reflection microscopy (IRM).  The approach is broadly applicable in that it enables completely automated cell segmentation for long-term live cell phenotyping applications, regardless of the input imagery’s optical modality, magnification or cell type.",

        "abstract": "The Max-cut problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, which has many real-world applications. However, the problem has been proven to be non-deterministic polynomial-hard (NP-hard), which means that exact solution algorithms are not suitable for large-scale situations, as it is too time-consuming to obtain a solution. Therefore, designing heuristic algorithms is a promising but challenging direction to effectively solve large-scale Max-cut problems. For this reason, we propose a unique method which combines a pointer network and two deep learning strategies (supervised learning and reinforcement learning) in this paper, in order to address this challenge. A pointer network is a sequence-to-sequence deep neural network, which can extract data features in a purely data-driven way to discover the hidden laws behind data. Combining the characteristics of the Max-cut problem, we designed the input and output mechanisms of the pointer network model, and we used supervised learning and reinforcement learning to train the model to evaluate the model performance. Through experiments, we illustrated that our model can be well applied to solve large-scale Max-cut problems. Our experimental results also revealed that the new method will further encourage broader exploration of deep neural network for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHistopathological images contain abundant phenotypic information and pathological patterns, which are the gold standards for disease diagnosis and essential for the prediction of patient prognosis and treatment outcome. In recent years, computer-automated analysis techniques for histopathological images have been urgently required in clinical practice, and deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural networks have gradually become the mainstream in the field of digital pathology. However, obtaining large numbers of fine-grained annotated data in this field is a very expensive and difficult task, which hinders the further development of traditional supervised algorithms based on large numbers of annotated data. More recent studies have started to liberate from the traditional supervised paradigm, and the most representative ones are the studies on weakly supervised learning paradigm based on weak annotation, semi-supervised learning paradigm based on limited annotation, and self-supervised learning paradigm based on pathological image representation learning. These new methods have led a new wave of automatic pathological image diagnosis and analysis targeted at annotation efficiency. With a survey of over 130 papers, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of the latest studies on weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning in the field of computational pathology from both technical and methodological perspectives. Finally, we present the key challenges and future trends for these techniques.",

        "abstract": "Causal inference in time series is an important problem in many fields. Traditional methods use regression models for this problem. The inference accuracies of these methods depend greatly on whether or not the model can be well fitted to the data, and therefore we are required to select an appropriate regression model, which is difficult in practice. This paper proposes a supervised learning framework that utilizes a classifier instead of regression models. We present a feature representation that employs the distance between the conditional distributions given past variable values and show experimentally that the feature representation provides sufficiently different feature vectors for time series with different causal relationships. Furthermore, we extend our framework to multivariate time series and present experimental results where our method outperformed the model-based methods and the supervised learning method for i.i.d. data.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nChest X-ray imaging based abnormality localization, essential in diagnosing various diseases, faces significant clinical challenges due to complex interpretations and the growing workload of radiologists. Recent advances in deep learning, especially self-supervised learning, offer promising solutions to enhance image analysis efficiency, accuracy and reliability.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to improve autonomic abnormality localization performance of chest X-ray image analysis, particularly in detecting abnormalities, using a self-supervised learning method called BarlowTwins-CXR.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe utilized two publicly available datasets: the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and the VinDr-CXR. The BarlowTwins-CXR approach was conducted in a two-stage training process. Initially, self-supervised pre-training was performed using an adjusted Barlow Twins algorithm on the NIH dataset with a Resnet50 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. This was followed by supervised fine-tuning on the VinDr-CXR dataset using Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). The study employed mean Average Precision (mAP) at an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 50% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for performance evaluation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur experiments showed a significant improvement in model performance with BarlowTwins-CXR. The approach achieved a 3% increase in mAP50 accuracy compared to traditional ImageNet pre-trained models. In addition, the Ablation CAM method revealed enhanced precision in localizing chest abnormalities. The study involved 112,120 images from the NIH dataset and 18,000 images from the VinDr-CXR dataset, indicating robust training and testing samples.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBarlowTwins-CXR significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of chest X-ray image base abnormality localization, outperforming traditional transfer learning methods. Its ability to adapt to various imaging conditions and regional variations demonstrates the potential of self-supervised learning in medical diagnostics. This approach can be instrumental in aiding radiologists, particularly in high-workload environments, offering a promising direction for future AI-driven healthcare solutions.\n",

Deciphering the information stored in BCR sequence datasets will transform our fundamental understanding of disease and enable discovery of novel diagnostics and antibody therapeutics. One of the grand challenges of BCR sequence analysis is the prediction of BCR properties from their amino acid sequence alone. Here we present an antibody-specific language model, AntiBERTa, which provides a contextualised representation of BCR sequences. Following pre-training, we show that AntiBERTa embeddings learn biologically relevant information, generalizable to a range of applications. As a case study, we demonstrate how AntiBERTa can be fine-tuned to predict paratope positions from an antibody sequence, outperforming public tools across multiple metrics. To our knowledge, AntiBERTa is the deepest protein family-specific language model, providing a rich representation of BCRs. AntiBERTa embeddings are primed for multiple downstream tasks and can improve our understanding of the language of antibodies.",

By relying on the concept of a suspected space, this study develops explainable data-driven IFD approaches for nonlinear dynamic systems. More in detail, we parameterize nonlinear systems through a generalized kernel representation used for system modeling and the associated fault diagnosis. An important result obtained is a unified form of kernel representations, applicable to both unsupervised and supervised learning. More importantly, through a rigorous theoretical analysis we discover the existence of \\emph{a bridge} (i.e., a bijective mapping) between some supervised and unsupervised learning-based entities. Notably, the designed IFD approaches achieve the same performance by the use of this bridge. In order to have a better understanding of the results obtained, unsupervised and supervised neural networks are chosen as the learning tools to identify generalized kernel representations and design the IFD schemes; an invertible neural network is then employed to build the bridge between them. This study is a perspective article, whose contribution lies in proposing and detailing the fundamental concepts for explainable intelligent learning methods, contributing to system modeling and data-driven IFD designs for nonlinear dynamic systems.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated superior efficacy compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in the realm of landslide detection through the analysis of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery. However, their performance is notably contingent upon the quantity of manual annotations utilized during the training process. This investigation delves into the utilization of two distinct Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, specifically the Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations (SimCLR) and Swapping Assignments between multiple Views (SwAV). These models were adapted and enhanced for downstream tasks, particularly in the domain of landslide detection. To train the SSL models, the Landslide4Sense competition dataset was employed, consisting of 3799 training patches, 245 validation patches, and 800 testing patches generated from Sentinel-2 images acquired from diverse regions worldwide. During the training of SimCLR and SwAV models, only the training patches were utilized, with a series of data augmentations applied to the input dataset based on each model's architecture. Both models employed ResNet-50 as the encoder.\nFor the downstream task of landslide detection, a custom U-Net model was developed. The trained ResNet-50 served as the encoder, and during fine-tuning, only the decoder part was permitted to be trained while the encoder remained frozen. During the fine-tuning process, subsets comprising 1% and 10% of labeled data from the training dataset were randomly selected to train the model, and predictions were exclusively conducted on the testing data. While a conventional supervised ResU-Net model, which was trained on all labeled training datasets, attained an F1 score of 72%, the SSL models achieved F1 scores of 64% and 71% with 1% labeled data, and 68% and 76% with 10% labeled data for SimCLR and SwAV, respectively. In addition, comparisons were conducted with all supervised reference models in the Landslide4Sense competition, revealing that SwAV, with 10% labeled data, outperformed all models, surpassing their top model by 4%. This study underscores the potential of SSL techniques in the segmentation and classification of RS images for natural hazard mapping, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is not available or is limited.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMany biological problems are understudied due to experimental limitations and human biases. Although deep learning is promising in accelerating scientific discovery, its power compromises when applied to problems with scarcely labeled data and data distribution shifts. We developed a semi-supervised meta learning framework Meta Model Agnostic Pseudo Label Learning (MMAPLE) to address these challenges by effectively exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) unlabeled data when transfer learning fails. The power of MMAPLE is demonstrated in multiple applications: predicting OOD drug-target interactions, hidden human metabolite-enzyme interactions, and understudied interspecies microbiome metabolite-human receptor interactions, where chemicals or proteins in unseen data are dramatically different from those in training data. MMAPLE achieves 11% to 242% improvement in the prediction-recall on multiple OOD benchmarks over baseline models. Using MMAPLE, we reveal novel interspecies metaboliteprotein interactions that are validated by bioactivity assays and fill in missing links in microbiome-human interactions. MMAPLE is a general framework to explore previously unrecognized biological domains beyond the reach of present experimental and computational techniques.",

The case of hate speech detection provides valuable insight into the promises and pitfalls of supervised text classification for sociological analyses. A key theme running through the chapter is that ostensibly minor methodological decisions—particularly those related to the development of training datasets—can have profound downstream impacts. In particular, the chapter examines racial bias in these systems, explaining why models intended to detect hate speech can discriminate against the groups they are designed to protect and discussing efforts to mitigate these problems. It argues that hate speech detection and other forms of content moderation should be an important topic of sociological inquiry as platforms increasingly use these tools to govern speech on a global scale.",

        "abstract": "For high-dimensional data such as images, learning an encoder that can output a compact yet informative representation is a key task on its own, in addition to facilitating subsequent processing of data. We present a model that produces discrete infomax codes (DIMCO); we train a probabilistic encoder that yields k-way d-dimensional codes associated with input data. Our model maximizes the mutual information between codes and ground-truth class labels, with a regularization which encourages entries of a codeword to be statistically independent. In this context, we show that the infomax principle also justifies existing loss functions, such as cross-entropy as its special cases. Our analysis also shows that using shorter codes reduces overfitting in the context of few-shot classification, and our various experiments show this implicit task-level regularization effect of DIMCO. Furthermore, we show that the codes learned by DIMCO are efficient in terms of both memory and retrieval time compared to prior methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSite characterization and monitoring of the subsurface formations around wind turbine locations are crucial for reliable wind farm construction, operation and maintenance. In order to extract relevant information about subsurface soils, ultrahigh-resolution (UHR) seismic survey and geotechnical cone- penetration testing (CPT) is often acquired, processed, interpreted and integrated, which could be repeated over time for site monitoring purposes. Due to the size of the area to be investigated and the manual efforts to complete multiple steps in the traditional workflow, the turnaround time for soil property estimation in a wind farm site can be quite long. In this study we implement a semi-supervised learning workflow to automate the task, which integrates URH seismic and CPT logs through two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with one for seismic denoising and feature engineering (SDFE) and the other for seismic-CPT integration (SCI), which reduces the difficulties in CNN training due to poor data quality and small data quantity. The two components are connected by implementing the encoder of the pretrained SDFE-CNN as part of the SCI-CNN encoder. As tested on a public wind farm site, the use of deep learning leads to promising results in terms of both quality and efficiency. The proposed workflow is also extensible to include additional information, such as structure and velocity models, for further constraining the SCI-CNN.\nHighlights: A semi-supervised learning workflow is proposed for soil property estimation from UHR seismic and CPT tests in a wind farm site,allows estimating the essential soil properties such as cone-tip resistance from post-stack UHR seismic as tested on a real windfarm site HKZ, andreduces the turnaround time of windfarm site characterization compared to traditional workflows.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe relationship between the genotype, the genetic instructions encoded into a genome, and phenotype, the macroscopic realization of such instructions, remains mostly uncharted. In addition, tools able to uncover the connection between the phenotype with a specific set of responsible genes are still under definition. In this work, we focus on yeast organelles called vacuoles, which are cell membrane compartments that vary size and shape in response to various stimuli, and we develop a framework relating changes of cellular morphology to genetic modification. The method is a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and an unsupervised learning pipeline, which employs a deep-learning based segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection algorithm. From the live 3D fluorescence vacuole images, we observe that different genetic mutations generate distinct vacuole phenotypes and that the same mutation might correspond to more than one vacuole morphology. We trained a Unet architecture to segment our cellular images and obtain precise, quantitative information in 2D depth-encoded images. We then used an unsupervised learning approach to cluster the vacuole types and to establish a correlation between genotype and vacuole morphology. Using this procedure, we obtained 4 phenotypic groups. We extracted a set of 131 morphological features from the segmented vacuoles images, reduced to 50 after a tree-based feature selection. We obtained a purity of 85% adopting a Fuzzy K-Means based algorithm on a random subset of 880 images, containing all the detected phenotypic groups. Finally, we trained a CNN on the labels assigned during clustering. The CNN has been used for prediction of a large dataset (6942 images) with high accuracy (80%). Our approach can be applied extensively for live fluorescence image analysis and most importantly can unveil the basic principles relating genotype to vacuole phenotype in yeast cell, which can be thought as a first step for inferring cell designing principles to generate organelles with a specific, desired morphology.",

Image denoising is an important tool for retrieving information from dim live cell images. Recently, deep learning based image denoising is becoming the leading method because of its promising denoising performance, achieved by leveraging available prior knowledge about the noise model and samples at hand. We demonstrate that incorporating temporal information in the model can further improve the results. However, the practical application of this method has seen challenges because of the requirement of large, task-specific training datasets. In this work, addressed this challenge by combining self-supervised learning with transfer learning, which eliminated the demand of task-matched training data while maintaining denoising performance. We demonstrate its application in fluorescent imaging of different subcellular structures.",

In this study, we proposed a methodology to evaluate point-occurrence records based on expert knowledge. We firstly generated virtual data to test our methodology without confounding factors by simulating geographical distributions, virtual sampling, and expert checking of occurrence records. We used a set of non-linear bioclimatic variables and principal component analysis (PCA) to define a duality function between niche and biotope spaces. Subsequently, a supervised-learning model was fit to classify records between true and doubtful presence based on the virtual expert checking. We then tested our methodology using three virtual species and 10-fold cross validation. Also, we evaluated the prediction performance of the supervise model compared with the virtual observer using a virtual external database of occurrence data.",

        "abstract": "Politicians appeal to social groups to court their electoral support and secure their political survival. But quantifying which groups politicians refer to, claim to repre- sent, or address in their public communication presents researchers with challenges. We propose a novel supervised learning approach for identifying group mentions in political texts. We first collect human annotations to determine the exact text pas- sages that refer to social groups. We then fine-tune a Transformer language model for contextualized supervised classification at the word level. Applied to unlabeled texts, our approach enables researchers to detect and extract word spans that contain group mentions automatically. We illustrate the reliability, validity, and flexibility of our ap- proach in a study of British parties’ election manifestos, parliamentary questions, as well as German party manifestos. Our application demonstrates that our method en- ables highly reliable retrieval of group mentions at scale and new quantitative insights into group-based political rhetoric.",

        "abstract": "Due to difficulties in acquiring ground truth depth of equirectangular (360) images, the quality and quantity of equirectangular depth data today is insufficient to represent the various scenes in the world. Therefore, 360 depth estimation studies, which relied solely on supervised learning, are destined to produce unsatisfactory results. Although self-supervised learning methods focusing on equirectangular images (EIs) are introduced, they often have incorrect or non-unique solutions, causing unstable performance. In this paper, we propose 360 monocular depth estimation methods which improve on the areas that limited previous studies. First, we introduce a self-supervised 360 depth learning method that only utilizes gravity-aligned videos, which has the potential to eliminate the needs for depth data during the training procedure. Second, we propose a joint learning scheme realized by combining supervised and self-supervised learning. The weakness of each learning is compensated, thus leading to more accurate depth estimation. Third, we propose a non-local fusion block, which can further retain the global information encoded by vision transformer when reconstructing the depths. With the proposed methods, we successfully apply the transformer to 360 depth estimations, to the best of our knowledge, which has not been tried before. On several benchmarks, our approach achieves significant improvements over previous works and establishes a state of the art.",

However, learning models for these tasks is difficult partly because generating the necessary supervision signals for it is costly and does not scale. This paper describes several learning paradigms that are designed to alleviate the supervision bottleneck. It will illustrate their benefit in the context of multiple problems, all pertaining to inducing various levels of semantic representations from text. In particular, we discuss  (i) esponse Driven Learning of models, a learning protocol that supports inducing meaning representations simply by observing the model's behavior in its environment, (ii) the exploitation of Incidental Supervision signals that exist in the data, independently of the task at hand, to learn models that identify and classify semantic predicates, and (iii) the use of weak supervision to combine simple models to support global decisions where joint supervision is not available.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSupervised comparative learning makes the spatial features of similar samples close to each other by category information. However, currently supervised contrast learning relies more on the spatial feature representation of the original data, which lacks enough intra-class variation to obtain good results when training data is lacking. A supervised comparative learning text classification model based on two-layer data augmentation(TDACL) has been presented to improve intra-class diversity and gain better feature representation, which serves the text classification task.TDACL first improves intra-class diversity using keyword-based data augmentation in the input layer and interpolated data augmentation in the hidden layer.Afterward, a compact intra-class feature space is learned using contrast loss. Experiments in low-resource environments show that our approach is more effective in improving the performance of the model when training data is scarce. We conducted experiments on four different datasets, SST-2, CR, TREC, and PC, achieving 92.10%, 92.54%, 97.61%, and 95.27% accuracy, respectively, outperforming the robust baseline approach.",

        "abstract": "<p>In remote sensing, plenty of multi-spectral images are publicly available from various landcover satellite missions. Contrastive self-supervised learning is commonly applied to unlabeled data but relies on domain-specific transformations used for learning. When focusing on vegetation, standard transformations from image processing cannot be applied to the NIR channel, which carries valuable information about the vegetation state. Therefore, we use contrastive learning, relying on different views of unlabelled, multi-spectral images to obtain a pre-trained model to improve the accuracy scores on small-sized remote sensing datasets. This study presents the generation of additional views tailored to remote sensing images using atmospheric correction as an alternative transformation to color jittering. The purpose of the atmospheric transformation is to provide a physically consistent transformation. The proposed transformation can be easily integrated with multiple channels to exploit spectral signatures of objects. Our approach can be applied to other remote sensing tasks. Using this transformation leads to improved classification accuracy of up to 6%.</p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning algorithms hold the promise of greatly improving live cell image analysis by way of (1) analyzing far more imagery than can be achieved by more traditional manual approaches and (2) by eliminating the subjective nature of researchers and diagnosticians selecting the cells or cell features to be included in the analyzed data set. Currently, however, even the most sophisticated model based or machine learning algorithms require user supervision, meaning the subjectivity problem is not removed but rather incorporated into the algorithm’s initial training steps and then repeatedly applied to the imagery. To address this roadblock, we have developed a self-supervised machine learning algorithm that recursively trains itself directly from the live cell imagery data, thus providing objective segmentation and quantification. The approach incorporates an optical flow algorithm component to self-label cell and background pixels for training, followed by the extraction of additional feature vectors for the automated generation of a cell/background classification model. Because it is self-trained, the software has no user-adjustable parameters and does not require curated training imagery.  The algorithm was applied to automatically segment cells from their background for a variety of cell types and five commonly used imaging modalities - fluorescence, phase contrast, differential interference contrast (DIC), transmitted light and interference reflection microscopy (IRM).  The approach is broadly applicable in that it enables completely automated cell segmentation for long-term live cell phenotyping applications, regardless of the input imagery’s optical modality, magnification or cell type.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nExcited states of molecules lie in the heart of photochemistry and chemical reactions. The recent development in quantum computational chemistry leads to inventions of a variety of algorithms that calculate the excited states of molecules on near-term quantum computers, but they require more computational burdens than the algorithms for calculating the ground states. In this study, we propose a scheme of supervised quantum machine learning which predicts the excited-state properties of molecules only from their ground state wavefunction resulting in reducing the computational cost for calculating the excited states. Our model is comprised of a quantum reservoir and a classical machine learning unit which processes the measurement results of single-qubit Pauli operators with the output state from the reservoir. The quantum reservoir effectively transforms the single-qubit operators into complicated multi-qubit ones which contain essential information of the system, so that the classical machine learning unit may decode them appropriately. The number of runs for quantum computers is saved by training only the classical machine learning unit, and the whole model requires modest resources of quantum hardware that may be implemented in current experiments. We illustrate the predictive ability of our model by numerical simulations for small molecules with and without noise inevitable in near-term quantum computers. The results show that our scheme reproduces well the first and second excitation energies as well as the transition dipole moment between the ground states and excited states only from the ground states as inputs. We expect our contribution will enhance the applications of quantum computers in the study of quantum chemistry and quantum materials.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDifferent types of microscopy are used to uncover signatures of cell adhesion and mechanics. Automating the identification and analysis often involve sacrificial routines of cell manipulation such as in vitro staining. Phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) is rarely used in automation due to the difficulties with poor quality images. However, it is the least intrusive method to provide insights into the dynamics of cells, where other types of microscopy are too destructive to monitor. In this study, we propose an efficient workflow to automate cell counting and morphology in PCM images. We introduce Cell Adhesion with Supervised Training and Learning Environment (CASTLE), available as a series of additional plugins to ImageJ. CASTLE combines effective techniques for phase-contrast image processing with statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to interpret the results. The proposed workflow was validated by comparing the results to a manual count and manual segmentation of cells in images investigating different adherent cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. In addition, the effect of different molecules on cell adhesion was characterised using CASTLE. For example, we demonstate that Galectin-9 leads to differences in adhesion of leukocytes. CASTLE also provides information using machine learning techniques, namely principal component analysis and k-means clustering, to distinguish morphology currently inaccessible with manual methods. All scripts and documentation is open-source and available at the corresponding GitLab project.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPatent data provides rich information about technical inventions, but does not disclose the ethnic origin of inventors. In this article, I use supervised learning techniques to infer this information. To do so, I construct a dataset of 96′777 labeled names and train an artificial recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict ethnic origins based on names. The trained network achieves an overall performance of 91.4% across 18 ethnic origins. I use this model to predict and investigate the ethnic origins of 2.68 million inventors and provide novel descriptive evidence regarding their ethnic origin composition over time and across countries and technological fields. The global ethnic origin composition has become more diverse over the last decades, which was mostly due to a relative increase of Asian origin inventors. Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-Western inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other high-income countries.",

        "abstract": "In semi-supervised label propagation (LP), the data manifold is approximated by a graph, which is considered as a similarity metric. Graph estimation is a crucial task, as it affects the further processes applied on the graph (e.g., LP, classification). As our knowledge of data is limited, a single approximation cannot easily find the appropriate graph, so in line with this, multiple graphs are constructed. Recently, multi-metric fusion techniques have been used to construct more accurate graphs which better represent the data manifold and, hence, improve the performance of LP. However, most of these algorithms disregard use of the information of label space in the LP process. In this article, we propose a new multi-metric graph-fusion method, based on the Flexible Manifold Embedding algorithm. Our proposed method represents a unified framework that merges two phases: graph fusion and LP. Based on one available view, different simple graphs were efficiently generated and used as input to our proposed fusion approach. Moreover, our method incorporated the label space information as a new form of graph, namely the Correlation Graph, with other similarity graphs. Furthermore, it updated the correlation graph to find a better representation of the data manifold. Our experimental results on four face datasets in face recognition demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy image classification is an image classification task that predicts whether colonoscopy images contain polyps or not. It is an important task input for an automatic polyp detection system. Recently, deep neural networks have been widely used for colonoscopy image classification due to the automatic feature extraction with high accuracy. However, training these networks requires a large amount of manually annotated data, which is expensive to acquire and limited by the available resources of endoscopy specialists. We propose a novel method for training colonoscopy image classification networks by using self-supervised visual feature learning to overcome this challenge. We adapt image denoising as a pretext task for self-supervised visual feature learning from unlabeled colonoscopy image dataset, where noise is added to the image for input, and the original image serves as the label. We use an unlabeled colonoscopy image dataset containing 8,500 images collected from the PACS system of Hospital 103 to train the pretext network. The feature exactor of the pretext network trained in a self-supervised way is used for colonoscopy image classification. A small labeled dataset from the public colonoscopy image dataset Kvasir is used to fine-tune the classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised learning method can achieve a high colonoscopy image classification accuracy better than the classifier trained from scratch, especially at a small training dataset. When a dataset with only annotated 200 images is used for training classifiers, the proposed method improves accuracy from 72,16% to 93,15% compared to the baseline classifier.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is generally considered an option for benign prostatic diseases especially nodular hyperplasia patients who have moderate to severe urinary problems that have not responded to medication. Importantly, incidental prostate cancer are diagnosed at the time of TUR-P for benign prostatic disease. Since diagnosing a large number of cases containing TUR-P specimens which are characterized by a very large volume of tissue fragments by pathologists using a conventional microscope is time-consuming and limited in terms of human resources. Thus, it is necessary to develop new techniques which can rapidly and accurately screen large numbers of TUR-P specimens. Computational pathology applications which can assist pathologists in detecting prostate adenocarcinoma from TUR-P whole slide images (WSIs) would be of great benefit for routine histopathological workflow. In this study, we trained deep learning models to classify TUR-P WSIs into prostate adenocarcinoma and benign (non-neoplastic) lesions using transfer and weakly supervised learning. We evaluated the models on TUR-P, needle biopsy, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) public dataset test sets, achieving an ROC-AUC up to 0.984 in TUR-P test sets for adenocarcinoma. The results demonstrate the high promising potential of deployment in a practical TUR-P histopathological diagnostic workflow system.",

        "abstract": "One of the most serious ethical challenges in the credit card industry is fraud. Our paper’s major goal is to identify credit card theft and offer a reasonable solution to the problem. Credit card fraud has cost customers and banks billions of dollars around the world. Fraudsters are constantly attempting to come up with new ways and tricks to commit fraud, despite the fact that there are several measures in place to prevent it. Fraud detection is extremely important in the banking and finance industries. For detection purposes, we will use an artificial neural network. As a result, in order to prevent it, we will develop a system that will not only detect fraud, but will also detect it before it occurs. In order to detect new scams, our system will learn from previous frauds. Mining algorithms were used to detect fraud, but they failed miserably. We use machine learning methods to detect fraud in credit card transactions in our paper. The research employs supervised learning methods that are applied to a kaggle dataset that is severely skewed and imbalanced. We used robust scalar to balance the set, resulting in 51 percent non-fraud cases and 49 percent fraud ones. Logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and KNN have all been implemented, with additional learning curves displaying which algorithm performs best.\nAccuracy, specificity, precision, and sensitivity are the evaluation criteria, and a comparative chart is created to show the comparative analysis of various supervised learning algorithms.\nKEYWORDS:  KNN,Neural network,Logistic regression,Random forest,Decision tree",

        "abstract": "AbstractMotivationMetagenomic binning methods to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from environmental samples have been widely used in large-scale metagenomic studies. The recently proposed semi-supervised binning method, SemiBin, achieved state-of-the-art binning results in several environments. However, this required annotating contigs, a computationally costly and potentially biased process.ResultsWe propose SemiBin2, which uses self-supervised learning to learn feature embeddings from the contigs. In simulated and real datasets, we show that self-supervised learning achieves better results than the semi-supervised learning used in SemiBin1 and that SemiBin2 outperforms other state-of-the-art binners. Compared to SemiBin1, SemiBin2 can reconstruct 8.3%–21.5% more high-quality bins and requires only 25% of the running time and 11% of peak memory usage in real short-read sequencing samples. To extend SemiBin2 to long-read data, we also propose ensemble-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm, resulting in 13.1%–26.3% more high-quality genomes than the second best binner for long-read data.Availability and ImplementationSemiBin2 is available as open source software athttps://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/and the analysis scripts used in the study can be found athttps://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin2_benchmark.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.",

Specifically this paper covers the development of a generalizable rig state engine based on the application of supervised machine learning. The same steps used in the creation of the production rig state engine are appled here to a smaller data set to demonstrate both the tractability of the problem and the methods used to create the rig state engine in the production system.\nThe project objective was to provide efficiency and engineering metrics in a central repository covering operated regions. The system is designed to require minimal user configuration and management and provides both historic and near real time analysis to deliver a rich resource for offset comparison and benchmarking.\nIdentifying rig-state is at the heart of every performance and engineering analysis system. This can be thought of as a machine learning classification problem. A large supervised learning set was constructed and used to train classification models which were compared for accuracy. A key success metric was the ability to generalise the selected model across different operations. Output from the rig-state classifier was then used to derive KPI data which was presented through a web based front end. A pilot system was then developed using agile principles allowing for rapid user engagement. Testing demonstrated that the system can support all real time operations within the company simultaneously and rapidly process historic well data for offset benchmarking. The cloud-based architecture allows rapid deployment of the system to new groups significantly reducing deployment costs. The system provides a foundation for onward data science and more advanced functionality.\nMinimal configuration, cloud storage and processing, combining contextual data with real-time rig data, near-real-time and historic analysis capabilities, rapid deployment, low cost, high accuracy and consistent metrics are all key and proven value drivers for the system. The output data is aso a valuable resource for additional machine learning and data science projects.",

        "abstract": "Climbing plants require an external support to grow vertically and enhance light acquisition. Climbers that find a suitable support have greater performance and fitness than those that remain prostrate. Support search is characterized by oscillatory movements (i.e., circumnutation), in which plants rotate around a central axis during their growth. Numerous studies have elucidated the mechanistic details of circumnutation, but how this phenomenon is controlled remains unclear. Here, we use supervised machine learning algorithms to generate models that learn to discriminate between the presence/absence of a support in the environment. Results indicate that there is a difference in the pattern of circumnutation, depending on the presence of a support, that can be learned and classified rather accurately. We also identify distinctive kinematic features that contribute to the classification tasks. Overall, machine learning approaches appear to be powerful tools for understanding the movement of plants.",

Due to the fact that it provides technical explanations and a significant standard, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning has demonstrated that they can better characterize data. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are promising approaches that help in the prediction, diagnosing of sickness. Compared to conventional computing algorithms, deep learning algorithms are far more effective in disease detection and diagnosing. In this study, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are applied to detect the presence of kyphosis in youngsters supported medicine information and compared to point out the rise in the potency of predictions associated with kyphosis. Each classification algorithm that makes use of the hyperparameter tuning and control feature enhances the algorithms' overall prediction performance, which enhances the algorithms' overall performance. The potency of the planned models were enforced and checked over medical dataset utilized from Kaggle. Overall, the DNN model performed best among the wide range of different models and achieved maximum accuracy and other performance metrics scores derived from the stratified K-Fold cross-validation. It is advised that after a patient has completed a clinical procedure, the DNN model be trained to identify and forecast kyphosis disease.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundAssigning every human gene to specific functions, diseases, and traits is a grand challenge in modern genetics. Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods such as supervised-learning and label-propagation that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine learning technique across fields, supervised-learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype-, or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised-learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label-propagation, the widely-benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.ResultsIn this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised-learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a state-of-the-art label-propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised-learning on a gene’s full network connectivity outperforms label-propagation and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label-propagation’s appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised-learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node-embeddings (derived using node2vec), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity.ConclusionThese results show that supervised-learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases, and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows. The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.Contactarjun@msu.edu",

        "abstract": "AbstractConvolutional neural networks trained using supervised learning can improve visual perception for human-robot walking. These advances have been possible due to large-scale datasets like ExoNet and StairNet - the largest open-source image datasets of real-world walking environments. However, these datasets require vast amounts of manually annotated data, the development of which is time consuming and labor intensive. Here we present a novel semi-supervised learning system (ExoNet-SSL) that uses over 1.2 million unlabelled images from ExoNet to improve training efficiency. We developed a deep learning model based on mobile vision transformers and trained the model using semi-supervised learning for image classification. Compared to standard supervised learning (98.4%), our ExoNet-SSL system was able to maintain high prediction accuracy (98.8%) when tested on previously unseen environments, while requiring 35% fewer labelled images during training. These results show that semi-supervised learning can improve training efficiency by leveraging large amounts of unlabelled data and minimize the size requirements for manually annotated images. Future research will focus on model deployment for onboard real-time inference and control of human-robot walking.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhile cases of uveal melanoma are relatively rare overall, it remains the most common intraocular cancer in adults and has a 10-year fatality rate of approximately 50% in metastatic patients with no effective treatment options. Mutations in BAP1, a tumor suppressor gene, have been previously found to be associated with the onset of metastasis in uveal melanoma patients. In this study, I utilize a weakly supervised deep learning-based pipeline in order to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) of uveal melanoma patients in conjunction with slide-level labels regarding the presence of BAP1 mutations. I demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between BAP1 mutations and physical tumor development in uveal melanoma and that my model is able to predict such relationships with an optimized mean test AUC of 0.86. My findings demonstrate that deep learning models are able to accurately predict patient-specific genotypic characteristics in uveal melanoma. Once integrated into and adapted to existing non-invasive ocular scanner technologies, my model would assist healthcare professionals in understanding the specific genetic profiles of their patients and provide more personalized treatment options in a safe, efficient manner, thus resulting in improved treatment outcomes.",

The polarity may be positive, negative or neutral. It is observed that very often the data associated with the sentiment analysis consist of the feedback given by various specialists on any topic or product. Thus, the review may be categorized properly into any sort of class based on the polarity, in order to have a good knowledge about the product. This article proposes an approach to classify the review dataset made on basis of sentiment analysis into different polarity groups. Four machine learning algorithms viz., Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have been considered in this paper for classification process. The obtained result on values of accuracy of the algorithms are critically examined by using different performance parameters, applied on two different datasets. ",

        "abstract": "AbstractWord sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important step in biomedical text mining, which is responsible for assigning an unequivocal concept to an ambiguous term, improving the accuracy of biomedical information extraction systems. In this work we followed supervised and knowledge-based disambiguation approaches, with the best results obtained by supervised means. In the supervised method we used bag-of-words as local features, and word embeddings as global features. In the knowledge-based method we combined word embeddings, concept textual definitions extracted from the UMLS database, and concept association values calculated from the MeSH co-occurrence counts from MEDLINE articles. Also, in the knowledge-based method, we tested different word embedding averaging functions to calculate the surrounding context vectors, with the goal to give more importance to closest words of the ambiguous term. The MSH WSD dataset, the most common dataset used for evaluating biomedical concept disambiguation, was used to evaluate our methods. We obtained a top accuracy of 95.6 % by supervised means, while the best knowledge-based accuracy was 87.4 %. Our results show that word embedding models improved the disambiguation accuracy, proving to be a powerful resource in the WSD task.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRisk and uncertainty play a vital role in almost every significant economic decision, and an individual's propensity to make riskier decisions also depends on various circumstances. Studies on general and financial risk preference mostly kept their investigation restricted to analyzing the correlation between the sociodemographic and economic aspects of risk-taking, using ordinary least-square and supervised machine learning paradigms. This article aims to investigate the effects of social and economic covariates on an individual's willingness to take general risks and extends the literature by using quantitative measures of risk-taking from the GPS and Gallup datasets in addition to the qualitative measures used in the literature. Based on the available observed risk-taking data for one year, this article proposes a semi-supervised machine learning-based approach that can efficiently predict the observed risk index for those countries/individuals for years when the observed risk-taking index was not collected. We find that linear models are insufficient to capture certain patterns among risk-taking factors, and non-linear models, such as random forest regression, can obtain better root mean squared values than those reported in past literature. In addition to finding factors that agree with past studies, we also find that subjective well-being influences risk-taking behavior.",

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning techniques has facilitated the automatic annotation of behavior in video sequences, offering a promising approach for ethological studies by reducing the manual effort required for annotating each video frame. Nevertheless, before solely relying on machine-generated annotations, it is essential to evaluate the accuracy of these annotations to ensure their reliability and applicability. While it is conventionally accepted that there cannot be a perfect annotation, the degree of error associated with machine-generated annotations should be commensurate with the error between different human annotators. The authors hypothesized that machine learning supervised with adequate human annotations would be able to accurately predict body parts from video sequences. The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the quality of annotations generated by humans and machines for the body parts of sheep during treadmill walking. For human annotation, two annotators manually labeled six body parts of sheep in 300 frames. To generate machine annotations, the authors employed the state-of-the-art pose-estimating library, DeepLabCut, which was trained using the frames annotated by human annotators. As expected, the human annotations demonstrated high consistency between annotators. Notably, the machine learning algorithm also generated accurate predictions, with errors comparable to those between humans. They also observed that abnormal annotations with a high error could be revised by introducing Kalman Filtering, which interpolates the trajectory of body parts over the time series, enhancing robustness. Their results suggest that conventional transfer learning methods can generate behavior annotations as accurate as those made by humans, presenting great potential for further research.",

        "abstract": "This study introduces SkinLiTE, a lightweight supervised contrastive learning model, tailored to enhance the detection and typification of skin lesions in dermoscopic images. The core of SkinLiTE lies in its unique integration of supervised and contrastive learning approaches, which leverages labeled data to learn generalizable representations. This approach is particularly adept at handling the complexities and imbalances inherent in skin lesions datasets. The methodology encompasses a two-phase learning process. In the first phase, SkinLiTE utilizes an encoder network and a projection head to transform and project dermoscopic images into a feature space where contrastive loss is applied, focusing on minimizing intra-class variations while maximizing inter-class differences. The second phase freezes the encoder&#039;s weights, leveraging the learned representations for classification through a series of dense and dropout layers. The model was evaluated using three datasets from Skin Cancer ISIC 2019-2020, covering a wide range of skin conditions. SkinLiTE demonstrated superior performance across various metrics—accuracy, AUC , and F1 score—particularly when compared with traditional supervised learning models. Notably, SkinLiTE achieved an accuracy of 0.9087 using AugMix augmentation for binary classification of skin lesions. It also showed comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches of ISIC challenge without relying on external data, underscoring its efficacy and efficiency. The results highlight the potential of SkinLiTE as a significant step forward in the field of dermatological AI, offering a robust, efficient, and accurate tool for skin lesion detection and classification. Its lightweight architecture and ability to handle imbalanced datasets make it particularly suited for integration into Internet of Medical Things environments, paving the way for enhanced remote patient monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. This research contributes to the evolving landscape of AI in healthcare, demonstrating the impact of innovative learning methodologies in medical image analysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere is a growing interest in using computer-assisted models for the detection of macular conditions using optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. As the quantity of clinical scan data of specific conditions is limited, these models are typically developed by fine-tuning a generalized network to classify specific macular conditions of interest. Full thickness macular holes (FTMH) present a condition requiring timely surgical intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. Other works on automated FTMH classification have tended to use supervised ImageNet pre-trained networks with good results but leave room for improvement. In this paper, we develop a model for FTMH classification using OCT slices around the central foveal region to pre-train a naïve network using contrastive self-supervised learning. We found that self-supervised pre-trained networks outperform ImageNet pre-trained networks despite a small training set size (284 eyes total, 51 FTMH+ eyes, 3 slices from each eye). 3D spatial contrast pre-training yields a model with an F1-score of 1.0 on holdout data (50 eyes total, 10 FTMH+), compared ImageNet pre-trained models, respectively. These results demonstrate that even limited data may be applied toward self-supervised pre-training to substantially improve performance for FTMH classification, indicating applicability toward other OCT-based problems.Author SummaryFull thickness macular holes (FTMH) are a sight-threatening condition that involves the fovea, the area of the eye involved in central vision. Timely diagnosis is paramount because of the risk of permanent vision loss. In clinical practice, full thickness macular holes are commonly diagnosed with the aid of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the fovea. However, certain conditions such as pseudoholes and epiretinal membranes may complicate the diagnosis of full thickness macular holes on imaging. Here, we employ the use of artificial intelligence and present a machine-learning model for full thickness macular hole classification and distinction from conditions that may present similarly upon image review. Despite training our model with a smaller data set, it outperformed traditional models previously seen in other works. We provide a strong framework for a self-supervised pre-trained model that can accurately distinguish full thickness macular holes from epiretinal membranes and pseudoholes. Overall, our study provides evidence of the benefit and efficacy with the introduction of artificial intelligence for image classification.",

        "abstract": "Automatic Student performance prediction is a crucial job due to the large volume of data in educational databases. This job is being addressed by educational data mining (EDM). EDM develop methods for discovering data that is derived from educational environment. These methods are used for understanding student and their learning environment. The educational institutions are often curious that how many students will be pass/fail for necessary arrangements. In previous studies, it has been observed that many researchers have intension on the selection of appropriate algorithm for just classification and ignores the solutions of the problems which comes during data mining phases such as data high dimensionality ,class imbalance and classification error etc. Such types of problems reduced the accuracy of the model.\r\n\r\nSeveral well-known classification algorithms are applied in this domain but this paper proposed a student performance prediction model based on supervised learning decision tree classifier. In addition, an ensemble method is applied to improve the performance of the classifier. Ensemble methods approach is designed to solve classification, predictions problems. \r\n\r\nThis study proves the importance of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks to resolve the data quality issues. The experimental dataset used in this work belongs to Alentejo region of Portugal which is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Three supervised learning algorithms (J48, NNge and MLP) are employed in this study for experimental purposes. The results showed that J48 achieved highest accuracy 95.78% among others.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundAssigning every human gene to specific functions, diseases, and traits is a grand challenge in modern genetics. Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods such as supervised-learning and label-propagation that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine learning technique across fields, supervised-learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype-, or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised-learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label-propagation, the widely-benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.ResultsIn this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised-learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a state-of-the-art label-propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised-learning on a gene’s full network connectivity outperforms label-propagation and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label-propagation’s appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised-learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node-embeddings (derived using node2vec), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity.ConclusionThese results show that supervised-learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases, and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows. The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.Contactarjun@msu.edu",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhile cases of uveal melanoma are relatively rare overall, it remains the most common intraocular cancer in adults and has a 10-year fatality rate of approximately 50% in metastatic patients with no effective treatment options. Mutations in BAP1, a tumor suppressor gene, have been previously found to be associated with the onset of metastasis in uveal melanoma patients. In this study, I utilize a weakly supervised deep learning-based pipeline in order to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) of uveal melanoma patients in conjunction with slide-level labels regarding the presence of BAP1 mutations. I demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between BAP1 mutations and physical tumor development in uveal melanoma and that my model is able to predict such relationships with an optimized mean test AUC of 0.86. My findings demonstrate that deep learning models are able to accurately predict patient-specific genotypic characteristics in uveal melanoma. Once integrated into and adapted to existing non-invasive ocular scanner technologies, my model would assist healthcare professionals in understanding the specific genetic profiles of their patients and provide more personalized treatment options in a safe, efficient manner, thus resulting in improved treatment outcomes.",

These advances have been possible due to large-scale datasets like ExoNet and StairNet - the largest open-source image datasets of real-world walking environments. However, these datasets require vast amounts of manually annotated data, the development of which is time consuming and labor intensive. Here we present a novel semi-supervised learning system (ExoNet-SSL) that uses over 1.2 million unlabelled images from ExoNet to improve training efficiency. We developed a deep learning model based on mobile vision transformers and trained the model using semi-supervised learning for image classification. Compared to standard supervised learning (98.4%), our ExoNet-SSL system was able to maintain high prediction accuracy (98.8%) when tested on previously unseen environments, while requiring 35% fewer labelled images during training. These results show that semi-supervised learning can improve training efficiency by leveraging large amounts of unlabelled data and minimize the size requirements for manually annotated images. Future research will focus on model deployment for onboard real-time inference and control of human-robot walking.",

From basic regression models to neural networks, countless methods have been proposed to solve the house price prediction problem. In this paper, the focus is the performance of three regression models, linear, LASSO, and ridge. There will be a selected dataset of sold houses from the open-source website. The data will be explored and visualized for a better understanding and then implement the regression models for further testing. According to the analysis, the LASSO regression model can yield the most accurate prediction with 90.15% accuracy but need a specific λ value. The linear and ridge regression yields similar predictions with close to 90% accuracy. Therefore, the most effective model for the house price prediction problem is the LASSO regression model. Overall, these results shed light on guiding further exploration of the performance of different machine learning models.",

But generally, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not reliable and sustainable also they require more resources. In recent years so many machine learning methods are proposed to give higher accuracy with minimal false alerts. But analyzing those huge traffic data is still challenging. So, in this article, we proposed a technique using the Support Vector Machine & Naive Bayes algorithm, by using this we can solve the classification problem of the intrusion detection system. For evaluating our proposed method, we use NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 dataset. And after getting the result we see that the SVM works better than the Naive Bayes algorithm on that dataset.",

        "abstract": "Current weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods with image-level labels mainly adopt class activation maps (CAM) to generate the initial pseudo labels. However, CAM usually only identifies the most discriminative object extents, which is attributed to the fact that the network doesn't need to discover the integral object to recognize image-level labels. In this work, to tackle this problem, we proposed to simultaneously learn the image-level labels and local visual word labels. Specifically, in each forward propagation, the feature maps of the input image will be encoded to visual words with a learnable codebook. By enforcing the network to classify the encoded fine-grained visual words, the generated CAM could cover more semantic regions. Besides, we also proposed a hybrid spatial pyramid pooling module that could preserve local maximum and global average values of feature maps, so that more object details and less background were considered. Based on the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Our proposed method achieved 67.2% mIoU on the val set and 67.3% mIoU on the test set, which outperformed recent state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDifferent types of microscopy are used to uncover signatures of cell adhesion and mechanics. Automating the identification and analysis often involve sacrificial routines of cell manipulation such as in vitro staining. Phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) is rarely used in automation due to the difficulties with poor quality images. However, it is the least intrusive method to provide insights into the dynamics of cells, where other types of microscopy are too destructive to monitor. In this study, we propose an efficient workflow to automate cell counting and morphology in PCM images. We introduce Cell Adhesion with Supervised Training and Learning Environment (CASTLE), available as a series of additional plugins to ImageJ. CASTLE combines effective techniques for phase-contrast image processing with statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms to interpret the results. The proposed workflow was validated by comparing the results to a manual count and manual segmentation of cells in images investigating different adherent cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils and platelets. In addition, the effect of different molecules on cell adhesion was characterised using CASTLE. For example, we demonstate that Galectin-9 leads to differences in adhesion of leukocytes. CASTLE also provides information using machine learning techniques, namely principal component analysis and k-means clustering, to distinguish morphology currently inaccessible with manual methods. All scripts and documentation is open-source and available at the corresponding GitLab project.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPatent data provides rich information about technical inventions, but does not disclose the ethnic origin of inventors. In this article, I use supervised learning techniques to infer this information. To do so, I construct a dataset of 96′777 labeled names and train an artificial recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict ethnic origins based on names. The trained network achieves an overall performance of 91.4% across 18 ethnic origins. I use this model to predict and investigate the ethnic origins of 2.68 million inventors and provide novel descriptive evidence regarding their ethnic origin composition over time and across countries and technological fields. The global ethnic origin composition has become more diverse over the last decades, which was mostly due to a relative increase of Asian origin inventors. Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-Western inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other high-income countries.",

        "abstract": "Most semi-supervised learning methods over-sample labeled data when constructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common practice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting where each minibatch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more general and even necessary in multitask problems where over-sampling labeled data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10 image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect pseudo-labels.",

We evaluate it on semi-supervised semantic segmentation on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC with different percentages of labeled data and ablate design choices and hyper-parameters.

ATP was formed in Sep 1972 for professional tennis players. A study has been done on tennis players’ datasets to implement supervised machine learning techniques to illustrate match data and make predictions. An appropriate dataset has been chosen, data cleaning has been implemented to extract anomalies, data is visualized via plotting methods in R language and supervised machine learning models applied. The main models applied are linear regression and decision tree. Results and predictions have been extracted from the applied models. In the linear regression model, the correlation is calculated to find the relation between dependent and independent variables, furthermore the results and prediction are extracted from the linear regression model. Also, three hypotheses are applied for multiple linear regression model. The decision tree modeled the best of 3 or best of 5 sets of matches and predicted which set of matches would be considered best.  Keywords: Machine Learning, supervised learning, linear regression, decision tree, R language, Tennis, ATP.",

        "abstract": "Learning a sequence of tasks is a long-standing challenge in machine learning. This setting applies to learning systems that observe examples of a range of tasks at different points in time. A learning system should become more knowledgeable as more related tasks are learned. Although the problem of learning sequentially was acknowledged for the first time decades ago, the research in this area has been rather limited. Research in transfer learning, multitask learning, metalearning and deep learning has studied some challenges of these kinds of systems. Recent research in lifelong machine learning and continual learning has revived interest in this problem. We propose Proficiente, a full framework for long-term learning systems. Proficiente relies on knowledge transferred between hypotheses learned with Support Vector Machines. The first component of the framework is focused on transferring forward selectively from a set of existing hypotheses or functions representing knowledge acquired during previous tasks to a new target task. A second component of Proficiente is focused on transferring backward, a novel ability of long-term learning systems that aim to exploit knowledge derived from recent tasks to encourage refinement of existing knowledge. We propose a method that transfers selectively from a task learned recently to existing hypotheses representing previous tasks. The method encourages retention of existing knowledge whilst refining. We analyse the theoretical properties of the proposed framework. Proficiente is accompanied by an agnostic metric that can be used to determine if a long-term learning system is becoming more knowledgeable. We evaluate Proficiente in both synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate scenarios where knowledgeable supervised learning systems can be achieved by means of transfer.",

        "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Weather and climate are well known exemplars of chaotic systems exhibiting extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Initial condition errors are subject to exponential growth on average, but the rate and the characteristic of such growth is highly state dependent. In an ideal setting where the degree of predictability of the system is known in real-time, it may be possible and beneficial to take adaptive measures. For instance a local decrease of predictability may be counteracted by increasing the time- or space-resolution of the model computation or the ensemble size in the context of ensemble-based data assimilation or probabilistic forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Lyapunov exponents (LLEs) describe growth rates along a finite-time section of a system trajectory. This makes the LLEs the ideal quantities to measure the local degree of predictability, yet a main bottleneck for their real-time use in&amp;#160;&amp;#160;operational scenarios is the huge computational cost. Calculating LLEs involves computing a long trajectory of the system, propagating perturbations with the tangent linear model, and repeatedly orthogonalising them. We investigate if machine learning (ML) methods can estimate the LLEs based only on information from the system&amp;#8217;s solution, thus avoiding the need to evolve perturbations via the tangent linear model. We test the ability of four algorithms (regression tree, multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network) to perform this task in two prototypical low dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. Our results suggest that the accuracy of the ML predictions is highly dependent upon the nature of the distribution of the LLE values in phase space: large prediction errors occur in regions of the attractor where the LLE values are highly non-smooth.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In line with classical dynamical systems studies, the neutral LLE is more difficult to predict. We show that a comparatively simple regression tree can achieve performance that is similar to sophisticated neural networks, and that the success of ML strategies for exploiting the temporal structure of data depends on the system dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Now-a-days, people around the world are infected by many new diseases. The cost of developing or discovering a new drug for the newly discovered disease is very high and prolonged process. These could be eliminated with the help of already existing resources. To identify the candidates from the existing drugs, we need to extract the relation between the drug, target and disease by textming a large-scale literature. Recently, computational approaches which is used for identifying the relationships between the entities in biomedical domain are appearing as an active area of research for drug discovery as it needs more man power. Due to the limited computational approaches, the relation extraction between drug-gene and genedisease association from the unstructured biomedical documents is very hard. In this work, we proposed a semi-supervised approach named pattern based bootstrapping method to extract the direct relations between drug, gene and disease from the biomedical literature. These direct relationships are used to infer indirect relationships between entities such as drug and disease. Now these indirect relationships are used to determine the new candidates for drug repositioning which in turn will reduce the time and the patient’s risk.",

We develop a solution using the gathered labelled data points, by experimenting with various multi-class supervised learning models such as K Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. We also account for the issue of class imbalance, and thus conduct experiments to determine a suitable oversampling methodology for addressing this concern.

Therefore, a pipeline defect estimation method based on supervised learning ensemble model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, several typical feature factors are calculated using feature formulas in the field of acoustics, capable of distinguishing the defect signal variability. Thereafter, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis and Random Forest importance ranking feature analysis methods are utilized to filter out the more valuable features. To improve the performance of defect estimation, a fusion model combining qualitative and quantitative analysis based on Random Forest and XGBoost is constructed to preferentially identify the type of defect signal qualitatively and then predict the size quantitatively. Finally, experimental results and comprehensive analysis with other mainstream supervised learning methods indicate that the prediction error of this method is basically below 1.5%, which addresses the issue of the low estimation accuracy of traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "Data used by current Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) systems has mostly been manually labelled for supervision. However, it might be difficult to find large amounts of annotated data, especially in fields with a high level of specialization, such as biomedical, bioinformatics, and so on. When dictionaries and ontologies are available, which are domain-specific knowledge resources, automatically tagged distantly supervised biomedical training data can be developed. However, any such distantly supervised NER result is normally noisy. The prevalence of false positives and false negatives with this type of autonomously generated data is the main problem that directly affects efficiency. This research investigates distant supervision to detect false positive occurrences in BioNER task. A reinforcement learning technique is employed that is modelled as a graphical processing unit (GPU) accelerated Markov decision process (MDP) with a neural network policy. To deal with false negative cases, we employ a partial annotation conditional random field (CRF) technique. Results on two benchmark datasets show a cutting-edge methodology that can enhance the functionality of the neural NER system. It goes on to show how the proposed approach cuts down on human annotated data for BioNER tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",

However, these approaches may underutilize the intrinsic properties of traffic data and suffer from overfitting due to their local nature. This paper introduces the Implicit Sensing Self-Supervised learning model (ISSS) to address these issues. ISSS leverages a multi-pretext task framework for traffic flow prediction, integrating multiple self-supervised tasks, including contrastive learning and spatial jigsaw puzzles, to learn both specific and general representations. ISSS emphasizes capturing the intrinsic spatial relationships among sensor locations, particularly through spatial and temporal jigsaw puzzles. These tasks explore the correlation between traffic patterns at sensor locations and critical temporal periods, recognizing the significance of temporal information in traffic data. By transforming data into an alternative feature space, ISSS facilitates the adoption of contrastive learning tasks, enhancing regularization, and promoting a deeper understanding of learned traffic features, resulting in more specific representations. Comparative experiments on six datasets demonstrate ISSS's effectiveness in learning general and discriminative features in both supervised and unsupervised modes. ISSS outperforms existing models, showcasing its potential for improving traffic flow prediction while addressing challenges associated with local operations and overfitting.",

A few recent studies have demonstrated that the self-supervised learning is a promising solution to addressing insufficient labels of proteins, which is a major obstacle to effective protein representation learning. However, existing protein representation learning is usually pretrained on protein sequences without considering the important protein structural information.\n\n\nResults\nIn this work, we propose a novel structure-aware protein self-supervised learning method to effectively capture structural information of proteins. In particular, a graph neural network model is pretrained to preserve the protein structural information with self-supervised tasks from a pairwise residue distance perspective and a dihedral angle perspective, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the available protein language model pretrained on protein sequences to enhance the self-supervised learning. Specifically, we identify the relation between the sequential information in the protein language model and the structural information in the specially designed graph neural network model via a novel pseudo bi-level optimization scheme. We conduct experiments on three downstream tasks: the binary classification into membrane/non-membrane proteins, the location classification into 10 cellular compartments, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification into 384 EC numbers, and these experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nThe Alphafold2 database is available in https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/.

Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes such as nuclear, cytoplasmic and vesicular, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself’s ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complex clusters using a clustering score, and show that cytoself attains higher scores than previous unsupervised or self-supervised approaches. Finally, to better understand the inner workings of our model, we dissect the emergent features from which our clustering is derived, interpret these features in the context of the fluorescence images, and analyze the performance contributions of the different components of our approach.",

        "abstract": "AbstractTime-based comparisons of single-cell trajectories are challenging due to their intrinsic heterogeneity, autonomous decisions, dynamic transitions and unequal lengths. In this paper, we present a self-supervised framework combining an image autoencoder with dynamic time series analysis of latent feature space to represent, compare and annotate cell cycle phases across singlecell trajectories. In our fully data-driven approach, we map similarities between heterogeneous cell tracks and generate statistical representations of single-cell trajectory phase durations, onset and transitions. This work is a first effort to transform a sequence of learned image representations from cell cycle-specific reporters into an unsupervised sequence annotation.",

        "abstract": "The practicality of distinct vehicular communication tissue classifiers is based on lighting training records that replicate a place or purchase circumstance. The use of transfer learning technologies to address sampling mistakes caused by sparse annotations during supervised learning on automated tumour segmentation is recommended. The comprehensive record of a recognised event might be rather extensive. The suggested method is based on a simple and sparse description, and it effectively corrects systematic sampling mistakes for diverse tissue types using domain correction methodologies. A retrospective examination of the 2013 challenge data sets and a multimodal MR image from 19 malignant gliomas patients verified the present strategy. When compared to training on entirely marked outcomes, the time to mark and train is reduced by more than 70 and 180 seconds respectively. This considerably facilitates the creation and ongoing extension of annotated large datasets in a variety of circumstances and imaging environments; this is an important step in the actual deployment of tissue categorization learning algorithms.",

In this article, an automatic opinion classifier capable of automatically classifying tweets into different opinions expressed by them is developed. Also, a manually annotated corpus for opinion mining to be used by supervised learning algorithms is designed. An opinion classifier uses semantic, lexical, domain dependent, and context features for classification. Results obtained confirm competitive performance and the robustness of the system.

        "abstract": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF classification model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. Our proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on our unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.</p>",

        "abstract": "Weather forecasting has always been challenging due to the atmosphere’s complex and dynamic nature. Weather conditions such as rain, clouds, clear skies, and sunniness are influenced by several factors, including temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and direction. Physical and complex models are currently used to determine weather conditions, but they have their limitations, particularly in terms of computing time. In recent years, supervised machine learning methods have shown great potential in predicting weather events accurately. These methods use historical weather data to train a model, which can then be used to predict future weather conditions. This study enhances weather forecasting by employing four supervised machine learning techniques—artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)—on three distinct datasets obtained from the Weatherstack database. These datasets, with varying temporal spans and uncertainty levels in their input features, are used to train and evaluate the methods. The results show that the ANN has superior performance across all datasets. Furthermore, when compared to Weatherstack’s weather prediction model, all methods demonstrate significant improvements. Interestingly, our models show variance in performance across different datasets, particularly those with predicted rather than observed input features, underscoring the complexities of handling data uncertainty. The study provides valuable insights into the use of supervised machine learning techniques for weather forecasting and contributes to the development of more precise prediction models.",

        "abstract": "Background: ChatGPT is becoming a new reality. Where do we go from here? Objective: to show how we can distinguish ChatGPT-generated publications from counterparts produced by scientist. Methods:By means of a new algorithm, called xFakeBibs, we show the significant difference between ChatGPT-generated fake publications and real publications. Specifically, we triggered ChatGPT to generate 100 publications that were related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and comorbidity. Using TF-IDF, using the real publications, we constructed a training network of bigrams comprised of 100 publications. Using 10-folds of 100 publications each, we also 10 calibrating networks to derive lower/upper bounds for classifying articles as real or fake. The final step was to test xFakeBibs against each of the ChatGPT-generated articles and predict its class. The algorithm successfully assigned the POSITIVE label for real ones and NEGATIVE for fake ones. Results: When comparing the bigrams of the training set against all the other 10 calibrating folds, we found that the similarities fluctuated between (19%-21%). On the other hand, the mere bigram similarity from the ChatGPT was only (8%). Additionally, when testing how the various bigrams generated from the calibrating 10-folds against ChatGPT we found that all 10 calibrating folds contributed (51%-70%) of new bigrams, while ChatGPT contributed only 23%, which is less than 50% of any of the other 10 calibrating folds. The final classification results using the xFakeBibs set a lower/upper bound of (21.96-24.93) number of new edges to the training mode without contributing new nodes. Using this calibration range, the algorithm predicted 98 of the 100 publications as fake, while 2 articles failed the test and were classified as real publications. Conclusions: This work provided clear evidence of how to distinguish, in bulk ChatGPT-generated fake publications from real publications. Also, we also introduced an algorithmic approach that detected fake articles with a high degree of accuracy. However, it remains challenging to detect all fake records. ChatGPT may seem to be a useful tool, but it certainly presents a threat to our authentic knowledge and real science. This work is indeed a step in the right direction to counter fake science and misinformation.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere is a growing interest in using computer-assisted models for the detection of macular conditions using optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. As the quantity of clinical scan data of specific conditions is limited, these models are typically developed by fine-tuning a generalized network to classify specific macular conditions of interest. Full thickness macular holes (FTMH) present a condition requiring timely surgical intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. Other works on automated FTMH classification have tended to use supervised ImageNet pre-trained networks with good results but leave room for improvement. In this paper, we develop a model for FTMH classification using OCT slices around the central foveal region to pre-train a naïve network using contrastive self-supervised learning. We found that self-supervised pre-trained networks outperform ImageNet pre-trained networks despite a small training set size (284 eyes total, 51 FTMH+ eyes, 3 slices from each eye). 3D spatial contrast pre-training yields a model with an F1-score of 1.0 on holdout data (50 eyes total, 10 FTMH+), compared ImageNet pre-trained models, respectively. These results demonstrate that even limited data may be applied toward self-supervised pre-training to substantially improve performance for FTMH classification, indicating applicability toward other OCT-based problems.Author SummaryFull thickness macular holes (FTMH) are a sight-threatening condition that involves the fovea, the area of the eye involved in central vision. Timely diagnosis is paramount because of the risk of permanent vision loss. In clinical practice, full thickness macular holes are commonly diagnosed with the aid of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the fovea. However, certain conditions such as pseudoholes and epiretinal membranes may complicate the diagnosis of full thickness macular holes on imaging. Here, we employ the use of artificial intelligence and present a machine-learning model for full thickness macular hole classification and distinction from conditions that may present similarly upon image review. Despite training our model with a smaller data set, it outperformed traditional models previously seen in other works. We provide a strong framework for a self-supervised pre-trained model that can accurately distinguish full thickness macular holes from epiretinal membranes and pseudoholes. Overall, our study provides evidence of the benefit and efficacy with the introduction of artificial intelligence for image classification.",

EDM develop methods for discovering data that is derived from educational environment. These methods are used for understanding student and their learning environment. The educational institutions are often curious that how many students will be pass/fail for necessary arrangements. In previous studies, it has been observed that many researchers have intension on the selection of appropriate algorithm for just classification and ignores the solutions of the problems which comes during data mining phases such as data high dimensionality ,class imbalance and classification error etc. Such types of problems reduced the accuracy of the model.\r\n\r\nSeveral well-known classification algorithms are applied in this domain but this paper proposed a student performance prediction model based on supervised learning decision tree classifier. In addition, an ensemble method is applied to improve the performance of the classifier. Ensemble methods approach is designed to solve classification, predictions problems. \r\n\r\nThis study proves the importance of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks to resolve the data quality issues.

        "abstract": "To successfully train a deep neural network, a large amount of human-labeled data is required. Unfortunately, in many areas, collecting and labeling data is a difficult and tedious task. Several ways have been developed to mitigate the problem associated with the shortage of data, the most common of which is transfer learning. However, in many cases, the use of transfer learning as the only remedy is insufficient. In this study, we improve deep neural models training and increase the classification accuracy under a scarcity of data by the use of the self-supervised learning technique. Self-supervised learning allows an unlabeled dataset to be used for pretraining the network, as opposed to transfer learning that requires labeled datasets. The pretrained network can be then fine-tuned using the annotated data. Moreover, we investigated the effect of combining the self-supervised learning approach with transfer learning. It is shown that this strategy outperforms network training from scratch or with transfer learning. The tests were conducted on a very important and sensitive application (skin lesion classification), but the presented approach can be applied to a broader family of applications, especially in the medical domain where the scarcity of data is a real problem.",

Plant disease classification is thus\nan important step in the control of plant diseases. Traditionally,\ndirect, and indirect procedures such as RT-PCR or thermography were\nused, which are costly, need a qualified expert, and do not provide a\nreal-time diagnostic. Plant diseases are caused by a variety of\npathogens and recognizing them using machine learning is a significant\nfocus of this research because there hasn’t been much work done in this\narea of plant health monitoring, and early detection of the pathogen can\nprovide insights into how to best treat the infestation. We employed\ncomputer vision techniques to extract features of diseased leaves from\nthe PlantVillage dataset and produced promising results utilizing\nseveral Supervised Machine Learning techniques such as Random Forest,\nSVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN to classify the pathogen type. We also focused\non optimizing the dataset by finding the best-suited filters for\nidentifying plant pathogens using a novel technique we developed to\norganize the filters in the best possible order, as well as determining\nthe best hyperparameters for our model.\n",

        "abstract": "The paper deals with predicting grade point average (GPA) with supervised machine learning models. Based on the literature review, we divide the factors into three groups—psychological, sociological and study factors. Data from the questionnaire are evaluated using statistical analysis. We use confirmatory data analysis, where we compare the answers of men and women, university students coming from grammar schools versus students coming from secondary vocational schools and students divided according to the average grade. The differences between groups are tested with the Shapiro–Wilk and Mann–Whitney U-test. We identify the factors influencing the GPA through correlation analysis, where we use the Pearson test and the ANOVA. Based on the performed analysis, factors that show a statistically significant dependence with the GPA are identified. Subsequently, we implement supervised machine learning models. We create 10 prediction models using linear regression, decision trees and random forest. The models predict the GPA based on independent variables. Based on the MAPE metric on the five validation sets in cross-validation, the best generalization accuracy is achieved by a random forest model—its average MAPE is 11.13%. Therefore, we recommend the use of a random forest as a starting model for modeling student results.",

The purpose of this study is to find the most appropriate algorithm(s) with minimum prediction errors to predict the costs of the BT-enabled PSC model. This paper also aims to determine the importance and cost of each component of the multi-function model. To reach these goals, we combined four Supervised Learning algorithms (KNN, DT, SVM, and NB) with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (HS and PSO) after data generation. Each component of the multi-function model has its own importance, and we applied the Feature Weighting approach to analyse their importance. Next, four performance metrics evaluated the multi-function model, and the Total Ranking Score determined predictive algorithms with high reliability. The results indicate the HS-NB and PSO-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in predicting the costs of the multi-function model with small errors. The findings also show that the Raw Materials cost has a stronger influence on the model than the other components. This study also introduces the components of the multi-function BT-enabled PSC model.",

        "abstract": "The highest strength-to-weight ratio criterion has fascinated curiosity increasingly in virtually all areas where heft reduction is indispensable. Lightweight materials and their joining processes are also a recent point of research demands in the manufacturing industries. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is one of the recent advancements for joining materials without adding any third material (filler rod) and joining below the melting point of the parent material. The process is widely used for joining similar and dissimilar metals, especially lightweight non-ferrous materials like aluminum, copper, and magnesium alloys. This paper presents verdicts of optimum process parameters on attaining enhanced mechanical properties of the weld joint. The experiment was conducted on a 5 mm 6061 aluminum alloy sheet. Process parameters; tool material, rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial forces were utilized. Mechanical properties of the weld joint are examined employing a tensile test, and the maximum joint strength efficiency was reached 94.2%. Supervised Machine Learning based Regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms were used. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm yielded highest coefficient of determination value of 0.926 which means it gives a best fit in comparison to other algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to object detection and localization tasks in images. When setting up deep learning frameworks for supervised training with large datasets, strongly labeling the objects facilitates good performance; however, the complexity of the image scene and large size of the dataset make this a laborious task. Hence, it is of paramount importance that the expensive work associated with the tasks involving strong labeling, such as bounding box annotation, is reduced. In this paper, we propose a method to perform object localization tasks without bounding box annotation in the training process by means of employing a two-path activation-map-based classifier framework. In particular, we develop an activation-map-based framework to judicially control the attention map in the perception branch by adding a two-feature extractor so that better attention weights can be distributed to induce improved performance. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the performance of the existing deep learning models based on weakly supervised object localization. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance, with 75.21% Top-1 classification accuracy and 55.15% Top-1 localization accuracy on the CUB-200-2011 dataset.",

Traditional manual facies prediction using well log data are characterized by uncertainties and are often time consuming especially when working with large datasets. Machine learning provides a more efficient way of predicting facies when applied to large data. In this study we consider unsupervised learning approach: clustering and supervised learning approach: support vector machine for facies classification. Unsupervised learning was done using only raw and processed well logs parameters and the responses were grouped into various clusters based on similarities. Optimal number of clusters were selected from the elbow plot and dendogram. The supervised learning is done using well logs-raw and processed parameters. The targeted output was depofacies defined using core facies derived from core data. Both approaches showed good results with less uncertainty and bias when compared to already established facies defined from core data. The result from this process provides a more realistic input for generating facies models.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SS-GANs) models such as GAN-BERT have achieved promising results on the text classification task. One of the techniques used in these models to mitigate the generator from mode collapse is feature matching (FM). Although FM addresses some of the critical issues of SS-GANs, these models still suffer from mode collapse with missing coverage outside the data manifold. Moreover, FM loosely tries to match the distribution between the real data and the fake generated samples. By doing this, the generator can generate fake samples inside high-density regions in the data manifold, where the discriminator learns to misclassify them as out-of-data-manifold regions. In this work, we employ the negative data augmentation (NDA) technique, for the first time in text classification, to alleviate the mentioned problems. NDA is a unique way of producing out-of-distribution fake examples by applying mixup transformation on the fake samples and augmented real data. In our new model (NDA-GAN), we produce NDA samples by combining the generator's output with the contextual representation of the real data. As a result of the mixing, NDA samples are less likely to place in the high-density regions, and due to blending with real data representations, these samples reasonably preserve a close distance to the data manifold. Consequently, the NDA samples increase the discriminator's power to find the optimal decision boundary. Our experimental results demonstrate that the negative augmented samples improve the overall accuracy of our proposed model and make it more confident when detecting out-of-distribution samples.\r\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractGram-negative bacteria are responsible for hundreds of millions infections worldwide, including the emerging hospital-acquired infections and neglected tropical diseases in the third-world countries. Finding a fast and cheap way to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the bacterial infections is critical for efficient diagnostics and treatment. An important step towards understanding these mechanisms is discovering bacterial effectors, the proteins secreted into the host through one of the six common secretion system types. Unfortunately, current effector prediction methods are designed to specifically target one of three secretion systems, and no accurate “secretion system-agnostic” method is available.Here, we present PREFFECTOR, a computational feature-based approach to discover effectors in Gram-negative bacteria without prior knowledge on bacterial secretion system(s) or cryptic secretion signals. Our approach was first evaluated using several assessment protocols on a manually curated, balanced dataset of experimentally determined effectors across all six secretion systems as well as non-effector proteins. The evaluation revealed high accuracy of the top performing classifiers in PREFFECTOR, with the small false positive discovery rate across all six secretion systems. Our method was also applied to four bacteria that had limited knowledge on virulence factors or secreted effectors. PREFFECTOR web-server is freely available at: http://korkinlab.org/preffector.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe absence of key input parameters and use of least squares technique have resulted in most of the available empirical ground motion prediction models (GMPEs) in India, as a function of epicentral distances and magnitudes, resulting in large uncertainty in the predictive model. Here we apply a supervised Machine Learning technique (XGBoost) to design a robust improved GMPE of peak ground acceleration (PGA) for the Indian sub-continent and Nepal, utilizing independent input parameters viz., moment magnitudes, hypocentral distances, focal depths and site proxy (in terms of average seismic shear-wave velocity from the surface to a depth of 30m (Vs30)). This has been achieved using PGA dataset of nine earthquakes of Mw5.6-7.9 from Nepal Himalaya, Uttarakhand Himalaya, Kachchh (Gujarat), and Koyna (Maharashtra). Our dataset also includes 225 strong-motion records of 30 significant Bhuj aftershocks of Mw3.3-5.0 (during 2002–2008) with epicentral distances ranging from 1.0 to 288 km. We also test the ground motion predictability of our supervised ML model using the whole dataset and randomized test dataset (30% of total data points). The correlation coefficient of observed and predicted PGA values for the whole dataset is found to be ±0.994 while our predictability on the randomized test dataset suggests a correlation coefficient of 0.944. Also, the model predictability of our supervised ML model suggests a good prediction of the observed PGA dataset for twelve Indian and Nepal earthquakes of Mw5.6-7.9 (viz., the 2001 Bhuj (Gujarat) earthquake sequence, the 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence, the 1999 Chamoli earthquake, the 1967 Koyna earthquake, the 2009 Mw6.2 Bhutan event and two Mw5.9 Myanmar-India border earthquakes of September 2009 and January 2013), suggesting that our ML GMPE model would work for earthquakes occurring in India and Nepal, within the range of Mw [3.3–7.9], focal depths [3–94 km], epicentral distances [1-565 km] and Vs30 [177–760 m/s].",

        "abstract": "Bone diseases are common and can result in various musculoskeletal conditions (MC). An estimated 1.71 billion patients suffer from musculoskeletal problems worldwide. Apart from musculoskeletal fractures, femoral neck injuries, knee osteoarthritis, and fractures are very common bone diseases, and the rate is expected to double in the next 30 years. Therefore, proper and timely diagnosis and treatment of a fractured patient are crucial. Contrastingly, missed fractures are a common prognosis failure in accidents and emergencies. This causes complications and delays in patients’ treatment and care. These days, artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning (DL) are receiving significant attention to assist radiologists in bone fracture detection. DL can be widely used in medical image analysis. Some studies in traumatology and orthopaedics have shown the use and potential of DL in diagnosing fractures and diseases from radiographs. In this systematic review, we provide an overview of the use of DL in bone imaging to help radiologists to detect various abnormalities, particularly fractures. We have also discussed the challenges and problems faced in the DL-based method, and the future of DL in bone imaging.",

        "abstract": "The copper mining industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence methods to improve cop-per production processes. Recent studies reveal the use of algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, among others, to develop models for predicting product quality. Other studies compare the predictive models developed with these machine learning algorithms in the mining industry, as a whole. However, not many copper mining studies published compare the results of machine learning techniques for copper recovery prediction. This study makes a detailed comparison between three models for predicting copper recovery by leaching, using four datasets resulting from mining operations in northern Chile. The algorithms used for developing the models were Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network. To validate these models, four indicators or values of merit were used: accuracy (acc), precision (p), recall (r), and Matthew&rsquo;s correlation coefficient (mcc). This paper describes dataset preparation and the refinement of the threshold values used for the predictive variable most influential on the class (the copper recovery). Results show both a precision over 98.50% and also the model with the best behavior between the predicted and the real. Finally, the models obtained show the following mean values: acc=94.32, p=88.47, r=99.59, and mcc=2.31. These values are highly competitive as compared with those obtained in similar studies using other approaches in the context.",

        "abstract": "Background: ChatGPT is becoming a new reality. Where do we go from here? Objective: to show how we can distinguish ChatGPT-generated publications from counterparts produced by scientist. Methods:By means of a new algorithm, called xFakeBibs, we show the significant difference between ChatGPT-generated fake publications and real publications. Specifically, we triggered ChatGPT to generate 100 publications that were related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and comorbidity. Using TF-IDF, using the real publications, we constructed a training network of bigrams comprised of 100 publications. Using 10-folds of 100 publications each, we also 10 calibrating networks to derive lower/upper bounds for classifying articles as real or fake. The final step was to test xFakeBibs against each of the ChatGPT-generated articles and predict its class. The algorithm successfully assigned the POSITIVE label for real ones and NEGATIVE for fake ones. Results: When comparing the bigrams of the training set against all the other 10 calibrating folds, we found that the similarities fluctuated between (19%-21%). On the other hand, the mere bigram similarity from the ChatGPT was only (8%). Additionally, when testing how the various bigrams generated from the calibrating 10-folds against ChatGPT we found that all 10 calibrating folds contributed (51%-70%) of new bigrams, while ChatGPT contributed only 23%, which is less than 50% of any of the other 10 calibrating folds. The final classification results using the xFakeBibs set a lower/upper bound of (21.96-24.93) number of new edges to the training mode without contributing new nodes. Using this calibration range, the algorithm predicted 98 of the 100 publications as fake, while 2 articles failed the test and were classified as real publications. Conclusions: This work provided clear evidence of how to distinguish, in bulk ChatGPT-generated fake publications from real publications. Also, we also introduced an algorithmic approach that detected fake articles with a high degree of accuracy. However, it remains challenging to detect all fake records. ChatGPT may seem to be a useful tool, but it certainly presents a threat to our authentic knowledge and real science. This work is indeed a step in the right direction to counter fake science and misinformation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith a spatial resolution of tens of microns, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) reconstructs microvascular structures and measures intravascular flows by tracking microbubbles (1–5 μm) in contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images. Since the size of CEUS bubble traces, e.g. 0.5–1 mm for ultrasound with a wavelength λ = 280 μm, is typically two orders of magnitude larger than the bubble diameter, accurately localizing microbubbles in noisy CEUS data is vital to the fidelity of the ULM results. In this paper, we introduce a residual learning based supervised super-resolution blind deconvolution network (SupBD-net), and a new loss function for a self-supervised blind deconvolution network (SelfBD-net), for detecting bubble centers at a spatial resolution finer than λ/10. Our ultimate purpose is to improve the ability to distinguish closely located microvessels and the accuracy of the velocity profile measurements in macrovessels. Using realistic synthetic data, the performance of these methods is calibrated and compared against several recently introduced deep learning and blind deconvolution techniques. For bubble detection, errors in bubble center location increase with the trace size, noise level, and bubble concentration. For all cases, SupBD-net yields the least error, keeping it below 0.1 λ. For unknown bubble trace morphology, where all the supervised learning methods fail, SelfBD-net can still maintain an error of less than 0.15 λ. SupBD-net also outperforms the other methods in separating closely located bubbles and parallel microvessels. In macrovessels, SupBD-net maintains the least errors in the vessel radius and velocity profile after introducing a procedure that corrects for terminated tracks caused by overlapping traces. Application of these methods is demonstrated by mapping the cerebral microvasculature of a neonatal pig, where neighboring microvessels separated by 0.15 λ can be readily distinguished by SupBD-net and SelfBD-net, but not by the other techniques. Hence, the newly proposed residual learning based methods improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of ULM in micro- and macro-vessels.",

        "abstract": "The highest strength-to-weight ratio criterion has fascinated curiosity increasingly in virtually all areas where heft reduction is indispensable. Lightweight materials and their joining processes are also a recent point of research demands in the manufacturing industries. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is one of the recent advancements for joining materials without adding any third material (filler rod) and joining below the melting point of the parent material. The process is widely used for joining similar and dissimilar metals, especially lightweight non-ferrous materials like aluminum, copper, and magnesium alloys. This paper presents verdicts of optimum process parameters on attaining enhanced mechanical properties of the weld joint. The experiment was conducted on a 5 mm 6061 aluminum alloy sheet. Process parameters; tool material, rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial forces were utilized. Mechanical properties of the weld joint are examined employing a tensile test, and the maximum joint strength efficiency was reached 94.2%. Supervised Machine Learning based Regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms were used. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm yielded highest coefficient of determination value of 0.926 which means it gives a best fit in comparison to other algorithms.",

The identification of miRNA is a cross-disciplinary approach that requires both computational identification methods and wet-lab validation experiments, making it a resource-intensive procedure. While numerous machine learning methods have been developed to increase classification accuracy and thus reduce validation costs, most methods use supervised learning and thus require large labeled training data sets, often not feasible for less-sequenced species. On the other hand, there is now an abundance of unlabeled RNA sequence data due to the emergence of high-throughput wet-lab experimental procedures, such as next-generation sequencing.\n\n\nResults\nThis paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning for miRNA classification in order to maximize the utility of both labeled and unlabeled data. We here present the novel combination of two semi-supervised approaches: active learning and multi-view co-training. Results across six diverse species show that this multi-stage semi-supervised approach is able to improve classification performance using very small numbers of labeled instances, effectively leveraging the available unlabeled data.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed semi-supervised miRNA classification pipeline holds the potential to identify novel miRNA with high recall and precision while requiring very small numbers of previously known miRNA. Such a method could be highly beneficial when studying miRNA in newly sequenced genomes of niche species with few known examples of miRNA.\n",

However, existing graph learning-based image clustering focuses on grouping images under a single view, which under-utilises the information provided by the data. To address that, we propose a self-supervised multi-view image clustering technique under contrastive heterogeneous graph learning. Our method computes a heterogeneous affinity graph for multi-view image data. It conducts Local Feature Propagation (LFP) for reasoning over the local neighbourhood of each node and executes an Influence-aware Feature Propagation (IFP) from each node to its influential node for learning the clustering intention. The proposed framework pioneeringly employs two contrastive objectives. The first targets to contrast and fuse multiple views for the overall LFP embedding, and the second maximises the mutual information between LFP and IFP representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets for the problem, i.e.~COIL-20, Caltech7 and CASIA-WebFace. Our evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the popular techniques MVGL, MCGC and HeCo.",

The use of semi-supervised learning made it possible to label unlabeled data and thus ensure the creation of a labeled sample of sufficient size. The paper gives examples of generating a training sample, as well as its use for training neural networks, which are used to solve the problem of multiclass classification. Using this approach, you can get a robust data set consisting of a small amount of manually labeled images and a huge amount of pseudo-labeled or augmented data. Using this approach, one can train a classifier to detect and classify any objects in images with bounding boxes and label them accordingly.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveBy systematically scoring algorithms and integrating outbreak data through statistical learning, evaluate and improve the performance of automated infectious-disease-outbreak detection. The improvements should be directly relevant to the epidemiological practice. A broader objective is to explore the usefulness of machine-learning approaches in epidemiology.IntroductionWithin the traditional surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases in Germany, not only are individual cases reported to the Robert Koch Institute, but also outbreaks themselves are recorded: A label is assigned by epidemiologists to each case, indicating whether it is part of an outbreak and of which. This expert knowledge represents, in the language of machine leaning, a \"ground truth\" for the algorithmic task of detecting outbreaks from a stream of surveillance data. The integration of this kind of information in the design and evaluation of algorithms is called supervised learning.MethodsReported cases were aggregated weekly and divided into two count time series, one for endemic (not part of an outbreak) and one for epidemic cases. Two new algorithms were developed for the analysis of such time series: farringtonOutbreak is an adaptation of the standard method farringtonFlexible as implemented in the surveillance R package: It trains on endemic case counts but detects anomalies on total case counts. The second algorithm is hmmOutbreak, which is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM): A binary hidden state indicates whether an outbreak was reported in a given week, the transition matrix for this state is learned from the outbreak data and this state is integrated as factor in a generalised linear model of the total case count. An explicit probability of being in a state of outbreak is then computed for each week (one-week ahead) and a signal is generated if it is higher than a user-defined threshold.To evaluate performance, we framed outbreak detection as a simple binary classification problem: Is there an outbreak in a given week, yes or no? Was a signal generated for this week, yes or no? One can thus count, for each time series, the true positives (outbreak data and signals agree), false positives, true negatives and false negatives. From those, classical performance scores can be computed, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score or area under the ROC curve (AUC).For the evaluation with real-word data we used time series of reported cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis for each of the 412 German counties over 9 years. We also ran simple simulations with different parameter sets, generating count time series and outbreaks with the sim.pointSource function of the surveillance R package.ResultsWe have developed a supervised-learning framework for outbreak detection based on reported infections and outbreaks, proposing two algorithms and an evaluation method. hmmOutbreak performs overall much better than the standard farringtonFlexible, with e.g. a 60% improvement in sensitivity (0.5 compared to 0.3) at a fixed specificity of 0.9. The results were confirmed by simulations. Furthermore, the computation of explicit outbreak probabilities allows a better and clearer interpretation of detection results than the usual testing of the null hypothesis \"is endemic\".ConclusionsMethods of machine learning can be usefully applied in the context of infectious-disease surveillance. Already a simple HMM shows large improvements and better interpretability: More refined methods, in particular semi-supervised approaches, look thus very promising. The systematic integration of available expert knowledge, in this case the recording of outbreaks, allows an evaluation of algorithmic performance that is of direct relevance for the epidemiological practice, in contrast to the usual intrinsic statistical metrics. Beyond that, this knowledge can be readily used to improve that performance and, in the future, gain insights in outbreak dynamics. Moreover, other types of labels will be similarly integrated in automated surveillance analyses, e.g. user feedback on whether a signal was relevant (reinforcement learning) or messages on specialised internet platforms that were found to be useful warnings of international epidemic events.",

The ML models have for some time been utilized in numerous application spaces which required the distinguishing proof and prioritization of unfavorable variables for a danger. A few expectation techniques are in effect famously used to deal with estimating issues. This study shows the capacity of ML models to gauge the quantity of impending patients impacted by Coronavirus which is by and by considered as a possible danger to humankind. Specifically, four standard guaging models, like straight relapse (LR), least outright shrinkage and choice administrator (Tether), support vector machine (SVM), and outstanding smoothing (ES) have been utilized in this review to gauge the compromising elements of Coronavirus. Three kinds of expectations are made by every one of the models, like the quantity of recently contaminated cases, the quantity of passings, and the quantity of recuperations in the following 10 days. The outcomes created by the review demonstrates it a promising system to involve these strategies for the current situation of the Coronavirus pandemic. The outcomes demonstrate that the ES performs best among every one of the pre-owned models followed by LR and Tether which performs well in anticipating the new affirmed cases, demise rate as well as recuperation rate, while SVM performs ineffectively in all the forecast situations given the accessible dataset.",

With advances in sequencing technology thousands to millions of cells can be processed to understand the intricacies of the biological system in question. Annotation through manual curation of markers based on a priori knowledge is cumbersome given this exponential growth. There are currently ~200 computational tools available to help researchers automatically annotate single cells using supervised/unsupervised machine learning, cell type markers, or tissue-based markers from bulk RNA-seq. But with the expansion of publicly available data there is also a need for a tool which can help integrate multiple references into a unified atlas and understand how annotations between datasets compare. Here we present ELeFHAnt: Ensemble learning for harmonization and annotation of single cells. ELeFHAnt is an easy-to-use R package that employs support vector machine and random forest algorithms together to perform three main functions: 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship. CelltypeAnnotation is a function to annotate cells in a query Seurat object using a reference Seurat object with annotated cell types. LabelHarmonization can be utilized to integrate multiple cell atlases (references) into a unified cellular atlas with harmonized cell types. Finally, DeduceRelationship is a function that compares cell types between two scRNA-seq datasets. ELeFHAnt can be accessed from GitHub at https://github.com/praneet1988/ELeFHAnt.",

        "abstract": "The appearance of malicious apps is a serious threat to the Android platform. In this paper, we propose an effective and automatic malware detection method using the text semantics of network traffic. In particular, we consider each HTTP flow generated by mobile apps as a text document, which can be processed by natural language processing (NLP) to extract text-level features. Later, the use of network traffic is used to create a useful malware detection model. We examine the traffic flow header using the N-gram method from the NLP. Then, we propose an automatic feature selection algorithm based on the Chi-square test to identify meaningful features. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables. We propose a novel solution to perform malware detection using NLP methods by treating mobile traffic as documents. We apply an automatic feature selection algorithm based on the N-gram sequence to obtain meaningful features from the semantics of traffic flows. Our methods reveal some malware that can prevent the detection of antiviral scanners. In addition, we design a detection system to drive traffic to your own-institutional enterprise network, home network, and 3G/4G mobile network.

        "abstract": "Permeability models largely rely on core measurements as input. The propagation of these models beyond the cored interval is often by use of the empirical porosity-permeability relationship. The problem is that porosity itself does not contain information about the pore geometry which controls permeability, hence these relationships carry high uncertainty in uncored intervals and nearby wells. Dielectric dispersion, on the other hand, is inherently linked to the pore geometry since it is sensitive to charge build up at the rock-fluid interfaces of the interconnected pore network through the Maxwell-Wagner effect. We aim to utilize this connection between pore geometry and dielectric dispersion to predict permeability using a core-data trained supervised machine learning model on dielectric dispersion wireline logging arrays. It builds upon a previous single-well study (Norbisrath, 2018) where the main concern was the repeatability in other wells, which is now addressed here.  The study area is the Johan Sverdrup field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Data consists of core plug permeabilities and dielectric dispersion wireline logs from five wells. Capturing the dielectric frequency dispersion involves determining the slope of both attenuation and phase shift measurements made at different frequencies and transmitter-receiver spacings (feature engineering). The model will be trained on a subset of the core data (supervised machine learning), and subsequently propagated along the entire logged interval, as well as to the test well which was not part of the training set. Hyperparameter tuning will be used to optimize the model, and cross-validation used to prevent overfitting.  Preliminary results show that the dielectric dispersion logging data contains enough information about the pore geometry to accurately describe and predict core plug permeabilities, not only in the same well but also in nearby wells that were not used in training the model. Correlation coefficients between estimated and predicted core permeability values are around R = 0.8. Given additional training input data and ground truthing in other wells, the described method could potentially reduce the need for coring when dielectric dispersion wireline logs are run.  In the future we aim to explore the possibility of using dielectric dispersion data from LWD (Logging While Drilling) resistivity propagation tools as input for our permeability predictions. This would greatly enhance formation evaluation since these data are readily available in thousands of wells and are generally acquired in every new well. A model trained on a large amount of existing core data could enable real time permeability predictions from LWD tools.",

However, existing graph learning-based image clustering focuses on grouping images under a single view, which under-utilises the information provided by the data. To address that, we propose a self-supervised multi-view image clustering technique under contrastive heterogeneous graph learning. Our method computes a heterogeneous affinity graph for multi-view image data. It conducts Local Feature Propagation (LFP) for reasoning over the local neighbourhood of each node and executes an Influence-aware Feature Propagation (IFP) from each node to its influential node for learning the clustering intention. The proposed framework pioneeringly employs two contrastive objectives. The first targets to contrast and fuse multiple views for the overall LFP embedding, and the second maximises the mutual information between LFP and IFP representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets for the problem, i.e. COIL-20, Caltech7 and CASIA-WebFace. Our evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the popular techniques MVGL, MCGC and HeCo.",

        "abstract": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF classification model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. Our proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on our unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.</p>",

        "abstract": "Supervised learning operates on the premise that labels unambiguously represent ground truth. This premise is reasonable in domains wherein a high degree of consensus is easily possible for any given data record, e.g. in agreeing on whether an image contains an elephant or not. However, there are several domains wherein people disagree with each other on the appropriate label to assign to a record, e.g. whether a tweet is toxic. We argue that data labeling must be understood as a process with some degree of domain-dependent noise and that any claims of predictive prowess must be sensitive to the degree of this noise. We present a method for quantifying labeling noise in a particular domain wherein people are seen to disagree with their own past selves on the appropriate label to assign to a record: choices under prospect uncertainty. Our results indicate that `state-of-the-art' choice models of decisions from description, by failing to consider the intrinsic variability of human choice behavior, find themselves in the odd position of predicting humans' choices better than the same humans' own previous choices for the same problem. We conclude with observations on how the predicament we empirically demonstrate in our work could be handled in the practice of supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful method for extracting meaningful representations from vast, unlabeled datasets, already transforming computer vision and natural language processing. Similarly, in single-cell genomics (SCG), representation learning is well-recognized for offering insights into complex biological data, even more so by the advent of early foundation model approaches. However, despite these advancements, identifying scenarios in SCG where SSL outperforms traditional supervised or unsupervised learning methods remains a nuanced challenge. Furthermore, selecting the most effective pretext tasks within the SSL framework for SCG is a critical yet unresolved question. Here, we address this gap by adapting and benchmarking SSL techniques in SCG, including masked autoencoders with multiple masking strategies and contrastive learning approaches. Trained on over 20 million cells, this study rigorously examines multiple downstream tasks, including cell type prediction, gene expression reconstruction, cross-modality prediction, and data integration. Our empirical analyses underscore the nuanced role of SSL, namely in transfer learning scenarios leveraging auxiliary data or analyzing novel datasets. Masked autoencoders excel over contrastive methods in SCG, diverging from computer vision trends. Moreover, our findings reveal notable capabilities of SSL in zero-shot cell type prediction and offer insights into its potential benefits in cross-modality prediction and data integration. In summary, we study the application of SSL in SCG, minimizing model bias through simple, fully connected networks, and benchmark SSL's utility across key representation learning scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Accurate and timely occupancy prediction has the potential to improve the efficiency of energy management systems in smart buildings. Occupancy prediction heavily depends on historical occupancy-related data collected from various sensor sources. Unfortunately, a major problem in that context is the difficulty to collect training data. This situation inspired us to rethink the occupancy prediction problem, proposing the use of an original principled approach based on occupancy estimation via interactive learning to collect the needed training data. Following that, the collected data, along with various features, were fed into several algorithms to predict future occupancy. This paper mainly proposes a weakly supervised occupancy prediction framework based on office sensor readings and occupancy estimations derived from an interactive learning approach. Two studies are the main emphasis of this paper. The first is the prediction of three occupancy states, referred to as discrete states: absence, presence of one occupant, and presence of more than one occupant. The purpose of the second study is to anticipate the future number of occupants, i.e., continuous states. Extensive simulations were run to demonstrate the merits of the proposed prediction framework’s performance and to validate the interactive learning-based approach’s ability to contribute to the achievement of effective occupancy prediction. The results reveal that LightGBM, a machine learning model, is a better fit for short-term predictions than known recursive neural networks when dealing with a limited dataset. For a 24 h window forecast, LightGBM improved accuracy from 38% to 50%, which is an excellent result for non-aggregated data (single office).",

Objective: to show how we can distinguish ChatGPT-generated publications from counterparts produced by scientist. Methods:By means of a new algorithm, called xFakeBibs, we show the significant difference between ChatGPT-generated fake publications and real publications. Specifically, we triggered ChatGPT to generate 100 publications that were related to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and comorbidity. Using TF-IDF, using the real publications, we constructed a training network of bigrams comprised of 100 publications. Using 10-folds of 100 publications each, we also 10 calibrating networks to derive lower/upper bounds for classifying articles as real or fake. The final step was to test xFakeBibs against each of the ChatGPT-generated articles and predict its class. The algorithm successfully assigned the POSITIVE label for real ones and NEGATIVE for fake ones. Results: When comparing the bigrams of the training set against all the other 10 calibrating folds, we found that the similarities fluctuated between (19%-21%). On the other hand, the mere bigram similarity from the ChatGPT was only (8%). Additionally, when testing how the various bigrams generated from the calibrating 10-folds against ChatGPT we found that all 10 calibrating folds contributed (51%-70%) of new bigrams, while ChatGPT contributed only 23%, which is less than 50% of any of the other 10 calibrating folds. The final classification results using the xFakeBibs set a lower/upper bound of (21.96-24.93) number of new edges to the training mode without contributing new nodes. Using this calibration range, the algorithm predicted 98 of the 100 publications as fake, while 2 articles failed the test and were classified as real publications. Conclusions: This work provided clear evidence of how to distinguish, in bulk ChatGPT-generated fake publications from real publications. Also, we also introduced an algorithmic approach that detected fake articles with a high degree of accuracy. However, it remains challenging to detect all fake records. ChatGPT may seem to be a useful tool, but it certainly presents a threat to our authentic knowledge and real science. This work is indeed a step in the right direction to counter fake science and misinformation.",

        "abstract": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF classification model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. Our proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on our unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.</p>",

Lightweight materials and their joining processes are also a recent point of research demands in the manufacturing industries. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is one of the recent advancements for joining materials without adding any third material (filler rod) and joining below the melting point of the parent material. The process is widely used for joining similar and dissimilar metals, especially lightweight non-ferrous materials like aluminum, copper, and magnesium alloys. This paper presents verdicts of optimum process parameters on attaining enhanced mechanical properties of the weld joint. The experiment was conducted on a 5 mm 6061 aluminum alloy sheet. Process parameters; tool material, rotational speed, traverse speed, and axial forces were utilized. Mechanical properties of the weld joint are examined employing a tensile test, and the maximum joint strength efficiency was reached 94.2%. Supervised Machine Learning based Regression algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms were used. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm yielded highest coefficient of determination value of 0.926 which means it gives a best fit in comparison to other algorithms.",

The identification of miRNA is a cross-disciplinary approach that requires both computational identification methods and wet-lab validation experiments, making it a resource-intensive procedure. While numerous machine learning methods have been developed to increase classification accuracy and thus reduce validation costs, most methods use supervised learning and thus require large labeled training data sets, often not feasible for less-sequenced species. On the other hand, there is now an abundance of unlabeled RNA sequence data due to the emergence of high-throughput wet-lab experimental procedures, such as next-generation sequencing.\n\n\nResults\nThis paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning for miRNA classification in order to maximize the utility of both labeled and unlabeled data. We here present the novel combination of two semi-supervised approaches: active learning and multi-view co-training. Results across six diverse species show that this multi-stage semi-supervised approach is able to improve classification performance using very small numbers of labeled instances, effectively leveraging the available unlabeled data.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed semi-supervised miRNA classification pipeline holds the potential to identify novel miRNA with high recall and precision while requiring very small numbers of previously known miRNA. Such a method could be highly beneficial when studying miRNA in newly sequenced genomes of niche species with few known examples of miRNA.\n",

However, existing graph learning-based image clustering focuses on grouping images under a single view, which under-utilises the information provided by the data. To address that, we propose a self-supervised multi-view image clustering technique under contrastive heterogeneous graph learning. Our method computes a heterogeneous affinity graph for multi-view image data. It conducts Local Feature Propagation (LFP) for reasoning over the local neighbourhood of each node and executes an Influence-aware Feature Propagation (IFP) from each node to its influential node for learning the clustering intention. The proposed framework pioneeringly employs two contrastive objectives. The first targets to contrast and fuse multiple views for the overall LFP embedding, and the second maximises the mutual information between LFP and IFP representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets for the problem, i.e.~COIL-20, Caltech7 and CASIA-WebFace. Our evaluation shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, including the popular techniques MVGL, MCGC and HeCo.",

        "abstract": "ObjectiveBy systematically scoring algorithms and integrating outbreak data through statistical learning, evaluate and improve the performance of automated infectious-disease-outbreak detection. The improvements should be directly relevant to the epidemiological practice. A broader objective is to explore the usefulness of machine-learning approaches in epidemiology.IntroductionWithin the traditional surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases in Germany, not only are individual cases reported to the Robert Koch Institute, but also outbreaks themselves are recorded: A label is assigned by epidemiologists to each case, indicating whether it is part of an outbreak and of which. This expert knowledge represents, in the language of machine leaning, a \"ground truth\" for the algorithmic task of detecting outbreaks from a stream of surveillance data. The integration of this kind of information in the design and evaluation of algorithms is called supervised learning.MethodsReported cases were aggregated weekly and divided into two count time series, one for endemic (not part of an outbreak) and one for epidemic cases. Two new algorithms were developed for the analysis of such time series: farringtonOutbreak is an adaptation of the standard method farringtonFlexible as implemented in the surveillance R package: It trains on endemic case counts but detects anomalies on total case counts. The second algorithm is hmmOutbreak, which is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM): A binary hidden state indicates whether an outbreak was reported in a given week, the transition matrix for this state is learned from the outbreak data and this state is integrated as factor in a generalised linear model of the total case count. An explicit probability of being in a state of outbreak is then computed for each week (one-week ahead) and a signal is generated if it is higher than a user-defined threshold.To evaluate performance, we framed outbreak detection as a simple binary classification problem: Is there an outbreak in a given week, yes or no? Was a signal generated for this week, yes or no? One can thus count, for each time series, the true positives (outbreak data and signals agree), false positives, true negatives and false negatives. From those, classical performance scores can be computed, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score or area under the ROC curve (AUC).For the evaluation with real-word data we used time series of reported cases of salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis for each of the 412 German counties over 9 years. We also ran simple simulations with different parameter sets, generating count time series and outbreaks with the sim.pointSource function of the surveillance R package.ResultsWe have developed a supervised-learning framework for outbreak detection based on reported infections and outbreaks, proposing two algorithms and an evaluation method. hmmOutbreak performs overall much better than the standard farringtonFlexible, with e.g. a 60% improvement in sensitivity (0.5 compared to 0.3) at a fixed specificity of 0.9. The results were confirmed by simulations. Furthermore, the computation of explicit outbreak probabilities allows a better and clearer interpretation of detection results than the usual testing of the null hypothesis \"is endemic\".ConclusionsMethods of machine learning can be usefully applied in the context of infectious-disease surveillance. Already a simple HMM shows large improvements and better interpretability: More refined methods, in particular semi-supervised approaches, look thus very promising. The systematic integration of available expert knowledge, in this case the recording of outbreaks, allows an evaluation of algorithmic performance that is of direct relevance for the epidemiological practice, in contrast to the usual intrinsic statistical metrics. Beyond that, this knowledge can be readily used to improve that performance and, in the future, gain insights in outbreak dynamics. Moreover, other types of labels will be similarly integrated in automated surveillance analyses, e.g. user feedback on whether a signal was relevant (reinforcement learning) or messages on specialised internet platforms that were found to be useful warnings of international epidemic events.",

The ML models have for some time been utilized in numerous application spaces which required the distinguishing proof and prioritization of unfavorable variables for a danger. A few expectation techniques are in effect famously used to deal with estimating issues. This study shows the capacity of ML models to gauge the quantity of impending patients impacted by Coronavirus which is by and by considered as a possible danger to humankind. Specifically, four standard guaging models, like straight relapse (LR), least outright shrinkage and choice administrator (Tether), support vector machine (SVM), and outstanding smoothing (ES) have been utilized in this review to gauge the compromising elements of Coronavirus. Three kinds of expectations are made by every one of the models, like the quantity of recently contaminated cases, the quantity of passings, and the quantity of recuperations in the following 10 days. The outcomes created by the review demonstrates it a promising system to involve these strategies for the current situation of the Coronavirus pandemic. The outcomes demonstrate that the ES performs best among every one of the pre-owned models followed by LR and Tether which performs well in anticipating the new affirmed cases, demise rate as well as recuperation rate, while SVM performs ineffectively in all the forecast situations given the accessible dataset.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAnnotation of single cells has become an important step in the single cell analysis framework. With advances in sequencing technology thousands to millions of cells can be processed to understand the intricacies of the biological system in question. Annotation through manual curation of markers based on a priori knowledge is cumbersome given this exponential growth. There are currently ~200 computational tools available to help researchers automatically annotate single cells using supervised/unsupervised machine learning, cell type markers, or tissue-based markers from bulk RNA-seq. But with the expansion of publicly available data there is also a need for a tool which can help integrate multiple references into a unified atlas and understand how annotations between datasets compare. Here we present ELeFHAnt: Ensemble learning for harmonization and annotation of single cells. ELeFHAnt is an easy-to-use R package that employs support vector machine and random forest algorithms together to perform three main functions: 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship. CelltypeAnnotation is a function to annotate cells in a query Seurat object using a reference Seurat object with annotated cell types. LabelHarmonization can be utilized to integrate multiple cell atlases (references) into a unified cellular atlas with harmonized cell types. Finally, DeduceRelationship is a function that compares cell types between two scRNA-seq datasets. ELeFHAnt can be accessed from GitHub at https://github.com/praneet1988/ELeFHAnt.",

In this paper, we propose an effective and automatic malware detection method using the text semantics of network traffic. In particular, we consider each HTTP flow generated by mobile apps as a text document, which can be processed by natural language processing (NLP) to extract text-level features. Later, the use of network traffic is used to create a useful malware detection model. We examine the traffic flow header using the N-gram method from the NLP. Then, we propose an automatic feature selection algorithm based on the Chi-square test to identify meaningful features. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables. We propose a novel solution to perform malware detection using NLP methods by treating mobile traffic as documents. We apply an automatic feature selection algorithm based on the N-gram sequence to obtain meaningful features from the semantics of traffic flows. Our methods reveal some malware that can prevent the detection of antiviral scanners.

        "abstract": "Permeability models largely rely on core measurements as input. The propagation of these models beyond the cored interval is often by use of the empirical porosity-permeability relationship. The problem is that porosity itself does not contain information about the pore geometry which controls permeability, hence these relationships carry high uncertainty in uncored intervals and nearby wells. Dielectric dispersion, on the other hand, is inherently linked to the pore geometry since it is sensitive to charge build up at the rock-fluid interfaces of the interconnected pore network through the Maxwell-Wagner effect. We aim to utilize this connection between pore geometry and dielectric dispersion to predict permeability using a core-data trained supervised machine learning model on dielectric dispersion wireline logging arrays. It builds upon a previous single-well study (Norbisrath, 2018) where the main concern was the repeatability in other wells, which is now addressed here.  The study area is the Johan Sverdrup field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Data consists of core plug permeabilities and dielectric dispersion wireline logs from five wells. Capturing the dielectric frequency dispersion involves determining the slope of both attenuation and phase shift measurements made at different frequencies and transmitter-receiver spacings (feature engineering). The model will be trained on a subset of the core data (supervised machine learning), and subsequently propagated along the entire logged interval, as well as to the test well which was not part of the training set. Hyperparameter tuning will be used to optimize the model, and cross-validation used to prevent overfitting.  Preliminary results show that the dielectric dispersion logging data contains enough information about the pore geometry to accurately describe and predict core plug permeabilities, not only in the same well but also in nearby wells that were not used in training the model. Correlation coefficients between estimated and predicted core permeability values are around R = 0.8. Given additional training input data and ground truthing in other wells, the described method could potentially reduce the need for coring when dielectric dispersion wireline logs are run.  In the future we aim to explore the possibility of using dielectric dispersion data from LWD (Logging While Drilling) resistivity propagation tools as input for our permeability predictions. This would greatly enhance formation evaluation since these data are readily available in thousands of wells and are generally acquired in every new well. A model trained on a large amount of existing core data could enable real time permeability predictions from LWD tools.",

However, existing graph learning-based image clustering focuses on grouping images under a single view, which under-utilises the information provided by the data. To address that, we propose a self-supervised multi-view image clustering technique under contrastive heterogeneous graph learning. Our method computes a heterogeneous affinity graph for multi-view image data. It conducts Local Feature Propagation (LFP) for reasoning over the local neighbourhood of each node and executes an Influence-aware Feature Propagation (IFP) from each node to its influential node for learning the clustering intention. The proposed framework pioneeringly employs two contrastive objectives. The first targets to contrast and fuse multiple views for the overall LFP embedding, and the second maximises the mutual information between LFP and IFP representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets for the problem, i.e. COIL-20, Caltech7 and CASIA-WebFace.

        "abstract": "<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF classification model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. Our proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on our unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.</p>",

        "abstract": "Supervised learning operates on the premise that labels unambiguously represent ground truth. This premise is reasonable in domains wherein a high degree of consensus is easily possible for any given data record, e.g. in agreeing on whether an image contains an elephant or not. However, there are several domains wherein people disagree with each other on the appropriate label to assign to a record, e.g. whether a tweet is toxic. We argue that data labeling must be understood as a process with some degree of domain-dependent noise and that any claims of predictive prowess must be sensitive to the degree of this noise. We present a method for quantifying labeling noise in a particular domain wherein people are seen to disagree with their own past selves on the appropriate label to assign to a record: choices under prospect uncertainty. Our results indicate that `state-of-the-art' choice models of decisions from description, by failing to consider the intrinsic variability of human choice behavior, find themselves in the odd position of predicting humans' choices better than the same humans' own previous choices for the same problem. We conclude with observations on how the predicament we empirically demonstrate in our work could be handled in the practice of supervised learning.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful method for extracting meaningful representations from vast, unlabeled datasets, already transforming computer vision and natural language processing. Similarly, in single-cell genomics (SCG), representation learning is well-recognized for offering insights into complex biological data, even more so by the advent of early foundation model approaches. However, despite these advancements, identifying scenarios in SCG where SSL outperforms traditional supervised or unsupervised learning methods remains a nuanced challenge. Furthermore, selecting the most effective pretext tasks within the SSL framework for SCG is a critical yet unresolved question. Here, we address this gap by adapting and benchmarking SSL techniques in SCG, including masked autoencoders with multiple masking strategies and contrastive learning approaches. Trained on over 20 million cells, this study rigorously examines multiple downstream tasks, including cell type prediction, gene expression reconstruction, cross-modality prediction, and data integration. Our empirical analyses underscore the nuanced role of SSL, namely in transfer learning scenarios leveraging auxiliary data or analyzing novel datasets. Masked autoencoders excel over contrastive methods in SCG, diverging from computer vision trends. Moreover, our findings reveal notable capabilities of SSL in zero-shot cell type prediction and offer insights into its potential benefits in cross-modality prediction and data integration. In summary, we study the application of SSL in SCG, minimizing model bias through simple, fully connected networks, and benchmark SSL's utility across key representation learning scenarios.",

This situation inspired us to rethink the occupancy prediction problem, proposing the use of an original principled approach based on occupancy estimation via interactive learning to collect the needed training data. Following that, the collected data, along with various features, were fed into several algorithms to predict future occupancy. This paper mainly proposes a weakly supervised occupancy prediction framework based on office sensor readings and occupancy estimations derived from an interactive learning approach. Two studies are the main emphasis of this paper. The first is the prediction of three occupancy states, referred to as discrete states: absence, presence of one occupant, and presence of more than one occupant. The purpose of the second study is to anticipate the future number of occupants, i.e., continuous states. Extensive simulations were run to demonstrate the merits of the proposed prediction framework’s performance and to validate the interactive learning-based approach’s ability to contribute to the achievement of effective occupancy prediction. The results reveal that LightGBM, a machine learning model, is a better fit for short-term predictions than known recursive neural networks when dealing with a limited dataset. For a 24 h window forecast, LightGBM improved accuracy from 38% to 50%, which is an excellent result for non-aggregated data (single office).",

A privacy-friendly learning framework can help to ease the tensions, and to free up more data for research. We propose a new algorithm, LESS (Learning with Empirical feature-based Summary statistics from Semi-supervised data), which uses only summary statistics instead of raw data for regression learning. The selection of empirical features serves as a trade-off between prediction precision and the protection of privacy. We show that LESS achieves the minimax optimal rate of convergence in terms of the size of the labeled sample. LESS extends naturally to the applications where data are separately held by different sources. Compared with the existing literature on distributed learning, LESS removes the restriction of minimum sample size on single data sources. ",

The human face contains a lot of information, including face shape, skin color, eye shape, nose shape, mouth shape, and some additional attributes such as beard, mustache, hair, and eyebrows. This biometric information can be used to obtain further information regarding the human identity itself. In this study, sample data of human faces aged 20 to 30 years were used. The purpose of this study is to classify gender in human facial images using masks, while the algorithm used uses supervised learning. The research process carried out was collecting human face sample data, conducting training stages which included face resizing, storing data in arrays, feature extraction using faceNet, training data and gender models. Perform testing stages which include video data acquisition, video extraction into frames, video frames, face detection, facial image resixing, storing data in arrays, feature extraction using faceNet and prediction of gender determination. The benefits of this research can provide information in determining the gender of human faces with masks, apply the application of supervised learning algorithms to processing human face images and can be applied to face detection on highways, public areas and shopping centers. Based on testing using the K-NN method, the train accuracy value is above 87% and the test accuracy is above 96%. Testing using the SVM method obtained train accuracy above 99% and test accuracy above 98%. Tests using the random forest method obtained 100% train accuracy and test accuracy above 88%.",

Forecasting airline fares poses a significant and intricate challenge due to their continual fluctation, influenced by a diverse array of factores. Extensive research suggests that the application of Machine Learning, and Deep Learing techniques enables the swift estimation of flight fares at specific intervals. This study employs a Machine Learning Regression methodology to predict flight fares based on essential parameters such as departure and arrival times, departure location, destination, stopovers, and airline provider. This research employs two distinct datasets for training and testing purposes, evaluating a range of machine learning approaches to forecast flight ticket prices.",

Although the spike-timing\nbased neuronal codes have significant computational advantages over rate encoding scheme, the\nexact spike timing-based learning mechanism in the brain remains an open question. To close this\ngap, many weight-based supervised learning algorithms have been proposed for spiking neural\nnetworks. However, it is insufficient to consider only synaptic weight plasticity, and biological\nevidence suggest that the synaptic delay plasticity also plays an important role in the learning\nprogress in biological neural networks. Recently, many learning algorithms have been proposed to\nconsider both the synaptic weight plasticity and synaptic delay plasticity. The goal of this paper is\nto give an overview of the existing synaptic delay-based learning algorithms in spiking neural\nnetworks. We described the typical learning algorithms and reported the experimental results.\nFinally, we discussed the properties and limitations of each algorithm and made a comparison\namong them.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSeismic reflectivity inversion is a critical component in subsurface characterization, playing an indispensable role in resource exploration and reservoir studies (Tarantola, 1984). Conventional inversion methods have traditionally relied on optimization-based techniques, which often necessitate prior low-frequency models, and are not only susceptible to noise but also prone to introducing biases due to their dependence on initial assumptions.\nIn recent years, deep learning, using deep neural networks (DNNs), has emerged as a competitive approach for seismic inversion, capable of capturing complex relationships within data (Valentine & Trampert, 2012). However, supervised deep learning models are heavily dependent on the availability of labeled data, which is not always abundant or easily attainable (Alaudah & AlRegib, 2019). Furthermore, many existing models focus on predicting single points in reflectivity series, not adequately accounting for broader contexts within the seismic data (Wu et al., 2019).\nIn this study, we present a novel semi-supervised deep learning approach for seismic reflectivity inversion that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to produce high quality reflectivity estimates. Our model employs a sequence-to-sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014) architecture, operating directly on raw seismic data, and is capable of capturing broader contexts, thus ensuring the continuity and complexity of the reflectivity series. Additionally, it minimizes the reliance on prior low-frequency models, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method through a series of experiments on synthetic datasets, contrasting its performance against conventional seismic inversion and supervised DNN methods. Moreover, we discuss the key advantages, potential limitations, and avenues for future research in the application of semi-supervised deep learning in seismic inversion.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAnnotation of cell-types is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that allows the study of heterogeneity across multiple cell populations. Currently this is most commonly done using unsupervised clustering algorithms, which project single-cell expression data into a lower dimensional space and then cluster cells based on their distances from each other. However, as these methods do not use reference datasets, they can only achieve a rough classification of cell-types, and it is difficult to improve the recognition accuracy further. To effectively solve this issue we propose a novel supervised annotation method, scDeepInsight. The scDeepInsight method is capable of performing manifold assignments. It is competent in executing data integration through batch normalization, performing supervised training on the reference dataset, doing outlier detection and annotating cell-types on query datasets. Moreover, it can help identify active genes or marker genes related to cell-types. The training of the scDeepInsight model is performed in a unique way. Tabular scRNA-seq data are first converted to corresponding images through the DeepInsight methodology. DeepInsight can create a trainable image transformer to convert non-image RNA data to images by comprehensively comparing interrelationships among multiple genes. Subsequently, the converted images are fed into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as EfficientNet-b3. This enables automatic feature extraction to identify the cell-types of scRNA-seq samples. We benchmarked scDeepInsight with six other mainstream cell annotation methods. The average accuracy rate of scDeepInsight reached 87.5%, which is more than 7% higher compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Most previous studies of ABSA focused on explicit aspects, but implicit aspects have not yet been the subject of much attention. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised method for implicit aspect extraction, which is a task to classify a sentence into a pre-defined implicit aspect category. A dataset labeled with implicit aspects is automatically constructed from unlabeled sentences as follows. First, explicit sentences are obtained by extracting explicit aspects from unlabeled sentences, while sentences that do not contain explicit aspects are preserved as candidates of implicit sentences. Second, clustering is performed to merge the explicit and implicit sentences that share the same aspect. Third, the aspect of the explicit sentence is assigned to the implicit sentences in the same cluster as the implicit aspect label. Then, the BERT model is fine-tuned for implicit aspect extraction using the constructed dataset. The results of the experiments show that our method achieves 82% and 84% accuracy for mobile phone and PC reviews, respectively, which are 20 and 21 percentage points higher than the baseline.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to robustly monitor shelves in retail stores using supervised learning for improving on-shelf availability. To ensure high on-shelf availability, which is a key factor for improving profits in retail stores, we focus on understanding changes in products regarding increases/decreases in product amounts on the shelves. Our method first detects changed regions of products in an image by using background subtraction followed by moving object removal. It then classifies the detected change regions into several classes representing the actual changes on the shelves, such as “product taken (decrease)” and “product replenished/returned (increase)”, by supervised learning using convolutional neural networks. It finally updates the shelf condition representing the presence/absence of products using classification results and computes the product amount visible in the image as on-shelf availability using the updated shelf condition. Three experiments were conducted using two videos captured from a surveillance camera on the ceiling in a real store. Results of the first and second experiments show the effectiveness of the product change classification in our method. Results of the third experiment show that our method achieves a success rate of 89.6% for on-shelf availability when an error margin is within one product. With high accuracy, store clerks can maintain high on-shelf availability, enabling retail stores to increase profits.",

        "abstract": "When deriving fluid equations from the Vlasov equation for collisionless plasmas, one runs into the so-called closure problem: each equation for the temporal evolution of one particle moment (density, current, pressure, heat flux, &#8230;) includes terms depending on the next order moment. Therefore, when choosing to truncate the description at the nth order, one must approximate the terms related to the (n+1)th order moment included in the evolution equation for the nth order moment. The order at which the hierarchy is closed and the assumption behind the approximations used determine how accurately a fluid description can reproduce kinetic processes.In this work, we aim at reconstructing specific particle moments from kinetic simulations, using as input the electric and magnetic field and the lower moments. We use fully kinetic Particle In Cell simulations, where all physical information is available, as the ground truth. The approach we present here uses supervised machine learning to enable a neural network to learn how to reconstruct higher moments from lower moments and fields.Starting from the work of Laperre et al., 2022 we built a framework which makes it possible to train feedforward multilayer perceptrons on kinetic simulations to learn to predict the higher moments of the Vlasov equation from the lower moments, which would also be available in fluid simulations. We train on simulations of magnetic reconnection in a double Harris current sheet with varying background guide field obtained with the semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell code iPiC3D (Markidis et al, 2010). We test the influence of data preprocessing techniques, of (hyper-)parameter variations and of different architectures of the neural networks on the quality of the predictions that are produced. Furthermore, we investigate which metrics are most useful to evaluate the quality of the outcome.",

The false information that is embedded in the infodemic affects people&rsquo;s ability to have access to safety and follow proper procedures to mitigate the risks.

The NeoNet algorithm is trained by noun-phrases features which contributes a network model. The algorithm was tested on a real-world dataset and predicted the label of never-seem articles and flags ones that are suspicious or disputed. In five different fold comparisons, NeoNet surpassed prominent contemporary algorithm such as Neural Networks, SVM, and Random Forests. The analysis shows that the NeoNet algorithm predicts a label of an article with a 100% precision using a non-pruned model. This highlights the promise of detecting disputed online contents that may contribute negatively to the COVID-19 pandemic.

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nDeep learning models have shown great success in automating tasks in sleep medicine by learning from carefully annotated electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, effectively using a large amount of raw EEG data remains a challenge.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nIn this study, we aim to learn robust vector representations from massive unlabeled EEG signals, such that the learned vectorized features (1) are expressive enough to replace the raw signals in the sleep staging task, and (2) provide better predictive performance than supervised models in scenarios involving fewer labels and noisy samples.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe propose a self-supervised model, Contrast with the World Representation (ContraWR), for EEG signal representation learning. Unlike previous models that use a set of negative samples, our model uses global statistics (ie, the average representation) from the data set to distinguish signals associated with different sleep stages. The ContraWR model is evaluated on 3 real-world EEG data sets that include both settings: at-home and in-laboratory EEG recording.\n\n\nRESULTS\nContraWR outperforms 4 recently reported self-supervised learning methods on the sleep staging task across 3 large EEG data sets. ContraWR also supersedes supervised learning when fewer training labels are available (eg, 4% accuracy improvement when less than 2% of data are labeled on the Sleep EDF data set). Moreover, the model provides informative, representative feature structures in 2D projection.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe show that ContraWR is robust to noise and can provide high-quality EEG representations for downstream prediction tasks. The proposed model can be generalized to other unsupervised physiological signal learning tasks. Future directions include exploring task-specific data augmentations and combining self-supervised methods with supervised methods, building upon the initial success of self-supervised learning reported in this study.\n",

Hence, the proposed model can be efficiently deployed and used to discover in-vehicle alcohol with high accuracy and low inference overhead as a part of the driver alcohol detection system for safety (DADSS) system aiming at the massive deployment of alcohol-sensing systems that could potentially save thousands of lives annually.",

        "abstract": "Engineered nanoparticles are advantageous for numerous biotechnology applications, including biomolecular sensing and delivery. However, testing the compatibility and function of nanotechnologies in biological systems requires a heuristic approach, where unpredictable biofouling via protein corona formation often prevents effective implementation. Moreover, rational design of biomolecule-nanoparticle conjugates requires prior knowledge of such interactions or extensive experimental testing. Toward better applying engineered nanoparticles in biological systems, herein, we develop a random forest classifier (RFC) trained with proteomic mass spectrometry data that identifies proteins that adsorb to nanoparticles, based solely on the protein's amino acid sequence. We model proteins that populate the corona of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT)-based optical nanosensor and study whether there is a relationship between the protein's amino acid-based properties and the protein's adsorption to SWCNTs. We optimize the classifier and characterize the classifier performance against other models. To evaluate the predictive power of our model, we apply the classifier to rapidly identify proteins with high binding affinity to SWCNTs, followed by experimental validation. We further determine protein features associated with increased likelihood of SWCNT binding: high content of solvent-exposed glycine residues and non-secondary structure-associated amino acids. Conversely, proteins with high content of leucine residues and beta-sheet-associated amino acids are less likely to form the SWCNT protein corona. The classifier presented herein provides a step toward undertaking the otherwise intractable problem of predicting protein-nanoparticle interactions, which is needed for more rapid and effective translation of nanobiotechnologies from in vitro synthesis to in vivo use.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of electric vehicles (EV) has to be complemented with the right charging infrastructure roll-out. This infrastructure is already in place in many cities throughout the main markets of China, EU and USA. Public policies are both taken at regional and/or at a city level targeting both EV adoption, but also charging infrastructure management. A growing trend is the increasing idle time over the years (time an EV is connected without charging), which directly impacts on the sizing of the infrastructure, hence its cost or availability. Such a phenomenon can be regarded as an opportunity but may very well undermine the same initiatives being taken to promote adoption; in any case it must be measured, studied, and managed. The time an EV takes to charge depends on its initial/final state of charge (SOC) and the power being supplied to it. The problem however is to estimate the time the EV remains parked after charging (idle time), as it depends on many factors which simple statistical analysis cannot tackle. In this study we apply supervised machine learning to a dataset from the Netherlands and analyze three regression algorithms, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, identifying the most accurate one and main influencing parameters. The model can provide useful information for EV users, policy maker and network owners to better manage the network, targeting specific variables. The best performing model is XGBoost with an R2 score of 60.32% and mean absolute error of 1.11. The parameters influencing the model the most are: The time of day in which the charging sessions start and the total energy supplied with 22.35%, 15.57% contribution respectively. Partial dependencies of variables and model performances are presented and implications on public policies discussed.",

The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify geographic cause and effect.",

        "abstract": "Data scarcity poses a significant challenge in medical image segmentation, thereby highlighting the importance of leveraging sparse annotation data. In addressing this issue, semi-supervised learning has emerged as an effective approach for training neural networks using limited labeled data. In this study, we introduced a curriculum consistency constraint within the context of semi-supervised medical image segmentation, thus drawing inspiration from the human learning process. By dynamically comparing patch features with full image features, we enhanced the network’s ability to learn. Unlike existing methods, our approach adapted the patch size to simulate the human curriculum process, thereby progressing from easy to hard tasks. This adjustment guided the model toward improved convergence optima and generalization. Furthermore, we employed multi-scale contrast learning to enhance the representation of features. Our method capitalizes on the features extracted from multiple layers to explore additional semantic information and point-wise representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on the Kvasir-SEG polyp dataset and the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that our method surpassed state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by achieving a 9.2% increase in the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the Kvasir-SEG dataset. This improvement substantiated the efficacy of our proposed curriculum consistency constraint and multi-scale contrastive loss.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn clinical neuroscience, the segmentation of the main white matter bundles is propaedeutic for many tasks such as pre-operative neurosurgical planning and monitoring of neuro-related diseases. Automating bundle segmentation with data-driven approaches and deep learning models has shown promising accuracy in the context of healthy individuals. The lack of large clinical datasets is preventing the translation of these results to patients. Inference on patients’ data with models trained on healthy population is not effective because of domain shift. This study aims to carry out an empirical analysis to investigate how transfer learning might be beneficial to overcome these limitations. For our analysis, we consider a public dataset with hundreds of individuals and a clinical dataset with several tens of glioma patients. We focus our preliminary investigation on the corticospinal tract. The results show that transfer learning might be effective in partially overcoming the domain shift.",

It will prove to be very important to medicine for the diagnosis of heart diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. If such predictions give good results with sufficient accuracy, we can not only avoid inaccurate diagnoses, but also save unnecessary resources. When a patient who does not have heart disease is diagnosed positively, he panics unnecessarily, and when a patient who does have heart disease and is neither diagnosed with heart disease nor has a negative result, he dies will involuntarily miss a chance to cure his illness. Such misdiagnosis is detrimental to both patients and hospitals. With more accurate predictions, we can overcome unnecessary problems.",

However, challenges remain regarding leveraging advanced deep learning methods in BCIs. We focus on problems of small-sized training samples and interpretability of the learned parameters and leverages a semi-supervised generative and discriminative learning framework that effectively utilizes synthesized samples with real samples to discover class-discriminative features. Our framework learns the distributional characteristics of EEG signals in an embedding space using a generative model. By using artificially generated and real EEG signals, our framework finds class-discriminative spatio-temporal feature representations that help to correctly discriminate input EEG signals. It is noteworthy that the framework facilitates the exploitation of real, unlabeled samples to better uncover the underlying patterns inherent in a user’s EEG signals. To validate our framework, we conducted experiments comparing our method with conventional linear models by utilizing variants of three existing CNN architectures as generator networks and measuring the performance on three public datasets. Our framework exhibited statistically significant improvements over the competing methods. We investigated the learned network via activation pattern maps and visualized generated artificial samples to empirically justify the stability and neurophysiological plausibility of our model.",

However, individual cells in patient-derived tissues are in different pathological stages, and hence such cellular variability impedes subsequent differential gene expression analyses.ResultTo overcome such heterogeneity issue, we present a novel deep learning approach, scIDST, that infers disease progressive levels of individual cells with weak supervision framework. The inferred disease progressive cells displayed significant differential expression of disease-relevant genes, which could not be detected by comparative analysis between patients and healthy donors. In addition, we demonstrated that pre-trained models by scIDST are applicable to multiple independent data resources, and advantageous to infer cells related to certain disease risks and comorbidities.ConclusionTaken together, scIDST offers a new strategy of single-cell sequencing analysis to identify bona fide disease-associated molecular features.",

However, evolutionary algorithm based supervised learning for SNN has not been investigated thoroughly which is still in embryo stage. This paper introduce an efficient algorithm (SpiFoG) to train multilayer feed forward SNN in supervised manner that uses elitist floating point genetic algorithm with hybrid crossover. The evidence from neuroscience claims that the brain uses spike times with random synaptic delays for information processing. Therefore, leaky-integrate-and-fire spiking neuron is used in this research introducing random synaptic delays. The SpiFoG allows both excitatory and inhibitory neurons by allowing a mixture of positive and negative synaptic weights. In addition, random synaptic delays are also trained with synaptic weights in an efficient manner. Moreover, computational efficiency of SpiFoG was increased by reducing the total simulation time and increasing the time step since increasing time step within the total simulation time takes less iteration. The SpiFoG is benchmarked on Iris and WBC dataset drawn from the UCI machine learning repository and found better performance than state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundWhole genome sequencing resolves many clinical cases where standard diagnostic methods have failed. However, at least half of these cases remain unresolved after whole genome sequencing. Structural variants (SVs; genomic variants larger than 50 base pairs) of uncertain significance are the genetic cause of a portion of these unresolved cases. As sequencing methods using long or linked reads become more accessible and structural variant detection algorithms improve, clinicians and researchers are gaining access to thousands of reliable SVs of unknown disease relevance. Methods to predict the pathogenicity of these SVs are required to realize the full diagnostic potential of long-read sequencing.ResultsTo address this emerging need, we developed StrVCTVRE to distinguish pathogenic SVs from benign SVs that overlap exons. In a random forest classifier, we integrated features that capture gene importance, coding region, conservation, expression, and exon structure. We found that features such as expression and conservation are important but are absent from SV classification guidelines. We leveraged multiple resources to construct a size-matched training set of rare, putatively benign and pathogenic SVs. StrVCTVRE performs accurately across a wide SV size range on independent test sets, which will allow clinicians and researchers to eliminate about half of SVs from consideration while retaining a 90% sensitivity.ConclusionsWe anticipate clinicians and researchers will use StrVCTVRE to prioritize SVs in patients where no SV is immediately compelling, empowering deeper investigation into novel SVs to resolve cases and understand new mechanisms of disease. StrVCTVRE runs rapidly and is available athttps://compbio.berkeley.edu/proj/strvctvre/.",

However, this problem is quite challenging due to the lack of location supervision. To address this issue, this paper integrates saliency into a deep architecture, in which the location information is explored both explicitly and implicitly. Specifically, we select highly confident object proposals under the guidance of class-specific saliency maps. The location information, together with semantic and saliency information, of the select proposals are then used to explicitly supervise the network by imposing two additional losses. Meanwhile, a saliency prediction sub-network is built in the architecture. The prediction results are used to implicitly guide the localization procedure. The entire network is trained end-to-end. Experiments on PASCAL VOC demonstrate that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-arts.",

        "abstract": "Given recent advances in deep learning, semi-supervised techniques have seen a rise in interest. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent one recent approach to semi-supervised learning (SSL). This paper presents a survey method using GANs for SSL. Previous work in applying GANs to SSL are classified into pseudo-labeling/classification, encoder-based, TripleGAN-based, two GAN, manifold regularization, and stacked discriminator approaches. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of the various approaches is presented. The R3-CGAN architecture is identified as the GAN architecture with state-of-the-art results. Given the recent success of non-GAN-based approaches for SSL, future research opportunities involving the adaptation of elements of SSL into GAN-based implementations are also identified.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has proven effective for various application tasks, but its applicability is limited by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising direction to alleviate the supervision bottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences in unlabeled data for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked language model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific self-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate noisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic (DPL), which offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels as latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision using probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational EM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision (S4), which adds to DPL the capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of structured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based active learning). Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical machine reading and various text classification tasks show that task-specific self-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and often match the accuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.",

The conventional diagnosis of NERD needs the endoscopic examination, biopsy of the lining of the esophagus (mucosa), and ambulatory pH testing over 24 to 96 hours, which is complex and time-consuming. To address this problem, a computer-aided diagnosis system for NERD (named NERD-CADS) has been proposed in our previous paper. The NERD-CADS offers a more convenient and efficient approach to diagnosing NERD, which only requires the input of endoscopic images into the computer to produce a nearly instant diagnostic result. The NERD-CADS uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a classifier and can classify the endoscopic images captured in the esophagus of both healthy people and NERD patients. This is, in fact, a classification problem of two classes: non-NERD and NERD. We conduct ten-fold cross-validation to verify the classification accuracy of the NERD-CADS. The experiment shows that the mean of ten-fold classification accuracy of the NERD-CADS test reaches 77.8%. In this paper, we aim to improve the classification accuracy of the NERD-CADS. We add the contrastive self-supervised learning as an additional component to the NERD-CADS (named NERD-CADS-CSSL), and investigate whether it can learn the capability of extracting representations to improve the classification accuracy. This paper combines the contrastive self-supervised learning with transfer learning, which first employs massive public image data to train the CNN by the contrastive self-supervised learning, and then uses the endoscopic images to fine-tune the CNN. In this way, the capability of extracting representations (learned by the contrastive self-supervised learning) can be transferred into the downstream task (NERD diagnosis). The experiment shows that the NERD-CADS-CSSL can obtain a higher mean (80.6%) in tests than the NERD-CADS (77.8%).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 virus spread from China throughout the world, causing out of control challenges to the public health community. During the epidemic, it is difficult to act against infectious disease due to its unknown trends, so the spread prediction becomes difficult in light of the scarce data. With the absence of treatment for COVID-19 infection, countries have taken some mitigation steps and policies, such as general lockdown and social distance measures, but there has been variation in the extent of viral spread due to several additional factors. Prediction methods based on Artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can help in suggesting new policies or even assessing the effectiveness of the existing ones. Such methods have attracted wide attention from researchers implementing statistical modeling and machine learning methods. The objective of this study is to examine different supervised classification approaches to detect the degrees of possibility of Coronavirus disease infection in different countries. Naïve Bayesian Classifier (NBC), Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network classification (ANN) are machine learning algorithms used for the prediction of coronavirus disease cases according to the time of their evolution while considering data collected from official reports and scientific journals. Since we collected mixed data, we suggested to also apply the supervised classifiers available for mixed data, such as Extended Gamma (EG) and Naive Associative Classifier (NAC). The results showed that ANN and DTC supervised algorithms allow better discrimination between the degrees of possibility of Coronavirus disease infection among advanced methods like NBC, SVM, NAC, EG and LDA.",

        "abstract": "Project schedule forecasting is a core enabler of successful project management. Accurate schedule prediction leads to better resource management and ultimately, more value gained from the investment made for the project. The higher the complexity of the project, the higher the importance of having an accurate schedule prediction to minimize the risks associated with the project. The Field X Expansion Project of Company Y provided an excellent case study of the successful pilot implementation of supervised machine learning to predict the completion of the project tasks, which gave more precise results compared to the existing conservative approach. The Field X Expansion Project was designed to increase the total daily production from the gigantic Field X reservoir. The project’s cost was in the multi-billion dollars range, making it one of the highest investments of the decade in the oil and gas industry. Therefore, it is crucial to complete the project on schedule and within the budget to maintain its economic value. However, there were multiple challenges in the project that brought uncertainties and complexities to the schedule prediction, which cannot be solved using the conservative approach, such as the challenges in the project terrain and geography, the weather, and the mobilization of project logistics from around the globe. The conservative approach utilizing the off-the-shelf project management software has attempted to forecast past projects schedule more accurately. With this software, each project task and its estimated duration serve as inputs for the software to calculate the estimated project completion. To the team’s disappointment, the result showed overall schedule accuracy of only 40%. Moreover, using this method, the software can only calculate the estimated completion of the whole project, not the completion of the individual tasks. Although useful, it can still be improved. The software has been able to accumulate historical data from many previous projects utilizing this approach to be used as a data source for further improvement. With the advancement of data science technology and the immense amount of accumulated data from previous projects, there is an opportunity to leverage more advanced analytics methods such as big data analytics and machine learning to predict task completion with higher accuracy.   This paper discusses the big data analytics approach to predicting individual project task completion. The method involved pulling the task data from the project management software database and analyzing the impact of various variables and features of the project on the completion of the individual project tasks that ultimately affected the project schedule. The features with the most significant impact were then used as predictors to forecast the completion of each project task. Applying this method to the Field X Expansion Project, the task completion can be predicted with 98.6% accuracy and 90% Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC AUC). This result is higher than the baseline accuracy of 40% applying the conservative approach. With the new accuracy, the project quality is improving, thus avoiding the loss of millions of dollars from poor project management.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe development and evaluation of energy efficiency measures to reduce air emissions from shipping strongly depends on reliable description of a ship’s performance when sailing at sea. Normally, model tests and semi-empirical formulas are used to model a ship’s performance but they are either expensive or lack accuracy. Nowadays, a lot of ship performance-related parameters have been recorded during a ship’s sailing, and different data driven machine learning methods have been applied for the ship speed-power modelling. This paper compares different supervised machine learning algorithms, i.e., eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), neural network, support vector machine, and some statistical regression methods, for the ship speed-power modelling. A worldwide sailing chemical tanker with full-scale measurements is employed as the case study vessel. A general data pre-processing method for the machine learning is presented. The machine learning models are trained using measurement data including ship operation profiles and encountered metocean conditions. Through the benchmark study, the pros and cons of different machine learning methods for the ship’s speed-power performance modelling are identified. The accuracy of various algorithms based models for ship performance during individual voyages is also investigated.",

Similarity transformation introduces the fluidic system of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A dataset is generated based on squeezing fluid flow system USF-IPP for the LMBNN through the Runge-Kutta method by the suitable variations of Reynolds number and volume flow rate. TO attain approximation solutions for USF-IPP to different scenarios and cases of LMBNN, the operations of training, testing, and validation are prepared and then the outcomes are compared with the reference data set to ensure the suggested model's accuracy. The output of LMBNN is discussed by the mean square error, dynamics of state transition, analysis of error histograms, and regression illustrations.",

In previous work, we developed an algorithm for mapping both smallholder and commercial agricultural fields that includes efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. In this paper, we demonstrated how active learning can be incorporated in the algorithm to create smaller, more efficient training data sets, which reduced computational resources, minimized the need for humans to hand-label data, and boosted performance. We designed a patch-based uncertainty metric to drive the active learning framework, based on the regular grid of a crowdsourcing platform, and demonstrated how subject matter experts can be replaced with fleets of crowdsourcing workers. Our active learning algorithm achieved similar performance as an algorithm trained with randomly selected data, but with 62% less data samples.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method called Grouped Contrastive Learning of self-supervised Sentence Representation (GCLSR), which can learn an effective and meaningful representation of sentences. Previous works maximize the similarity between two vectors to be the objective of contrastive learning, suffering from the high-dimensionality of the vectors. In addition, most previous works have adopted discrete data augmentation to obtain positive samples and have directly employed a contrastive framework from computer vision to perform contrastive training, which could hamper contrastive training because text data are discrete and sparse compared with image data. To solve these issues, we design a novel framework of contrastive learning, i.e., GCLSR, which divides the high-dimensional feature vector into several groups and respectively computes the groups’ contrastive losses to make use of more local information, eventually obtaining a more fine-grained sentence representation. In addition, in GCLSR, we design a new self-attention mechanism and both a continuous and a partial-word vector augmentation (PWVA). For the discrete and sparse text data, the use of self-attention could help the model focus on the informative words by measuring the importance of every word in a sentence. By using the PWVA, GCLSR can obtain high-quality positive samples used for contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GCLSR achieves an encouraging result on the challenging datasets of the semantic textual similarity (STS) task and transfer task.",

The output of predictive program maintenance is data, this treatment includes the type of \"condition based maintenance\" where changes in the condition of the machine or equipment are detected so that proactive actions are taken before the occurrence of machine damage. The K-nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that is used to solve problems based on classification and regression. K-NN works by finding the query distance and all database examples, selecting a certain number of examples (K) adjacent to the query, then selecting the frequent label (in classification) or the average label (in regression). The purpose of this algorithm is to classify new object conditions based on attributes and samples from the training database. So that a predictive analysis is carried out on the damage to generating equipment using the machine learning application method of the Nearest Neighbor type or the classification of conditions used to predict the age or condition of an equipment by modeling according to the standard Operation & Maintenance of equipment. By doing predictive analysis, maintenance will lead to condition based maintenance so that the KPI (Key Performance Indicator) of operating performance in the form of increasing values, such as Capacity Factor (CF), Equivalent Availbility Factor (EAF) becomes optimal and prevents the generator from tripping suddenly. which is called sudden outage frequency (SdOF), as well as more efficient maintenance costs.",

Higher spatial resolution can also be achieved using deconvolution, but conventional deconvolution approaches amplify noise. We develop a CNN that mitigates increasing noise and that does not require higher-resolution reference images.MethodsOur model includes a noise reduction CNN and a deconvolution CNN that are separately trained. The noise reduction CNN is a U-Net, similar to other noise reduction CNNs found in the literature. The deconvolution CNN uses an autoencoder, where the decoder is fixed and provided as a hyperparameter that represents the system point spread function. The encoder is trained to provide a deconvolution that does not amplify noise. Ringing can occur from deconvolution but is controlled with a difference of gradients loss function term. Our technique was demonstrated on a variety of patient images and on ex vivo kidney stones.ResultsThe noise reduction and deconvolution CNNs produced visually sharper images at low noise. In ex vivo mixed kidney stones, better visual delineation of the kidney stone components could be seen.ConclusionsA noise reduction and deconvolution CNN improves spatial resolution and reduces noise without requiring higher-resolution reference images.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised clustering typically relies on both labeled and unlabeled data to guide the learning process towards the optimal data partition and to prevent falling into local minima. However, researchers’ efforts made to improve existing semi-supervised clustering approaches are relatively scarce compared to the contributions made to enhance the state-of-the-art fully unsupervised clustering approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep clustering approach, named Soft Constrained Deep Clustering (SC-DEC), that aims to address the limitations exhibited by existing semi-supervised clustering approaches. Specifically, the proposed approach leverages a deep neural network architecture and generates fuzzy membership degrees that better reflect the true partition of the data. In particular, the proposed approach uses side-information and formulates it as a set of soft pairwise constraints to supervise the machine learning process. This supervision information is expressed using rather relaxed constraints named “should-link” constraints. Such constraints determine whether the pairs of data instances should be assigned to the same or different cluster(s). In fact, the clustering task was formulated as an optimization problem via the minimization of a novel objective function. Moreover, the proposed approach’s performance was assessed via extensive experiments using benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach was compared to relevant state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, and the obtained results demonstrate the impact of using minimal previous knowledge about the data in improving the overall clustering performance.",

        "abstract": "Canonical procedures to control the false discovery rate (FDR) among the list of putative discoveries rely on our ability to compute informative p-values. Competition-based approach offers a fairly novel and increasingly popular alternative when computing such p-values is impractical. The popularity of this approach stems from its wide applicability: instead of computing p-values, which requires knowing the entire null distribution for each null hypothesis, a competition-based approach only requires a single draw from each such null distribution. This drawn example is known as a \"decoy\" in the mass spectrometry community (which was the first to adopt the competition approach) or as a \"knockoff\" in the statistics community. The decoy is competed with the original observation so that only the higher scoring of the two is retained. The number of decoy wins is subsequently used to estimate and control the FDR among the target wins. In this paper we offer a novel method to extend the competition-based approach to control the FDR while taking advantage of side information, i.e., additional features that can help us distinguish between correct and incorrect discoveries. Our motivation comes from the problem of peptide detection in tandem mass spectrometry proteomics data. Specifically, we recently showed that a popular mass spectrometry analysis software tool, Percolator, can apparently fail to control the FDR. We address this problem here by developing a general protocol called \"RESET\" that can take advantage of the additional features, such as the ones Percolator uses, while still theoretically and empirically controlling the FDR.",

Early and precise physiological measurement-based prediction of breathing will minimize the risk of COVID-19 by a reasonable distance from anyone; wearing a mask, cleanliness, medication, balanced diet, and if not well stay safe at home. To evaluate the collected datasets of COVID-19 prediction, five machine learning classifiers were used: Nave Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Decision Tree. COVID-19 datasets from the Repository were combined and re-examined to remove incomplete entries, and a total of 2500 cases were utilized in this study. Features of fever, body pain, runny nose, difficulty in breathing, shore throat, and nasal congestion, are considered to be the most important differences between patients who have COVID-19s and those who do not. We exhibit the prediction functionality of five machine learning classifiers. A publicly available data set was used to train and assess the model. With an overall accuracy of 99.88 percent, the ensemble model is performed commendably. When compared to the existing methods and studies, the proposed model is performed better. As a result, the model presented is trustworthy and can be used to screen COVID-19 patients timely, efficiently.",

The main step in these methods is to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. However, in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the augmentation methods used in creating similar pairs with regard to contrastive learning (CL) assumptions are challenging. This is because, even simply modifying a word in the input might change the semantic meaning of the sentence, and hence, would violate the distributional hypothesis. In this review paper, we formalize the contrastive learning framework, emphasize the considerations that need to be addressed in the data transformation step, and review the state-of-the-art methods and evaluations for contrastive representation learning in NLP. Finally, we describe some challenges and potential directions for learning better text representations using contrastive methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Single particle soot photometers (SP2) use laser-induced incandescence to detect aerosols on a single particle basis. Both refractory black carbon (rBC) and other light absorbing metallic aerosols, including iron oxides (FeOx), have been characterized by the SP2, but single particles cannot be unambiguously identified from their incandescent peak height (a function of particle mass) and color ratio (a measure of blackbody temperature) alone. Machine learning offers a promising approach to improving the classification of these aerosols. Here we explore the advantages and limitations of classifying single particle signals obtained with the SP2 using a supervised learning algorithm. Laboratory samples of different aerosols that incandesce in the SP2 (fullerene soot, mineral dust, volcanic ash, coal fly ash, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4) were used to train a random forest algorithm. The trained algorithm was then applied to test data sets of laboratory samples and atmospheric aerosols. This method provides a systematic approach for classifying incandescent aerosols by providing a score, or conditional probability, that a particle is likely to belong to a particular aerosol class (rBC, FeOx, etc.) given its observed single-particle features. We consider two alternative approaches for identifying aerosols in mixed populations: one with specific class labels for each species sampled, and one with three broader classes for aerosols with similar properties. While the specific class approach performs well for rBC and Fe3O4 (> = 99 % of these aerosols are correctly identified), its classification of other aerosol types is significantly worse (only 47–66 % of other particles are correctly identified). Using the broader class approach, we find a classification accuracy of 99 % for FeOx samples measured in the laboratory. The method allows for classification of FeOx as anthropogenic or dust-like for aerosols with effective spherical diameters from 170 to > 1200 nm. The misidentification of both dust-like aerosols and rBC as anthropogenic FeOx is small, with \n                        ",

In previous work, we developed an algorithm for mapping both smallholder and commercial agricultural fields that includes efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. In this paper, we demonstrated how active learning can be incorporated in the algorithm to create smaller, more efficient training data sets, which reduced computational resources, minimized the need for humans to hand-label data, and boosted performance. We designed a patch-based uncertainty metric to drive the active learning framework, based on the regular grid of a crowdsourcing platform, and demonstrated how subject matter experts can be replaced with fleets of crowdsourcing workers. Our active learning algorithm achieved similar performance as an algorithm trained with randomly selected data, but with 62% less data samples.",

        "abstract": "The training of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models requires a substantial amount of labeled data. Unfortunately, despite being trained on enormous datasets, most current models have poor performance rates when evaluated against anonymous data from new users. Furthermore, due to the limits and problems of working with human users, capturing adequate data for each new user is not feasible. This paper presents semi-supervised adversarial learning using the LSTM (Long-short term memory) approach for human activity recognition. This proposed method trains annotated and unannotated data (anonymous data) by adapting the semi-supervised learning paradigms on which adversarial learning capitalizes to improve the learning capabilities in dealing with errors that appear in the process. Moreover, it adapts to the change in human activity routine and new activities, i.e., it does not require prior understanding and historical information. Simultaneously, this method is designed as a temporal interactive model instantiation and shows the capacity to estimate heteroscedastic uncertainty owing to inherent data ambiguity. Our methodology also benefits from multiple parallel input sequential data predicting an output exploiting the synchronized LSTM. The proposed method proved to be the best state-of-the-art method with more than 98% accuracy in implementation utilizing the publicly available datasets collected from the smart home environment facilitated with heterogeneous sensors. This technique is a novel approach for high-level human activity recognition and is likely to be a broad application prospect for HAR.",

        "abstract": "The principal reason for measuring mental workload is to quantify the cognitive cost of performing tasks to predict human performance. Unfortunately, a method for assessing mental workload that has general applicability does not exist yet. This is due to the abundance of intuitions and several operational definitions from various fields that disagree about the sources or workload, its attributes, the mechanisms to aggregate these into a general model and their impact on human performance. This research built upon these issues and presents a novel method for mental workload modelling from EEG data employing deep learning. This method is self-supervised, employing a continuous brain rate, an index of cognitive activation, and does not require human declarative knowledge. The aim is to induce models automatically from data, supporting replicability, generalisability and applicability across fields and contexts. This specific method is a convolutional recurrent neural network trainable with spatially preserving spectral topographic head-maps from EEG data, aimed at fitting a novel brain rate variable. Findings demonstrate the capacity of the convolutional layers to learn meaningful high-level representations from EEG data since within-subject models had, on average, a test Mean Absolute Percentage Error of around 11%. The addition of a Long-Short Term Memory layer for handling sequences of high-level representations was not significant, although it did improve their accuracy. These findings point to the existence of quasi-stable blocks of automatically learnt high-level representations of cognitive activation because they can be induced through convolution and seem not to be dependent on each other over time, intuitively matching the non-stationary nature of brain responses. Additionally, across-subject models, induced with data from an increasing number of participants, thus trained with data containing more variability, obtained a similar accuracy to the within-subject models. This highlights the potential generalisability of the induced high-level representations across people, suggesting the existence of subject-independent cognitive activation patterns. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing scholars with a novel computational method for mental workload modelling that aims to be generally applicable and does not rely on ad hoc human crafted models.",

Subsequently, publication counts applying machine learning methods have risen, with different data modalities, mathematically distinct models, and samples of varying size being used to train and test models with the promise of clinical translation. Consequently, and in part due to the preliminary nature of such works, many studies have reported largely varying degrees of accuracy, raising concerns over systematic overestimation and methodological inconsistencies. Furthermore, a lack of procedural evaluation guidelines for non-expert medical professionals and funding bodies leaves many in the field with no means to systematically evaluate the claims, maturity, and clinical readiness of a project. Given the potential of machine learning methods to transform patient care, albeit, contingent on the rigor of employed methods and their dissemination, we deem it necessary to provide a review of current methods, recommendations, and future directions for applied machine learning in psychiatry. In this review we will cover issues of best practice for model training and evaluation, sources of systematic error and overestimation, model explainability vs. trust, the clinical implementation of AI systems, and finally, future directions for our field.",

Further, to allow for sample- and label-efficient policy learning from small datasets, BTIL employs a Bayesian perspective and is capable of learning from semi-supervised demonstrations. We demonstrate and benchmark the performance of BTIL on synthetic multi-agent tasks as well as a novel dataset of human-agent teamwork.

Even though the field produces a massive number of cards, they come with no label or interpretation about the pump conditions based on the card shape. Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists of a pretext task that trains feature extractors by using unlabeled data as opposed to supervised learning, that requires a lot of effort in labeling data which is time consuming and costly. This paper evaluates the performance of a feature extractor, Alexnet, that is trained by using several pretext task techniques. This study used around 660,000 unlabeled cards while a small amount of labeled data was used for evaluation purposes using linear evaluation protocol. The result showed that the trained Alexnet using Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) with jigsaw has better performance by 6% compared to the pre-trained ImageNet model. Further fine-tuning process by using labeled data could achieve 93% accuracy. The model was also tested using fresh data and the result was compared to the expert's interpretation. This approach can potentially add more types of rod pump problems to detect in the Duri field with considerable precision. In addition, the new approach could improve the current method of detecting more SRP with valve leaking problems.",

Extending the concept of a confusion matrix, we present a “trade information matrix” to attribute the expected profit and loss of the high‐frequency strategy under execution constraints, such as fill probabilities and position dependent trade rules, to correct and incorrect predictions. We apply the trade execution model and trade information matrix to Level II E‐mini S&P 500 futures history and demonstrate an estimation approach for measuring the sensitivity of the P&L to the error of a recurrent neural network. Our approach directly evaluates the performance sensitivity of a market‐making strategy to prediction error and augments traditional market simulation‐based testing.",

        "abstract": "Transfer learning is a technique utilized in deep learning applications to transmit learned inference to a different target domain. The approach is mainly to solve the problem of a few training datasets resulting in model overfitting, which affects model performance. The study was carried out on publications retrieved from various digital libraries such as SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, which formed the Primary studies. Secondary studies were retrieved from Primary articles using the backward and forward snowballing approach. Based on set inclusion and exclusion parameters, relevant publications were selected for review. The study focused on transfer learning pretrained NLP models based on the deep transformer network. BERT and GPT were the two elite pretrained models trained to classify global and local representations based on larger unlabeled text datasets through self-supervised learning. Pretrained transformer models offer numerous advantages to natural language processing models, such as knowledge transfer to downstream tasks that deal with drawbacks associated with training a model from scratch. This review gives a comprehensive view of transformer architecture, self-supervised learning and pretraining concepts in language models, and their adaptation to downstream tasks. Finally, we present future directions to further improvement in pretrained transformer-based language models.",

We first explore descriptive statistics for the dataset and deal with missing values. After that, we examine some widely used classification methods, including logistic regression, discriminant analysis, support vector machine, random forest, and boosting. Meanwhile, we also provide suitable R functions to demonstrate applications. Various metrics such as ROC curves, accuracy, recall and F-measure are calculated to compare the performance of these models. We find the boosting is the best method in our data analysis due to its highest AUC value and the highest prediction accuracy. In addition, among all predictor variables, we also find three variables that have the largest impact on the US adult income level.",

In this work, we propose belief propagation networks (BPN), a novel approach to train a deep neural network in a hard inductive setting, where the test data are given without neighborhood information. BPN uses a differentiable classifier to compute the prior distributions of nodes, and then diffuses the priors through the graphical structure, independently from the prior computation. This separable structure improves the generalization performance of BPN for isolated test instances, compared with previous approaches that jointly use the feature and neighborhood without distinction. As a result, BPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in four datasets with an average margin of 2.4% points in accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Automatic ship detection provides an essential function towards maritime domain awareness for security or economic monitoring purposes. This work presents an approach for training a deep learning ship detector in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images with few labeled examples. We design a network architecture for detecting ships with a backbone that can be pre-trained separately. By using self supervised learning, an emerging unsupervised training procedure, we learn good features on Sentinel-2 images, without requiring labeling, to initialize our network’s backbone. The full network is then fine-tuned to learn to detect ships in challenging settings. We evaluated this approach versus pre-training on ImageNet and versus a classical image processing pipeline. We examined the impact of variations in the self-supervised learning step and we show that in the few-shot learning setting self-supervised pre-training achieves better results than ImageNet pre-training. When enough training data are available, our self-supervised approach is as good as ImageNet pre-training. We conclude that a better design of the self-supervised task and bigger non-annotated dataset sizes can lead to surpassing ImageNet pre-training performance without any annotation costs.",

        "abstract": "Noise is ever present in seismic data and arises from numerous sources and is continually evolving, both spatially and temporally. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of seismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of noise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in characteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised, blind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on the raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise assumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence of even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks has been shown to efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it cannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network’s ability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise properties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a frugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised manner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal leakage observed, using a semi-synthetic example we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the self-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This is further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network strikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction. Finally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for the supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior geological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for the dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network should recording conditions change, to name a few. Such benefits result in a robust denoising procedure suited for long term, passive seismic monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection has recently received much attention, since it only requires image-level labels instead of the bounding-box labels consumed in strongly supervised learning. Nevertheless, the save in labeling expense is usually at the cost of model accuracy.In this paper, we propose a simple but effective weakly supervised collaborative learning framework to resolve this problem, which trains a weakly supervised learner and a strongly supervised learner jointly by enforcing partial feature sharing and prediction consistency. For object detection, taking WSDDN-like architecture as weakly supervised detector sub-network and Faster-RCNN-like architecture as strongly supervised detector sub-network, we propose an end-to-end Weakly Supervised Collaborative Detection Network. As there is no strong supervision available to train the Faster-RCNN-like sub-network, a new prediction consistency loss is defined to enforce consistency of predictions between the two sub-networks as well as within the Faster-RCNN-like sub-networks. At the same time, the two detectors are designed to partially share features to further guarantee the model consistency at perceptual level. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nObjectives/Scope\nIn oil and natural gas exploration, Machine Learning (ML) has gained noteworthy prominence for its ability to decode complex subsurface geology. ML commonly applies advanced statistical algorithms to build robust predictive regression and classification models. On-land Bengal Basin tasted exploratory success recently but displays great ordeal of stratigraphic heterogeneity. This paper discusses application of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and self-organizing map (SOM) ML algorithms with supervisions towards comprehensive modeling of the complex Miocene facies from Bengal on-land area for the maiden time, difficult otherwise by subjective conventional approach.\n\n\nMethods, Procedures, Process\nAdvanced geochemical logs (such as Elemental Capture Spectroscopy, ECS) and core data usually are very useful to quantify the facies downhole. However their availability also demands increased operation time and cost. Whenever available such data can be treated seamlessly with ML to test and build quantitative facies classification model from limited resources to over a region. Facies classification by ML not only makes the most of the available data but also eliminates the undesired subjectivity in addressing the subsurface heterogeneity with higher confidence. Gamma Ray, Neutron-Density, Resistivity, Sonic derived P-wave & S-wave velocities and suitably engineered log derivatives are mathematically modeled from the study area to classify facies using SVM, RF and SOM ML algorithms with ECS and core data calibration.\n\n\nResults, Observations, Conclusions\nMiocene sediments of the study area shows presence of six distinct facies viz. Claystone, Silty Claystone, Clayey Sand, Sandy Clay, Sand and Clean Sand. Facies data are trained by ML algorithms with multifold cross validation and returns credible accuracy for SVM, RF and SOM. The statistics driven facies model has been extrapolated for area where ECS or core data are not available but common logs are and yields geologically acceptable outputs. During exploration and field development stages such ML driven quantitative facies model improves the understanding of the subsurface from reservoir and non-reservoir point of view. ML Facies modeling captures the transition from shelf to fluvial depositional environment in the study area. Association frequency of different facies helps to visualize the changes from low/transitional to higher energy regime on a fine scale within Miocene.\n\n\nNovel/Additive Information\nThis paper discusses appropriate workflow, SVM kernel selection and hyper-parameter optimizations for SVM, RF and SOM that dictate the quality of facies model for Bengal basin. Heterogeneous stratigraphic play of Bengal on-land area demands accurate and quantitative subsurface lithological understanding for deploying fine exploration and development strategies, which can be addressed by this study. Nonetheless RF/SVM appear to be better facies classifier than SOM for Miocene sediments of Bengal from overall classification accuracy especially for less populous facies and calculation time.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractI use a novel supervised ensemble machine learning approach to verify sex estimation of archaeological skeletons from central Italian bioarchaeological contexts with large amounts of missing data present. Eighteen cranial interlandmark distances and five maxillary metric distances were recorded from n = 240 estimated males and n = 180 estimated females from four locations at Alfedena (600-400 BCE) and two locations at Campovalano (750-200 BCE and 9-11th Century CE). A generalized low rank model (GLRM) was used to impute missing data and 20-fold external stratified cross-validation was used to fit an ensemble of eight machine learning algorithms to six different subsets of the data: 1) the face, 2) vault, 3) cranial base, 4) combined face/vault/base, 5) dentition, and 6) combined cranianiodental. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive performance of six constituent algorithms, the discrete algorithmic winner(s), and the SuperLearner weighted ensemble’s classification of males and females from these six bony regions. This approach is useful for predicting male/female sex from central Italy. AUC for the combined craniodental data was the highest (0.9722), followed by the combined cranial data (0.9644), the face (0.9426), vault (0.9116), base (0.9060), and dentition (0.7421). Cross-validated ensemble machine learning of cranial and dental data shows strong potential for estimating sex in the bioarchaeological record and can contribute additional perspectives to help refine our understanding of human sex estimation. Additionally, GLRMs have the potential to handle missing data in ways previously unexplored in the discipline. The main limitation is that the biological sexes of the individuals estimated in this study are not certain, but were estimated macroscopically using common bioarchaeological methods. However, these methods show great promise for estimation of sex in bioarchaeological and forensic contexts and should be investigated on known-sex reference samples for confirmation.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has become an increasingly ubiquitous technology, as big data continues to inform and influence everyday life and decision-making. Currently in healthcare, as well as in most other industries, the two most prevalent machine learning paradigms are supervised learning and transfer learning. Both practices rely on large-scale, manually annotated datasets to train increasingly complex models. However, the requirement of data to be manually labeled leaves an excess of unused, unlabeled data available in both public and private data repositories. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a growing area of machine learning that has the ability to take advantage of unlabeled data. Contrary to other machine learning paradigms, SSL algorithms create artificial supervisory signals from unlabeled data and pretrain algorithms on these signals. The aim of this review is two-fold: firstly, we provide a formal definition of SSL, divide SSL algorithms into their four unique subsets, and review the state-of-the-art published in each of those subsets between the years of 2014-2020. Second, this work surveys recent SSL algorithms published in healthcare, in order to provide medical experts with a clearer picture of how they can integrate SSL into their research, with the objective of leveraging unlabeled data.",

Leveraging the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset's high-resolution, global, and bias-corrected data, we compare various machine learning regression algorithms. Focusing on the EC Earth3 model, our approach involves an in-depth analysis of five weather variables closely tied to daily rainfall. We employed a diverse set of algorithms, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), random forest regression, decision tree regression, AdaBoost, extra tree regression, extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBoost), support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT), and multi-layer perceptron. Performance evaluation highlights the superior predictive capabilities of Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and KNN, achieving an impressive RMSE score of 0.04 and an accuracy score of 0.99. In contrast, XGBoost exhibits lower performance metrics, with an RMSE score of 5.1 and an accuracy score of 0.49, indicating poor rainfall prediction. This study contributes in advancing rainfall prediction models, hence emphasizing the improvement of methodological choices in harnessing machine learning for climate research.",

        "abstract": "AbstractCOVID-19, a recently declared pandemic by WHO has taken the world by storm causing catastrophic damage to human life. The novel cornonavirus disease was first incepted in the Wuhan city of China on 31st December 2019. The symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Since the devastating phenomenon is essentially a time-series representation, accurate modeling may benefit in identifying the root cause and accelerate the diagnosis. In the current analysis, COVID-19 modeling is done for the Indian subcontinent based on the data collected for the total cases confirmed, daily recovered, daily deaths, total recovered and total deaths. The data is treated with total confirmed cases as the target variable and rest as feature variables. It is observed that Support vector regressions yields accurate results followed by Polynomial regression. Random forest regression results in overfitting followed by poor Bayesian regression due to highly correlated feature variables. Further, in order to examine the effect of neighbouring countries, Pearson correlation matrix is computed to identify geographic cause and effect.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThere has been a lot of research on supervised learning in spiking neural network (SNN) for a couple of decades to improve computational efficiency. However, evolutionary algorithm based supervised learning for SNN has not been investigated thoroughly which is still in embryo stage. This paper introduce an efficient algorithm (SpiFoG) to train multilayer feed forward SNN in supervised manner that uses elitist floating point genetic algorithm with hybrid crossover. The evidence from neuroscience claims that the brain uses spike times with random synaptic delays for information processing. Therefore, leaky-integrate-and-fire spiking neuron is used in this research introducing random synaptic delays. The SpiFoG allows both excitatory and inhibitory neurons by allowing a mixture of positive and negative synaptic weights. In addition, random synaptic delays are also trained with synaptic weights in an efficient manner. Moreover, computational efficiency of SpiFoG was increased by reducing the total simulation time and increasing the time step since increasing time step within the total simulation time takes less iteration. The SpiFoG is benchmarked on Iris and WBC dataset drawn from the UCI machine learning repository and found better performance than state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "abstract": "Data scarcity poses a significant challenge in medical image segmentation, thereby highlighting the importance of leveraging sparse annotation data. In addressing this issue, semi-supervised learning has emerged as an effective approach for training neural networks using limited labeled data. In this study, we introduced a curriculum consistency constraint within the context of semi-supervised medical image segmentation, thus drawing inspiration from the human learning process. By dynamically comparing patch features with full image features, we enhanced the network’s ability to learn. Unlike existing methods, our approach adapted the patch size to simulate the human curriculum process, thereby progressing from easy to hard tasks. This adjustment guided the model toward improved convergence optima and generalization. Furthermore, we employed multi-scale contrast learning to enhance the representation of features. Our method capitalizes on the features extracted from multiple layers to explore additional semantic information and point-wise representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on the Kvasir-SEG polyp dataset and the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that our method surpassed state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by achieving a 9.2% increase in the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the Kvasir-SEG dataset. This improvement substantiated the efficacy of our proposed curriculum consistency constraint and multi-scale contrastive loss.",

If such predictions give good results with sufficient accuracy, we can not only avoid inaccurate diagnoses, but also save unnecessary resources.

However, challenges remain regarding leveraging advanced deep learning methods in BCIs. We focus on problems of small-sized training samples and interpretability of the learned parameters and leverages a semi-supervised generative and discriminative learning framework that effectively utilizes synthesized samples with real samples to discover class-discriminative features. Our framework learns the distributional characteristics of EEG signals in an embedding space using a generative model. By using artificially generated and real EEG signals, our framework finds class-discriminative spatio-temporal feature representations that help to correctly discriminate input EEG signals. It is noteworthy that the framework facilitates the exploitation of real, unlabeled samples to better uncover the underlying patterns inherent in a user’s EEG signals. To validate our framework, we conducted experiments comparing our method with conventional linear models by utilizing variants of three existing CNN architectures as generator networks and measuring the performance on three public datasets. Our framework exhibited statistically significant improvements over the competing methods. We investigated the learned network via activation pattern maps and visualized generated artificial samples to empirically justify the stability and neurophysiological plausibility of our model.",

Automating bundle segmentation with data-driven approaches and deep learning models has shown promising accuracy in the context of healthy individuals. The lack of large clinical datasets is preventing the translation of these results to patients. Inference on patients’ data with models trained on healthy population is not effective because of domain shift. This study aims to carry out an empirical analysis to investigate how transfer learning might be beneficial to overcome these limitations. For our analysis, we consider a public dataset with hundreds of individuals and a clinical dataset with several tens of glioma patients. We focus our preliminary investigation on the corticospinal tract. The results show that transfer learning might be effective in partially overcoming the domain shift.",

However, individual cells in patient-derived tissues are in different pathological stages, and hence such cellular variability impedes subsequent differential gene expression analyses.ResultTo overcome such heterogeneity issue, we present a novel deep learning approach, scIDST, that infers disease progressive levels of individual cells with weak supervision framework. The inferred disease progressive cells displayed significant differential expression of disease-relevant genes, which could not be detected by comparative analysis between patients and healthy donors. In addition, we demonstrated that pre-trained models by scIDST are applicable to multiple independent data resources, and advantageous to infer cells related to certain disease risks and comorbidities.ConclusionTaken together, scIDST offers a new strategy of single-cell sequencing analysis to identify bona fide disease-associated molecular features.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundWhole genome sequencing resolves many clinical cases where standard diagnostic methods have failed. However, at least half of these cases remain unresolved after whole genome sequencing. Structural variants (SVs; genomic variants larger than 50 base pairs) of uncertain significance are the genetic cause of a portion of these unresolved cases. As sequencing methods using long or linked reads become more accessible and structural variant detection algorithms improve, clinicians and researchers are gaining access to thousands of reliable SVs of unknown disease relevance. Methods to predict the pathogenicity of these SVs are required to realize the full diagnostic potential of long-read sequencing.ResultsTo address this emerging need, we developed StrVCTVRE to distinguish pathogenic SVs from benign SVs that overlap exons. In a random forest classifier, we integrated features that capture gene importance, coding region, conservation, expression, and exon structure. We found that features such as expression and conservation are important but are absent from SV classification guidelines. We leveraged multiple resources to construct a size-matched training set of rare, putatively benign and pathogenic SVs. StrVCTVRE performs accurately across a wide SV size range on independent test sets, which will allow clinicians and researchers to eliminate about half of SVs from consideration while retaining a 90% sensitivity.ConclusionsWe anticipate clinicians and researchers will use StrVCTVRE to prioritize SVs in patients where no SV is immediately compelling, empowering deeper investigation into novel SVs to resolve cases and understand new mechanisms of disease. StrVCTVRE runs rapidly and is available athttps://compbio.berkeley.edu/proj/strvctvre/.",

However, this problem is quite challenging due to the lack of location supervision. To address this issue, this paper integrates saliency into a deep architecture, in which the location information is explored both explicitly and implicitly. Specifically, we select highly confident object proposals under the guidance of class-specific saliency maps. The location information, together with semantic and saliency information, of the select proposals are then used to explicitly supervise the network by imposing two additional losses. Meanwhile, a saliency prediction sub-network is built in the architecture. The prediction results are used to implicitly guide the localization procedure. The entire network is trained end-to-end. Experiments on PASCAL VOC demonstrate that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-arts.",

        "abstract": "How to learn a transferable feature representation from limited examples is a key challenge for few-shot classification. Self-supervision as an auxiliary task to the main supervised few-shot task is considered to be a conceivable way to solve the problem since self-supervision can provide additional structural information easily ignored by the main task. However, learning a good representation by traditional self-supervised methods is usually dependent on large training samples. In few-shot scenarios, due to the lack of sufficient samples, these self-supervised methods might learn a biased representation, which more likely leads to the wrong guidance for the main tasks and finally causes the performance degradation. In this paper, we propose conditional self-supervised learning (CSS) to use auxiliary information to guide the representation learning of self-supervised tasks. Specifically, CSS leverages supervised information as prior knowledge to shape and improve the learning feature manifold of self-supervision without auxiliary unlabeled data, so as to reduce representation bias and mine more effective semantic information. Moreover, CSS exploits more meaningful information through supervised and the improved self-supervised learning respectively and integrates the information into a unified distribution, which can further enrich and broaden the original representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method without any fine-tuning can achieve a significant accuracy improvement on the few-shot classification scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.",

        "abstract": "Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of feedback. In sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity, but it is not known if this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVA), while mice learned multiple tasks as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioral learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was concentrated in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction which we validated with behavioral experiments.",

        "abstract": "AbstractRemote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDynamometer card is one of the vital surveillances for Sucker Rod Pump (SRP) performance monitoring in Duri field. Even though the field produces a massive number of cards, they come with no label or interpretation about the pump conditions based on the card shape. Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists of a pretext task that trains feature extractors by using unlabeled data as opposed to supervised learning, that requires a lot of effort in labeling data which is time consuming and costly. This paper evaluates the performance of a feature extractor, Alexnet, that is trained by using several pretext task techniques. This study used around 660,000 unlabeled cards while a small amount of labeled data was used for evaluation purposes using linear evaluation protocol. The result showed that the trained Alexnet using Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) with jigsaw has better performance by 6% compared to the pre-trained ImageNet model. Further fine-tuning process by using labeled data could achieve 93% accuracy. The model was also tested using fresh data and the result was compared to the expert's interpretation. This approach can potentially add more types of rod pump problems to detect in the Duri field with considerable precision. In addition, the new approach could improve the current method of detecting more SRP with valve leaking problems.",

        "abstract": "Retina disorders are among the common types of eye disease that occur due to several reasons such as aging, diabetes and premature born. Besides, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging method that serves as a vehicle for capturing volumetric scans of the human eye retina for diagnoses purposes. This research compared two pretraining approaches including Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Transfer Learning (TL) to train ResNet34 neural architecture aiming at building computer aided diagnoses tool for retina disorders recognition. In addition, the research methodology employs convolutional auto-encoder model as a generative SSL pretraining method. The research efforts are implemented on a dataset that contains 109,309 retina OCT images with three medical conditions including Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), DRUSEN as well as NORMAL condition. The research outcomes showed better performance in terms of overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, namely, 95.2%, 95.2% and 98.4% respectively for SSL ResNet34 in comparison to scores of 90.7%, 90.7% and 96.9% respectively for TL ResNet34. In addition, SSL pretraining approach showed significant reduction in the number of epochs required for training in comparison to both TL pretraining as well as the previous research performed on the same dataset with comparable performance.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning has become an increasingly ubiquitous technology, as big data continues to inform and influence everyday life and decision-making. Currently in healthcare, as well as in most other industries, the two most prevalent machine learning paradigms are supervised learning and transfer learning. Both practices rely on large-scale, manually annotated datasets to train increasingly complex models. However, the requirement of data to be manually labeled leaves an excess of unused, unlabeled data available in both public and private data repositories. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a growing area of machine learning that has the ability to take advantage of unlabeled data. Contrary to other machine learning paradigms, SSL algorithms create artificial supervisory signals from unlabeled data and pretrain algorithms on these signals. The aim of this review is two-fold: firstly, we provide a formal definition of SSL, divide SSL algorithms into their four unique subsets, and review the state-of-the-art published in each of those subsets between the years of 2014-2020. Second, this work surveys recent SSL algorithms published in healthcare, in order to provide medical experts with a clearer picture of how they can integrate SSL into their research, with the objective of leveraging unlabeled data.",

More precisely, we do an empirical study that analyzes the influence of three types of linguistic features (n-grams, word embeddings, and polarity lexicons) and their combinations when they are used to feed different supervised machine learning classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experiments we have carried out show that SVM clearly outperforms NB and DT in all datasets by taking into account all features individually as well as their combinations.",

Unlike previous work only leveraging synthetic data for model\ntraining, this paper first presents a new real-world EgoCentric Human Action\n(ECHA) dataset.

        "abstract": "AbstractI use a novel supervised ensemble machine learning approach to verify sex estimation of archaeological skeletons from central Italian bioarchaeological contexts with large amounts of missing data present. Eighteen cranial interlandmark distances and five maxillary metric distances were recorded from n = 240 estimated males and n = 180 estimated females from four locations at Alfedena (600-400 BCE) and two locations at Campovalano (750-200 BCE and 9-11th Century CE). A generalized low rank model (GLRM) was used to impute missing data and 20-fold external stratified cross-validation was used to fit an ensemble of eight machine learning algorithms to six different subsets of the data: 1) the face, 2) vault, 3) cranial base, 4) combined face/vault/base, 5) dentition, and 6) combined cranianiodental. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive performance of six constituent algorithms, the discrete algorithmic winner(s), and the SuperLearner weighted ensemble’s classification of males and females from these six bony regions. This approach is useful for predicting male/female sex from central Italy. AUC for the combined craniodental data was the highest (0.9722), followed by the combined cranial data (0.9644), the face (0.9426), vault (0.9116), base (0.9060), and dentition (0.7421). Cross-validated ensemble machine learning of cranial and dental data shows strong potential for estimating sex in the bioarchaeological record and can contribute additional perspectives to help refine our understanding of human sex estimation. Additionally, GLRMs have the potential to handle missing data in ways previously unexplored in the discipline. The main limitation is that the biological sexes of the individuals estimated in this study are not certain, but were estimated macroscopically using common bioarchaeological methods. However, these methods show great promise for estimation of sex in bioarchaeological and forensic contexts and should be investigated on known-sex reference samples for confirmation.",

        "abstract": "Noise is ever present in seismic data and arises from numerous sources and is continually evolving, both spatially and temporally. The use of supervised deep learning procedures for denoising of seismic datasets often results in poor performance: this is due to the lack of noise-free field data to act as training targets and the large difference in characteristics between synthetic and field datasets. Self-supervised, blind-spot networks typically overcome these limitation by training directly on the raw, noisy data. However, such networks often rely on a random noise assumption, and their denoising capabilities quickly decrease in the presence of even minimally-correlated noise. Extending from blind-spots to blind-masks has been shown to efficiently suppress coherent noise along a specific direction, but it cannot adapt to the ever-changing properties of noise. To preempt the network’s ability to predict the signal and reduce its opportunity to learn the noise properties, we propose an initial, supervised training of the network on a frugally-generated synthetic dataset prior to fine-tuning in a self-supervised manner on the field dataset of interest. Considering the change in peak signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the volume of noise reduced and signal leakage observed, using a semi-synthetic example we illustrate the clear benefit in initialising the self-supervised network with the weights from a supervised base-training. This is further supported by a test on a field dataset where the fine-tuned network strikes the best balance between signal preservation and noise reduction. Finally, the use of the unrealistic, frugally-generated synthetic dataset for the supervised base-training includes a number of benefits: minimal prior geological knowledge is required, substantially reduced computational cost for the dataset generation, and a reduced requirement of re-training the network should recording conditions change, to name a few. Such benefits result in a robust denoising procedure suited for long term, passive seismic monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nObjectives/Scope\nIn oil and natural gas exploration, Machine Learning (ML) has gained noteworthy prominence for its ability to decode complex subsurface geology. ML commonly applies advanced statistical algorithms to build robust predictive regression and classification models. On-land Bengal Basin tasted exploratory success recently but displays great ordeal of stratigraphic heterogeneity. This paper discusses application of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and self-organizing map (SOM) ML algorithms with supervisions towards comprehensive modeling of the complex Miocene facies from Bengal on-land area for the maiden time, difficult otherwise by subjective conventional approach.\n\n\nMethods, Procedures, Process\nAdvanced geochemical logs (such as Elemental Capture Spectroscopy, ECS) and core data usually are very useful to quantify the facies downhole. However their availability also demands increased operation time and cost. Whenever available such data can be treated seamlessly with ML to test and build quantitative facies classification model from limited resources to over a region. Facies classification by ML not only makes the most of the available data but also eliminates the undesired subjectivity in addressing the subsurface heterogeneity with higher confidence. Gamma Ray, Neutron-Density, Resistivity, Sonic derived P-wave & S-wave velocities and suitably engineered log derivatives are mathematically modeled from the study area to classify facies using SVM, RF and SOM ML algorithms with ECS and core data calibration.\n\n\nResults, Observations, Conclusions\nMiocene sediments of the study area shows presence of six distinct facies viz. Claystone, Silty Claystone, Clayey Sand, Sandy Clay, Sand and Clean Sand. Facies data are trained by ML algorithms with multifold cross validation and returns credible accuracy for SVM, RF and SOM. The statistics driven facies model has been extrapolated for area where ECS or core data are not available but common logs are and yields geologically acceptable outputs. During exploration and field development stages such ML driven quantitative facies model improves the understanding of the subsurface from reservoir and non-reservoir point of view. ML Facies modeling captures the transition from shelf to fluvial depositional environment in the study area. Association frequency of different facies helps to visualize the changes from low/transitional to higher energy regime on a fine scale within Miocene.\n\n\nNovel/Additive Information\nThis paper discusses appropriate workflow, SVM kernel selection and hyper-parameter optimizations for SVM, RF and SOM that dictate the quality of facies model for Bengal basin. Heterogeneous stratigraphic play of Bengal on-land area demands accurate and quantitative subsurface lithological understanding for deploying fine exploration and development strategies, which can be addressed by this study. Nonetheless RF/SVM appear to be better facies classifier than SOM for Miocene sediments of Bengal from overall classification accuracy especially for less populous facies and calculation time.\n",

        "abstract": "Automatic ship detection provides an essential function towards maritime domain awareness for security or economic monitoring purposes. This work presents an approach for training a deep learning ship detector in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images with few labeled examples. We design a network architecture for detecting ships with a backbone that can be pre-trained separately. By using self supervised learning, an emerging unsupervised training procedure, we learn good features on Sentinel-2 images, without requiring labeling, to initialize our network’s backbone. The full network is then fine-tuned to learn to detect ships in challenging settings. We evaluated this approach versus pre-training on ImageNet and versus a classical image processing pipeline. We examined the impact of variations in the self-supervised learning step and we show that in the few-shot learning setting self-supervised pre-training achieves better results than ImageNet pre-training. When enough training data are available, our self-supervised approach is as good as ImageNet pre-training. We conclude that a better design of the self-supervised task and bigger non-annotated dataset sizes can lead to surpassing ImageNet pre-training performance without any annotation costs.",

Leveraging the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset's high-resolution, global, and bias-corrected data, we compare various machine learning regression algorithms. Focusing on the EC Earth3 model, our approach involves an in-depth analysis of five weather variables closely tied to daily rainfall. We employed a diverse set of algorithms, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbor regression (KNN), random forest regression, decision tree regression, AdaBoost, extra tree regression, extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBoost), support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting decision tree regression (GBDT), and multi-layer perceptron. Performance evaluation highlights the superior predictive capabilities of Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and KNN, achieving an impressive RMSE score of 0.04 and an accuracy score of 0.99. In contrast, XGBoost exhibits lower performance metrics, with an RMSE score of 5.1 and an accuracy score of 0.49, indicating poor rainfall prediction. This study contributes in advancing rainfall prediction models, hence emphasizing the improvement of methodological choices in harnessing machine learning for climate research.",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection has recently received much attention, since it only requires image-level labels instead of the bounding-box labels consumed in strongly supervised learning. Nevertheless, the save in labeling expense is usually at the cost of model accuracy.In this paper, we propose a simple but effective weakly supervised collaborative learning framework to resolve this problem, which trains a weakly supervised learner and a strongly supervised learner jointly by enforcing partial feature sharing and prediction consistency. For object detection, taking WSDDN-like architecture as weakly supervised detector sub-network and Faster-RCNN-like architecture as strongly supervised detector sub-network, we propose an end-to-end Weakly Supervised Collaborative Detection Network. As there is no strong supervision available to train the Faster-RCNN-like sub-network, a new prediction consistency loss is defined to enforce consistency of predictions between the two sub-networks as well as within the Faster-RCNN-like sub-networks. At the same time, the two detectors are designed to partially share features to further guarantee the model consistency at perceptual level. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

This task is particularly challenging in scenarios where data is scarce. Visual transformers (ViT) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for image classification, due to their ability to learn highly expressive representations of visual data using self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we explore Semi-ViT, a ViT model fine tuned using semi-supervised learning techniques, suitable for situations  where we have lack of annotated data. This is particularly common in e-commerce, where images are readily available but labels are noisy, nonexistent, or expensive to obtain. Our results demonstrate that Semi-ViT outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and ViTs, even when fine-tuned with limited annotated data. These findings indicate that Semi-ViTs hold significant promise for applications that require precise and fine-grained classification of visual data.",

        "abstract": "Deep Learning has been a remarkable state-of-the-art method in any classification challenge, particularly in face recognition applications. In this paper, Feature Extraction in face recognition using Deep CNNs handpicked pre-trained CNN architectures such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG19 were experimentally explored. Initially, these architectures extracted important features from eight (8) classes of face photos with large age differences of ten (10) years from the present age of an individual. The features were processed with the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to enhance its performance. The evaluation of each model was based on average scores ofaccuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The results concluded an accuracy of 84.60%, a weighted precision of 85%, a weighted recall of 84.60%, and a weighted f1-score of 84.60% obtained by ResNet50.Further, ResNet50 has the highest obtained 98% generated ROC-AUC score. With the results presented, ResNet50 isrecommended for application development related to face recognition with the consideration of large age gaps of 10 years.",

        "abstract": "Blood vessel segmentation methods based on deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory results. However, these methods are usually supervised learning methods, which require large numbers of retinal images with high quality pixel-level ground-truth labels. In practice, the task of labeling these retinal images is very costly, financially and in human effort. To deal with these problems, we propose a semi-supervised learning method which can be used in blood vessel segmentation with limited labeled data. In this method, we use the improved U-Net deep learning network to segment the blood vessel tree. On this basis, we implement the U-Net network-based training dataset updating strategy. A large number of experiments are presented to analyze the segmentation performance of the proposed semi-supervised learning method. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to avoid the problems of insufficient hand-labels, and achieve satisfactory performance.",

        "abstract": "When specifying a predictive model for classification, variable selection (or subset selection) is one of the most important steps for researchers to consider. Reducing the necessary number of variables in a prediction model is vital for many reasons, including reducing the burden of data collection and increasing model efficiency and generalizability. The pool of variable selection methods from which to choose is large, and researchers often struggle to identify which method they should use given the specific features of their data set. Yet, there is a scarcity of literature available to guide researchers in their choice; the literature centers on comparing different implementations of a given method rather than comparing different methodologies under varying data features. Through the implementation of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation and the application to one empirical dataset we evaluated the prediction error rates, area under the receiver operating curve, number of variables selected, computation times, and true positive rates of five different variable selection methods using R under varying parameterizations (i.e., default vs. grid tuning): the genetic algorithm (ga), LASSO (glmnet), Elastic Net (glmnet), Support Vector Machines (svmfs), and random forest (Boruta). Performance measures did not converge upon a single best method; as such, researchers should guide their method selection based on what measure of performance they deem most important. Results did show that the SVM approach performed worst and researchers are advised to use other methods. LASSO and Elastic Net performed well in most conditions, but researchers may face non-convergence problems if these methods are chosen. Random forest performed well across simulation conditions. Based on our study, the genetic algorithm is the most widely applicable method, exhibiting minimum error rates in hold-out samples when compared to other variable selection methods.",

        "abstract": "With the vast usage of network services, Security became an important issue for all network types. Various techniques emerged to grant network security; among them is Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Many extant NIDSs actively work against various intrusions, but there are still a number of performance issues including high false alarm rates, and numerous undetected attacks. To keep up with these attacks, some of the academic researchers turned towards machine learning (ML) techniques to create software that automatically predict intrusive and abnormal traffic, another approach is to utilize ML algorithms in enhancing Traditional NIDSs which is a more feasible solution since they are widely spread. To upgrade the detection rates of current NIDSs, thorough analyses are essential to identify where ML predictors outperform them. The first step is to provide assessment of most used NIDS worldwide, Snort, and comparing its performance with ML classifiers. This paper provides an empirical study to evaluate performance of Snort and four supervised ML classifiers, KNN, Decision Tree, Bayesian net and Naïve Bays against network attacks, probing, Brute force and DoS. By measuring Snort metric, True Alarm Rate, F-measure, Precision and Accuracy and compares them with the same metrics conducted from applying ML algorithms using Weka tool. ML classifiers show an elevated performance with over 99% correctly classified instances for most algorithms, While Snort intrusion detection system shows a degraded classification of about 25% correctly classified instances, hence identifying Snort weaknesses towards certain attack types and giving leads on how to overcome those weaknesses. \nes.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from time resolved gene expression measurements is a key challenge in systems biology with applications in health and disease. While the most popular network inference methods are based on unsupervised learning approaches, supervised learning methods have proven their potential for superior reconstruction performance. However, obtaining the appropriate volume of informative training data constitutes a key limitation for the success of such methods.Here, we introduce a supervised learning approach to detect gene-gene regulation based on exclusively synthetic training data, termed surrogate learning, and show its performance for synthetic and experimental time-series. We systematically investigate different simulation configurations of biologically representative time-series of transcripts and augmentation of the data with a measurement model. We compare the resulting synthetic datasets to experimental data, and evaluate classifiers trained on them for detection of gene-gene regulation from experimental time-series. For classifiers, we consider hybrid convolutional recurrent neural networks, random forests and logistic regression, and evaluate the reconstruction performance of different simulation settings, data pre-processing and classifiers.When training and test time-courses are generated from the same distribution, we find that the largest tested neural network architecture achieves the best performance of 0.448 ± 0.047 (mean ± std) in maximally achievable F1 score over all datasets outperforming random forests by 32.4 % ± 14 % (mean ± std). Reconstruction performance is sensitive to discrepancies between synthetic training and test data, highlighting the importance of matching training and test data domains. For an experimental gene expression dataset from E.coli, we find that training data generated with measurement model, multi-gene perturbations, but without data standardization is best suited for training classifiers for network reconstruction from the experimental test data. We further demonstrate superiority to multiple unsupervised, state-of-the-art methods for networks comprising 20 genes of the experimental data from E.coli (average AUPR best supervised = 0.22 vs best unsupervised = 0.07).We expect the proposed surrogate learning approach to be broadly applicable. It alleviates the requirement for large, difficult to attain volumes of experimental training data and instead relies on easily accessible synthetic data. Successful application for new experimental conditions and other data types is only limited by the automatable and scalable process of designing simulations which generate suitable synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe deep learning-powered computational pathology has led to sig-nificant improvements in the speed and precise of tumor diagnosis,, while also exhibiting substantial potential to infer genetic mutations and gene expression levels. However,current studies remain limited in predicting molecular subtypes and recurrence risk in breast cancer. In this paper, we proposed a weakly supervised contrastive learning framework to address this challenge. Our framework first performed contrastive learning pretraining on large-scale unlabeled patches tiled from whole slide images (WSIs) to extract patch-level features. The gated attention mechanism was leveraged to aggregate patch-level features to produce slide feature that was then applied to various downstream tasks. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on four independent cohorts of breast cancer. For gene expression prediction task, rather than one model per gene, we adopted multitask learning to infer the expression levels of 21 recurrence-related genes, and achieved remarkable performance and generalizability that were validated on an external cohort. Particularly, the predictive power to infer molecular subtypes and recurrence events was strongly validated by cross-cohort experiments. In addition, the learned patch-level attention scores enabled us to generate heatmaps that were highly consistent with pathologist annotations and spatial transcriptomic data. These findings demonstrated that our model effectively established the high-order genotype-phenotype associations, thereby enhances the potential of digital pathology in clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Recovering height information from a single aerial image is a key problem in the fields of computer vision and remote sensing. At present, supervised learning methods have achieved impressive results, but, due to domain bias, the trained model cannot be directly applied to a new scene. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework, StyHighNet, for accurately estimating the height of a single aerial image in a new city that requires only a small number of labeled data. The core is to transfer multi-source images to a unified style, making the unlabeled data provide the appearance distribution as additional supervision signals. The framework mainly contains three sub-networks: (1) the style transferring sub-network maps multi-source images into unified style distribution maps (USDMs); (2) the height regression sub-network, with the function of predicting the height maps from USDMs; and (3) the style discrimination sub-network, used to distinguish the sources of USDMs. Among them, the style transferring sub-network shoulders dual responsibilities: On the one hand, it needs to compute USDMs with obvious characteristics, so that the height regression sub-network can accurately estimate the height maps. On the other hand, it is necessary that the USDMs have consistent distribution to confuse the style discrimination sub-network, so as to achieve the goal of domain adaptation. Unlike previous methods, our style distribution function is learned unsupervised, thus it is of greater flexibility and better accuracy. Furthermore, when the style discrimination sub-network is shielded, this framework can also be used for supervised learning. We performed qualitatively and quantitative evaluations on two sets of public data, Vaihingen and Potsdam. Experiments show that the framework achieved superior performance in both supervised and semi-supervised learning modes.",

This removal results in a lack of ongoing training data and impairs the ability to improve recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel semi-supervised learning approach for NILM systems. The approach is based on a previously proposed temporal convolutional network-conditional random field (TCN-CRF) model. It uses optimal interval filtering and unanimous voting to control the quality of pseudo-labels. The approach identifies high-precision segments in the sequence-to-sequence algorithm as semi-supervised learning targets and generates pseudo-labels, allowing for continuous self-supervised learning and sustained improvement in recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can effectively combine unlabeled data to improve model accuracy, and achieve up to 14% highest improvement in algorithm accuracy over fully self-supervised methods in small sample training.</p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe rapid growth and scaling of electronics are causing more severe thermal management challenges. For example, the high-performance computing processors are driving the data center power density to unprecedented levels, approaching the limit of conventional air cooling. In electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs, the power conversion electronics are integrated into a compact space, leading to ultra-high heat fluxes to dissipate. Among the available thermal management mechanisms, two-phase cooling that involves the phase-change process of the working fluid can maintain electronic devices at safe operating temperatures by taking advantage of the high latent heat of the fluid. Particularly, pool boiling plays a critical role in the two-phase immersion cooling of servers and other IT hardware, integrated cooling for three-dimensional electronic packaging, cooling of the core, and used fuel in nuclear reactors. Two-phase coolers are limited by instabilities such as the critical heat flux (CHF). At the critical heat flux, the temperature increases. It is important to be able to identify the CHF in order to prevent overheating. We aim to develop and compare boiling image classification models to distinguish between 2 boiling regimes. We will leverage principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to investigate the key differences between bubbles during nucleate boiling (pre-CHF) and transition boiling (post-CHF). We will also compare the results of the unsupervised learning model against popular supervised learning models that have been used for boiling regime classification in existing studies, such as convolutional neural networks, multiplayer perceptrons, and transformers. We successfully created 4 supervised and 1 unsupervised learning models to distinguish between the two types of boiling images.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework to enable automatic re-training of the supervisory powertrain control strategy for hybrid electric vehicles using supervised machine learning. The aim of re-training is to customize the control strategy to a user-specific driving behavior without human intervention. The framework is designed to update the control strategy at the end of a driving task. A combination of dynamic programming and supervised machine learning is used to train the control strategy. The trained control strategy denoted as SML is compared to an online-implementable strategy based on the combination of the optimal operation line and Pontryagin’s minimum principle denoted as OOL-PMP, on the basis of fuel consumption. SML consistently performed better than OOL-PMP, evaluated over five standard drive cycles. The EUDC performance was almost identical while on FTP75 the OOL-PMP consumed 14.7% more fuel than SML. Moreover, the deviation from the global benchmark obtained from dynamic programming was between 1.8% and 5.4% for SML and between 5.8% and 16.8% for OOL-PMP. Furthermore, a test-case was conducted to emulate a real-world driving scenario wherein a trained controller is exposed to a new drive cycle. It is found that the performance on the new drive cycle deviates significantly from the optimal policy; however, this performance gap is bridged with a single re-training episode for the respective test-case.",

Although deep learning-based methods have been effectively applied for SEI, their performance declines dramatically with the smaller number of labeled training samples and in the presence of significant noise. To address this issue, we propose an improved Bootstrap Your Own Late (BYOL) self-supervised learning scheme to fully exploit the unlabeled samples, which comprises the pretext task adopting contrastive learning conception and the downstream task. We designed three optimized data augmentation methods for communication signals in the former task to serve the contrastive concept. We built two neural networks, online and target networks, which interact and learn from each other. The proposed scheme demonstrates the generality of handling the small and sufficient sample cases across a wide range from 10 to 400, being labeled in each group. The experiment also shows promising accuracy and robustness where the recognition results increase at 3-8% from 3 to 7 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our scheme can accurately identify the individual emitter in a complicated electromagnetic environment.",

Increasing renewable energy utilization, reliability and efficiency of system operation and flexibility of energy sharing amongst several microgrids (MGs) are some specific privileges of NMG. In this paper, residential MGs, commercial MGs, and industrial MGs are considered as a community of NMG. The loads’ profiles are split into multiple sections to evaluate the maximum load demand (MLD). Based on the optimal operation of each MG, the operating reserve (OR) of the MGs is calculated for each section. Then, the self-organizing map as a supervised and a k-means algorithm as an unsupervised learning clustering method is utilized to cluster the MGs and effective energy-sharing. The clustering is based on the maximum load demand of MGs and the operating reserve of dispatchable energy sources, and the goal is to provide a more efficient system with high reliability. Eventually, the performance of this energy management and its benefits to the whole system is surveyed effectively. The proposed energy management system offers a more reliable system due to the possibility of reserved energy for MGs in case of power outage variation or shortage of power.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been considerable research on deepfake detection. However, most existing methods face challenges in adapting to the advancements in new generative models within unknown domains. In addition, the emergence of new generative models capable of producing and editing high-quality images, such as Diffusion, Consistency, and LCM, poses a challenge for traditional deepfake training models. These advancements highlight the need for adapting and evolving existing deepfake detection techniques to effectively counter the threats posed by sophisticated image manipulation technologies. In this paper, our objective is to detect deepfake videos in unknown domains using unlabeled data. Specifically, our proposed approach employs Meta Pseudo Labels (MPL) with Supervised Contrastive Learning, so-called SupCon-MPL, allowing the model to be trained on unlabeled images. MPL involves the simultaneous training of both a Teacher model and a Student model, where the Teacher model generates Pseudo Labels utilized to train the Student model. This method aims to enhance the adaptability and robustness of deepfake detection systems against emerging unknown domains. Supervised Contrastive Learning utilizes labels to compare samples within similar classes more intensively, while encouraging greater distinction from samples in dissimilar classes. This facilitates the learning of features in a diverse set of deepfake images by the model, consequently contributing to the performance of deepfake detection in unknown domains. When utilizing the ResNet50 model as the backbone, SupCon-MPL exhibited an improvement of 1.58% in accuracy compared to traditional MPL in known domain detection. Moreover, in the same generation of unknown domain detection, there was a 1.32% accuracy enhancement, while in the detection of post-generation unknown domains, there was an 8.74% increase in accuracy.",

        "abstract": "With recent increases in the size of datasets currently available in the psychological sciences, the need for efficient and effective variable selection techniques has increased. A plethora of techniques exist, yet only a few are used within the psychological sciences (e.g., stepwise regression, which is most common, LASSO, and Elastic Net). The purpose of this tutorial is to increase awareness of the various variable selection methods available in the popular statistical software R, and guide researchers through how each method can be used to select variables in the context of classification using a recent survey-based assessment of misophonia. Specifically, readers will learn about how to implement and interpret results from the LASSO, Elastic Net, a penalized SVM classifier, an implementation of random forest, and the genetic algorithm. The associated code and data implemented in this tutorial are available on OSF to allow for a more interactive experience. This paper is written with the assumption that individuals have at least a basic understanding of R.",

        "abstract": "The 2S-DT (Self-Supervised Decomposition for Transfer Learning) model, created for crop categorization using remotely sensed data, is a unique method introduced in this paper. It deals with the difficulty of incorrectly identifying crops with comparable phenology patterns, a problem that frequently arises in agricultural remote sensing. Two datasets from Nanajangudu taluk in the Mysore district, which has a widely varied irrigated agriculture system, are used to assess the model. Using self-supervised learning, the 2S-DT model addresses the misclassification issue that frequently occurs when working with unlabeled classes, especially in high-resolution images. It uses class decomposition (CD) layer and a downstream learning approach. Using the model’s learning and the particulars of each geographical context, this layer improves the information’s arrangement. Our model architecture’s foundation is ResNet, a well-known deep learning framework. Each residual block in our ResNet architecture is made up of two 3x3 convolutional layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, which improve the model’s capacity for learning. We utilized a 7x7 convolutional layer with 64 filters and a stride of 2 for Conv1 in ResNet18, resulting in an output size of 112x112x64. Conv2, which consists of Res2a and Res2b, generated an output with the dimensions 48x48x64. Conv3, which included Res3a and Res3b, produced an output with the dimensions 28x28x128. These architectural selections were made with our experimental needs in mind. The 2S-DT model’s newly added features make it easier to identify classes and update weights, improving the stability of the features’ spatial and spectral data. Extensive tests performed on two datasets show the model’s viability. Overall accuracy has improved significantly, with the 2S-DT model surpassing comparable models like TVSM, 3DCAE, and GAN Model by obtaining 95.65% accuracy for dataset 1 and 88.91% accuracy for dataset 2.",

Existing analysis methods are based on frequency domain which can lead to inaccurate assessments of reinforced concrete bridge decks since they do not consider features of the IE signals in the time domain. The authors propose a new method for IE classification by combining features in the time and the frequency domains. The features used in this study included normalized peak values, energy, power, time of peaks, and signal lengths that were extracted from IE signals after they are preprocessed. We used a dataset containing IE data collected from four in-service bridges, annotated using chain dragging. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was constructed using combined features to classify IE signals. A 1DCNN with unfiltered IE signals and a two-dimensional CNN using wavelet scalograms (2D representations of unfiltered IE signals) were also used to classify IE signals. The SVM model performed significantly better than the other models, with an accuracy rate, true positive rate, and true negative rate of 97%, 92%, and 98%, respectively. The SVM model also generated more accurate defect maps for all investigated bridges. IE data from the Federal Highway Administration’s InfoBridge website were used to investigate the efficacy of the developed models. The investigation yielded promising results for the proposed SVM model when used for a new set of IE data.",

        "abstract": "Multi-class classification is a fascinating field to study. However, evaluating the classification performance of classifiers is difficult. Class indices such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, Kappa and area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC), can be used to evaluate classification performance. These indices describe the classification results achieved on each modelled class. Several measures have been introduced in the literature to deal with this assessment, the most commonly used being accuracy. In general these metrics were proposed to address binary classification tasks, whereas multiclass classification is the more difficult and currently active research area in machine learning (ML). In this paper, we intended to compare classification performance of nine supervised machine learning algorithms based on three learner types: statistical learner, rule-based learner and neural-base learner by considering accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure and ROC area achieved on four different datasets from UCI machine repository. Among these, Random forest has been the best performance in both 10 fold cross validation and percentage split with overall average accuracy of predictive power of 92.20% and 91.76% respectively, with less variability, whereas Naïve Bayes has the worst also in both 10 fold cross validation and percentage split by average correct classification performance of 79.18% and 76.92% respectively, and also with higher variability next to Decision Table.",

Traditional methods, however, often suffer from limitations such as sluggish computational speed or heavy reliance on biased training datasets. These challenges are magnified when aiming for accurate ΔΔG prediction across the vast universe of protein sequences. In this study, we present Pythia, a self-supervised graph neural network tailored for zero-shot ΔΔG predictions. In comparative benchmarks with other self-supervised pre-training models and force field-based methods, Pythia outshines its contenders with superior correlations while operating with the fewest parameters, and exhibits a remarkable acceleration in computational speed, up to 105-fold. The efficacy of Pythia is corroborated through its application in predicting thermostable mutations of limonene epoxide hydrolase (LEH) with significant higher experimental success rates. This efficiency propels the exploration of 26 million high-quality protein structures. Such a grand-scale application signifies a leap forward in our capacity to traverse the protein sequence space and potentially enrich our insights into the intricacies of protein genotype-phenotype relationships.

However very recent studies pre-trained their models on ImageNet and fine-tuned on specific downstream ReID dataset, which leads to restricted generalization capability of person centered tasks. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model with Oriented Token Prior guided Knowledge Distillation. The proposed approach adopts the teacher-student network and attempts to not only restore the masked or low-quality samples, but also to align the semantics of the patches in feature domain. Within this framework, our model is pre-trained on a person-specific dataset LUPerson, which indicates a larger data scale with person-centered samples. Extensive experiments carried out on ReID datasets Market1501, MSMT17 and Occluded-Duke shows that the proposed method yield the state-of-the-art performance among the supervised and SSL ReID methods. Moreover, the proposed method could obtain the remarkable performance of partial supervised and unsupervised learning, which further indicates the strong generalizability and the robustness of our method.

        "abstract": "The measurement of reverberation time is an essential procedure for the characterization of the acoustic performance of rooms. The values returned by these measurements allow us to predict how the sound will be transformed by the walls and furnishings of the rooms. The measurement of the reverberation time is not an easy procedure to carry out and requires the use of a space in an exclusive way. In fact, it is necessary to use instruments that reproduce a sound source and instruments for recording the response of the space. In this work, an automatic procedure for estimating the reverberation time based on the use of artificial neural networks was developed. Previously selected sounds were played, and joint sound recordings were made. The recorded sounds were processed with the extraction of characteristics, then they were labeled by associating to each sound the value of the reverberation time in octave bands of that specific room. The obtained dataset was used as input for the training of an algorithm based on artificial neural networks. The results returned by the predictive model suggest using this methodology to estimate the reverberation time of any closed space, using simple audio recordings without having to perform standard measurements or calculate the integration explicitly.",

        "abstract": "Risk-averse areas such as the medical, aerospace and energy sectors have been somewhat slow towards accepting and applying Additive Manufacturing (AM) in many of their value chains. This is partly because there are still signicant uncertainties concerning the quality of AM builds. This paper introduces a machine learning algorithm for the automatic detection of faults in AM products. The approach is semi-supervised in that, during training, it is able to use data from both builds where the resulting components were certied and builds where the quality of the resulting components is unknown. This makes the approach cost ecient, particularly in scenarios where part certication is costly and time consuming. The study specically analyses Selective Laser Melting (SLM) builds. Key features are extracted from large sets of photodiode data, obtained during the building of 49 tensile test bars. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) tests were then used to categorise each bar as `faulty' or `acceptable'. A fully supervised approach identied faulty specimens with a 77% success rate while the semi-supervised approach was able to consistently achieve similar results, despite being trained on a fraction of the available certication data. The results show that semi-supervised learning is a promising approach for the automatic certication of AM builds that can be implemented at a fraction of the cost currently required.",

However, how to effectively combine multiple SSL models is still challenging and has been rarely explored. Therefore, we propose multi-task joint strategies of self-supervised representation learning on biomedical networks for drug discovery, named MSSL2drug. We design six basic SSL tasks inspired by various modality features including structures, semantics, and attributes in heterogeneous biomedical networks.\nIn addition, fifteen combinations of multiple tasks are evaluated by a graph attention-based adversarial multi-task learning framework in two drug discovery scenarios. The results suggest two important findings. (1) Combinations of multimodal tasks achieve the best performance compared to other multi-task joint strategies. (2) The joint training of local and global SSL tasks yields higher performance than random task combinations. Therefore, we conjecture that the multimodal and local-global combination strategies can be treated as a guideline of multi-task SSL for drug discovery.",

Methods: The study examines the alum sample data obtained from a survey from Tecnologico de Monterrey, a multicampus Mexican private university, and analyses it within the cross-industry standard process for data mining. Survey results include 17,898 and 12,275 observations before and after cleaning and pre-processing, respectively. The dataset includes values for income and a large set of independent variables, including demographic and occupational attributes of the former students and academic attributes from the institution’s history. We conduct an in-depth analysis to determine whether the accuracy of traditional algorithms in econometric research to predict income can be improved with a data science approach. Furthermore, we present insights on patterns obtained using explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Results: Results show that the gradient boosting model outperformed the parametric models, linear and logistic regression, in predicting alum’s current income with statistically significant results (p < 0.05) in three tasks: ordinary least-squares regression, multi-class classification and binary classification. Moreover, the linear and logistic regression models were found to be the most accurate methods for predicting the alum’s first income. The non-parametric models showed no significant improvements. Conclusion: We identified that age, gender, working hours per week, first income after graduation and variables related to the alum’s job position and firm contributed to explaining their income. Findings indicated a gender wage gap, suggesting that further work is needed to enable equality.",

In this paper, Feature Extraction in face recognition using Deep CNNs handpicked pre-trained CNN architectures such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG19 were experimentally explored. Initially, these architectures extracted important features from eight (8) classes of face photos with large age differences of ten (10) years from the present age of an individual. The features were processed with the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to enhance its performance. The evaluation of each model was based on average scores ofaccuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The results concluded an accuracy of 84.60%, a weighted precision of 85%, a weighted recall of 84.60%, and a weighted f1-score of 84.60% obtained by ResNet50.Further, ResNet50 has the highest obtained 98% generated ROC-AUC score. With the results presented, ResNet50 isrecommended for application development related to face recognition with the consideration of large age gaps of 10 years.",

        "abstract": "Blood vessel segmentation methods based on deep neural networks have achieved satisfactory results. However, these methods are usually supervised learning methods, which require large numbers of retinal images with high quality pixel-level ground-truth labels. In practice, the task of labeling these retinal images is very costly, financially and in human effort. To deal with these problems, we propose a semi-supervised learning method which can be used in blood vessel segmentation with limited labeled data. In this method, we use the improved U-Net deep learning network to segment the blood vessel tree. On this basis, we implement the U-Net network-based training dataset updating strategy. A large number of experiments are presented to analyze the segmentation performance of the proposed semi-supervised learning method. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to avoid the problems of insufficient hand-labels, and achieve satisfactory performance.",

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm that combines consistency regularization and pseudo-labels to help identify appliances with a small amount of labeled data and some unlabeled data.\nIn addition, given the different learning difficulties of different appliances among users, for example, the feature learning difficulty of multi-state appliances is often higher than that of single-state appliances. Therefore, we employ that the threshold values of different appliance classes be changed in a flexible way at each time step so that the informative unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels can be passed.\nWe have carried out simulation experiments on public dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better appliance identification results than the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Agriculture is one of the major fields in India that has been overlooked by technical touch. The application of artificial intelligence derivatives such as machine learning and deep learning to agricultural practises aids in crop production and soil health maintenance. The health of an agricultural field is primarily concerned with the preservation of soil nutrients, such as chemical and physical properties, by properly transmitting supplements. When soil health is managed scientifically, it gradually aids in high yield production and the long life of cultivation land. The soil data collected from soil testing centres is used to build the ontology. Ontology is constructed in such a way that it demonstrates the knowledge and relationship between soil and its chemical nutrients. The knowledge base is then used to connect the nutrient and soil type. Machine learning comes with useful and best-in-class algorithms for managing soil health and classifying it into healthy and unhealthy categories. In this study, obvious machine learning algorithms are used to efficiently classify the soil into two classes: healthy and unhealthy. To classify the data, algorithms such as logistic regression, Decision tree, Random tree classifier, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost were used, and their algorithmic efficiency was increased through hyper parameter tuning using various techniques.

        "abstract": "Summary\nA fundamental challenge in semi-supervised learning lies in the observed data’s disproportional size when compared with the size of the data collected with missing outcomes. An implicit understanding is that the dataset with missing outcomes, being significantly larger, ought to improve estimation and inference. However, it is unclear to what extent this is correct. We illustrate one clear benefit: root-$n$ inference of the outcome’s mean is possible while only requiring a consistent estimation of the outcome, possibly at a rate slower than root $n$. This is achieved by a novel $k$-fold, cross-fitted, double robust estimator. We discuss both linear and nonlinear outcomes. Such an estimator is particularly suited for models that naturally do not admit root-$n$ consistency, such as high-dimensional, nonparametric or semiparametric models. We apply our methods to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.",

Existing approaches make multi-label prediction by exploiting the incomplete logical labels directly without considering the relative importance of each label to an instance. In this paper, a novel two-stage strategy named Weakly Supervised Multi-label Learning via Label Enhancement (WSMLLE) is proposed to learn from weakly supervised data via label enhancement. Firstly, the relative importance of each label, i.e., the description degrees are recovered by leveraging the structural information in the feature space and local correlations learned from the label space. Then, a tailored multi-label predictive model is induced by learning from the training instances with the recovered description degrees. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt to unify the complement of the missing labels and the recovery of the description degrees into the same framework. Extensive experiments across a wide range of real-world datasets clearly validate the superiority of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor biopsies or surgical specimens can offer valuable insights into TIME, but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultra-high resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However, studies on revealing TIME from pathology images are still limited.In this paper, we proposed a novel weakly supervised contrastive learning model to deduce tumor immune microenvironment features from whole slide images (WSIs) of H&E stained pathological sections. The high-resolution WSIs are split into tiles, and then contrastive learning is applied to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level, we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive downstream experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that our computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor infiltrating immune cells, particularly the infiltration level of macrophages, as well as the immune subtypes and biomarker gene expression levels. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision, establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology, thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images.",

        "abstract": "A considerable number of approaches based on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have been proposed in Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) so far. These approaches significantly enhance the SSL methods by effectively utilizing large amount of unlabeled data to improve the model’s performance. However, existing methods may fail to utilize the unlabeled data more efficiently, mainly due to the challenges faced in pseudo-label estimation. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the impact of the pseudo-label estimation method on training the SSL model. Furthermore, we emphasize that an effective pseudo-label estimation method should reflect the difference of recognition performance among samples from different categories, and also ensure the maintenance of both high-quantity and high-quality pseudo-labels during each training iteration. Based on above analysis, we propose DYMatch, an innovative SSL method employing a dynamic estimation process. Firstly, a dynamic pseudo-label estimation method based on Gaussian mixture model is proposed to dynamically estimate the confidence threshold on different categories. Secondly, a feature-correlation consistency regularization method is introduced to further enhance the learning on unlabeled data. The experimental results show that DYMatch is a simple and effective SSL method, especially when the labeled data is limited.",

        "abstract": "<p>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems are widely used for energy management, but their accuracy can be limited by the removal of monitoring equipment after the initial training phase. This removal results in a lack of ongoing training data and impairs the ability to improve recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel semi-supervised learning approach for NILM systems. The approach is based on a previously proposed temporal convolutional network-conditional random field (TCN-CRF) model. It uses optimal interval filtering and unanimous voting to control the quality of pseudo-labels. The approach identifies high-precision segments in the sequence-to-sequence algorithm as semi-supervised learning targets and generates pseudo-labels, allowing for continuous self-supervised learning and sustained improvement in recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can effectively combine unlabeled data to improve model accuracy, and achieve up to 14% highest improvement in algorithm accuracy over fully self-supervised methods in small sample training.</p>",

        "abstract": "Machine learning-based indoor localization used to suffer from the collection, construction, and maintenance of labeled training databases for practical implementation. Semi-supervised learning methods have been developed as efficient indoor localization methods to reduce use of labeled training data. To boost the efficiency and the accuracy of indoor localization, this paper proposes a new time-series semi-supervised learning algorithm. The key aspect of the developed method, which distinguishes it from conventional semi-supervised algorithms, is the use of unlabeled data. The learning algorithm finds spatio-temporal relationships in the unlabeled data, and pseudolabels are generated to compensate for the lack of labeled training data. In the next step, another balancing-optimization learning algorithm learns a positioning model. The proposed method is evaluated for estimating the location of a smartphone user by using a Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement. The experimental results show that the developed learning algorithm outperforms some existing semi-supervised algorithms according to the variation of the number of training data and access points. Also, the proposed method is discussed in terms of why it gives better performance, by the analysis of the impact of the learning parameters. Moreover, the extended localization scheme in conjunction with a particle filter is executed to include additional information, such as a floor plan.",

        "abstract": "From a single meter that measures the entire home’s electrical demand, energy disaggregation calculates appliance-by-appliance electricity consumption. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), also known as energy disaggregation, tries to decompose aggregated energy consumption data and estimate each appliance’s contribution. Recently, methodologies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been proposed commonly used in these models, which can be expensive to run on a server or prohibitive when the target device has limited capabilities. AI-based models are typically computationally expensive and require a lot of storage. It is not easy to reduce the computing cost and size of a neural network without sacrificing performance. This study proposed an efficient non-parametric supervised machine learning network (ENSML) architecture with a smaller size, and a quick inference time without sacrificing performance. The proposed architecture can maximise energy disaggregation performance and predict new observations based on past ones. The results showed that employing the ENSML model considerably increased the accuracy of energy prediction in 99 percent of cases.",

Up to now, a large amount of unsupervised dimension reduction methods have been proposed and studied. However, there is no specific review focusing on the supervised dimension reduction problem. Most studies performed classification or regression after unsupervised dimension reduction methods. However, we recognize the following advantages if learning the low-dimensional representation and the classification/regression model simultaneously: high accuracy and effective representation. Considering classification or regression as being the main goal of dimension reduction, the purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the current developments in the field into three main classes: PCA-based, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based, and manifold-based supervised dimension reduction methods, as well as provide elaborated discussions on their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we outline a dozen open problems that can be further explored to advance the development of this topic.",

Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in silico. Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multilayer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three-factor learning rule capable of training multilayer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric, and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike time patterns.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImproving resource utilization is an important goal of high-performance computing systems of supercomputing centers. In order to meet this goal, the job scheduler of high-performance computing systems often use backfilling scheduling to fill short-time jobs into the gaps of jobs at the front of the queue. Backfilling scheduling needs to obtain the running time of the job. In the past, the job running times are usually given by users and often far exceeded the actual running time of the job, which leads to inaccurate backfilling and a waste of computing resources. In particular, when the predicted job running time is lower than the actual time, the damage caused to the utilization of the system’s computing resources becomes more serious. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of the job running time is crucial to the utilization of system resources. The use of machine learning methods can make more accurate predictions of the job running time. Aiming at the parallel application of aerodynamics, we propose a job running time prediction framework SU combining supervised and unsupervised learning, and verifies it on the real historical data of the high-performance computing systems of China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center(CARDC). The experimental results show that SU has a high prediction accuracy(80.46%) and a low underestimation rate(24.85%).",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of breast masses is an essential step in computer aided diagnosis of breast cancer. The scarcity of annotated training data greatly hinders the model’s generalization ability, especially for the deep learning based methods. However, high-quality image-level annotations are time-consuming and cumbersome in medical image analysis scenarios. In addition, a large amount of weak annotations is under-utilized which comprise common anatomy features. To this end, inspired by teacher-student networks, we propose an Anatomy-Aware Weakly-Supervised learning Network (AAWS-Net) for extracting useful information from mammograms with weak annotations for efficient and accurate breast mass segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a weakly-supervised learning strategy in the Teacher to extract anatomy structure from mammograms with weak annotations by reconstructing the original image. Besides, knowledge distillation is used to suggest morphological differences between benign and malignant masses. Moreover, the prior knowledge learned from the Teacher is introduced to the Student in an end-to-end way, which improves the ability of the student network to locate and segment masses. Experiments on CBIS-DDSM have shown that our method yields promising performance compared with state-of-the-art alternative models for breast mass segmentation in terms of segmentation accuracy and IoU.",

For the non-operative diagnosis of breast carcinoma, core needle biopsy has been widely used in recent years for the evaluation of histopathological features, as it can provide a definitive diagnosis between IDC and benign lesion (e.g., fibroadenoma), and it is cost effective. Due to its widespread use, it could potentially benefit from the use of AI-based tools to aid pathologists in their pathological diagnosis workflows. In this paper, we trained invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) whole slide image (WSI) classification models using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning. We evaluated the models on a core needle biopsy (n = 522) test set as well as three surgical test sets (n = 1129) obtaining ROC AUCs in the range of 0.95–0.98. The promising results demonstrate the potential of applying such models as diagnostic aid tools for pathologists in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMachine learning and other data-driven methods have developed at a prolific rate for industrial applications due to the advent of industrial big data. However, industrial datasets may not be especially well-suited to supervised learning approaches that require extensive domain knowledge in the complete and accurate labeling of datasets. To address these challenges, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed that makes use of partially labeled subsets. The proposed methodology is applied to high-dimensional in-process measurement data, utilizing a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for unsupervised feature extraction. A multiclass extension for semi-supervised anomaly diagnosis is proposed that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) as the basis for anomaly scoring, and the proposed approach intersects the results of targeted one-against-all phases on partially labeled sets to classify faults. Experiments in a case study on semiconductor manufacturing measurement data are performed to explore the relationship between latent features extracted and anomaly detection performance. The application of the proposed algorithm achieves a true positive detection rate of over 90% with false positive rate under 9% for both local and global anomaly types, with these results accomplished while reducing over 99% of the original input data dimensions. In addition, the approach also allows for positive samples to be identified that were previously undetected by human experts. These results are promising for the application of the proposed semi-supervised methodology in real industrial settings.",

To comprehend the cell migration, an adequate quantification for single cell-based analysis is crucial. An automatized approach could alleviate tedious manual analysis, facilitating large-scale drug screening. Supervised deep learning has shown promising outcomes in computerized microscopy image analysis. However, their implication is limited due to the scarcity of carefully annotated data and uncertain deterministic outputs. We compare three deep learning models to study the problem of learning discriminative morphological representations using weakly annotated data for predicting the cell migration modes. We also estimate Bayesian uncertainty to describe the confidence of the probabilistic predictions. Amongst three compared models, DenseNet yielded the best results with a sensitivity of 87.91% ± 13.22 at a false negative rate of 1.26% ± 4.18.",

        "abstract": "AbstractCRISPR technology, combined with single-cell RNA-Seq, has opened the way to large scale pooled perturbation screens, allowing more systematic interrogations of gene functions in cells at scale. However, such Perturb-seq data poses many analysis challenges, due to its high-dimensionality, high level of technical noise, and variable Cas9 efficiency. The single-cell nature of the data also poses its own challenges, as we observe the heterogeneity of phenotypes in the unperturbed cells, along with the effect of the perturbations. All in all, these characteristics make it difficult to discern subtler effects. Existing tools, like mixscape and ContrastiveVI, provide partial solutions, but may oversimplify biological dynamics, or have low power to characterize perturbations with a smaller effect size. Here, we address these limitations by introducing the Supervised Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (SC-VAE). SC-VAE integrates guide RNA identity with gene expression data, ensuring a more discriminative analysis, and adopts the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion as a way to achieve disentangled representations, separating the heterogeneity in the control population from the effect of the perturbations. Evaluation on large-scale data sets highlights SC-VAE’s superior sensitivity in identifying perturbation effects compared to ContrastiveVI, scVI and PCA. The perturbation embeddings better reflect known protein complexes (evaluated on CORUM), while its classifier offers promise in identifying assignment errors and cells escaping the perturbation phenotype. SC-VAE is readily applicable across diverse perturbation data sets.",

Here, we introduce self-supervised learning (SSL) to address the issue of lacking labeled data in material characterization. We propose a generalized SSL-based framework with domain knowledge and demonstrate its robustness to predict the properties of a candidate material with the fewest data. Our numerical results show that the performance of the proposed SSL model can match the commonly-used supervised learning (SL) model with only 5 % of data, and the SSL model is also proven with ease of implementation. Our study paves the way to expand further the usability of ML tools for a broader material science community.",

In this paper, we propose to improve the generalization of RL algorithms through fusing Self-supervised learning into Intrinsic Motivation (SIM). Specifically, SIM boosts representation learning through driving the cross-correlation matrix between the embeddings of augmented and non-augmented samples close to the identity matrix. This aims to increase the similarity between the embedding vectors of a sample and its augmented version while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. Meanwhile, the redundancy reduction based self-supervised loss is converted to an intrinsic reward to further improve generalization in RL via an auxiliary objective. As a general paradigm, SIM can be implemented on top of any RL algorithm. Extensive evaluations have been performed on a diversity of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SIM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits superior generalization capability and sample efficiency.",

        "abstract": " Learning-to-rank (LTR) is a very hot topic of research for information retrieval (IR). LTR framework usually learns the ranking function using available training data that are very cost-effective, time-consuming and biased. When sufficient amount of training data is not available, semi-supervised learning is one of the machine learning paradigms that can be applied to get pseudo label from unlabeled data. Cluster and label is a basic approach for semi-supervised learning to identify the high-density region in data space which is mainly used to support the supervised learning. However, clustering with conventional method may lead to prediction performance which is worse than supervised learning algorithms for application of LTR. Thus, we propose rank preserving clustering (RPC) with PLocalSearch and get pseudo label for unlabeled data. We present semi-supervised learning that adopts clustering-based transductive method and combine it with nonmeasure specific listwise approach to learn the LTR model. Moreover, each cluster follows the multi-task learning to avoid optimization of multiple loss functions. It reduces the training complexity of adopted listwise approach from an exponential order to a polynomial order. Empirical analysis on the standard datasets (LETOR) shows that the proposed model gives better results as compared to other state-of-the-arts. ",

Automatic tumor detection plays a significant role in the clinic. However, training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection needs a large quantity of labeled data. It is time‐consuming and expensive to manually annotate tumor positions in ABUS images. In this paper, a novel semi‐supervised learning EfficientDet (SSL‐E) model is proposed for ABUS tumor detection. Our SSL‐E model solves the tumor detection problem from high similarity and serious unbalance between tumors and backgrounds. Considering the image contrast variation and tumor scale variations in ABUS images, color transformation and geometric transformation are employed for data augmentations. Then the consistency between image and its augmented version is developed, thus the robustness of the detector can be improved. Aiming at the problem of serious unbalance between tumors and backgrounds, a novel copy‐paste synthesis strategy is designed, which can generate more tumor samples and enhance tumor diversity. This method is tested on 68 tumor volumes and 68 normal volumes, including 43,248 slices (1683 tumor slices and 41,565 normal slices). It obtains a promising result with sensitivity of 90.2% and false positives per image (FPs/I) at 0.15.",

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm that combines consistency regularization and pseudo-labels to help identify appliances with a small amount of labeled data and some unlabeled data.\nIn addition, given the different learning difficulties of different appliances among users, for example, the feature learning difficulty of multi-state appliances is often higher than that of single-state appliances. Therefore, we employ that the threshold values of different appliance classes be changed in a flexible way at each time step so that the informative unlabeled data and their pseudo-labels can be passed.\nWe have carried out simulation experiments on public dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better appliance identification results than the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Agriculture is one of the major fields in India that has been overlooked by technical touch. The application of artificial intelligence derivatives such as machine learning and deep learning to agricultural practises aids in crop production and soil health maintenance. The health of an agricultural field is primarily concerned with the preservation of soil nutrients, such as chemical and physical properties, by properly transmitting supplements. When soil health is managed scientifically, it gradually aids in high yield production and the long life of cultivation land. The soil data collected from soil testing centres is used to build the ontology. Ontology is constructed in such a way that it demonstrates the knowledge and relationship between soil and its chemical nutrients. The knowledge base is then used to connect the nutrient and soil type. Machine learning comes with useful and best-in-class algorithms for managing soil health and classifying it into healthy and unhealthy categories. In this study, obvious machine learning algorithms are used to efficiently classify the soil into two classes: healthy and unhealthy. To classify the data, algorithms such as logistic regression, Decision tree, Random tree classifier, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost were used, and their algorithmic efficiency was increased through hyper parameter tuning using various techniques.

        "abstract": "Summary\nA fundamental challenge in semi-supervised learning lies in the observed data’s disproportional size when compared with the size of the data collected with missing outcomes. An implicit understanding is that the dataset with missing outcomes, being significantly larger, ought to improve estimation and inference. However, it is unclear to what extent this is correct. We illustrate one clear benefit: root-$n$ inference of the outcome’s mean is possible while only requiring a consistent estimation of the outcome, possibly at a rate slower than root $n$. This is achieved by a novel $k$-fold, cross-fitted, double robust estimator. We discuss both linear and nonlinear outcomes. Such an estimator is particularly suited for models that naturally do not admit root-$n$ consistency, such as high-dimensional, nonparametric or semiparametric models. We apply our methods to estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.",

Existing approaches make multi-label prediction by exploiting the incomplete logical labels directly without considering the relative importance of each label to an instance. In this paper, a novel two-stage strategy named Weakly Supervised Multi-label Learning via Label Enhancement (WSMLLE) is proposed to learn from weakly supervised data via label enhancement. Firstly, the relative importance of each label, i.e., the description degrees are recovered by leveraging the structural information in the feature space and local correlations learned from the label space. Then, a tailored multi-label predictive model is induced by learning from the training instances with the recovered description degrees. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt to unify the complement of the missing labels and the recovery of the description degrees into the same framework. Extensive experiments across a wide range of real-world datasets clearly validate the superiority of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor biopsies or surgical specimens can offer valuable insights into TIME, but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultra-high resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However, studies on revealing TIME from pathology images are still limited.In this paper, we proposed a novel weakly supervised contrastive learning model to deduce tumor immune microenvironment features from whole slide images (WSIs) of H&E stained pathological sections. The high-resolution WSIs are split into tiles, and then contrastive learning is applied to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level, we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive downstream experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that our computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor infiltrating immune cells, particularly the infiltration level of macrophages, as well as the immune subtypes and biomarker gene expression levels. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision, establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology, thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images.",

        "abstract": "A considerable number of approaches based on consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have been proposed in Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) so far. These approaches significantly enhance the SSL methods by effectively utilizing large amount of unlabeled data to improve the model’s performance. However, existing methods may fail to utilize the unlabeled data more efficiently, mainly due to the challenges faced in pseudo-label estimation. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the impact of the pseudo-label estimation method on training the SSL model. Furthermore, we emphasize that an effective pseudo-label estimation method should reflect the difference of recognition performance among samples from different categories, and also ensure the maintenance of both high-quantity and high-quality pseudo-labels during each training iteration. Based on above analysis, we propose DYMatch, an innovative SSL method employing a dynamic estimation process. Firstly, a dynamic pseudo-label estimation method based on Gaussian mixture model is proposed to dynamically estimate the confidence threshold on different categories. Secondly, a feature-correlation consistency regularization method is introduced to further enhance the learning on unlabeled data. The experimental results show that DYMatch is a simple and effective SSL method, especially when the labeled data is limited.",

This removal results in a lack of ongoing training data and impairs the ability to improve recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel semi-supervised learning approach for NILM systems. The approach is based on a previously proposed temporal convolutional network-conditional random field (TCN-CRF) model. It uses optimal interval filtering and unanimous voting to control the quality of pseudo-labels. The approach identifies high-precision segments in the sequence-to-sequence algorithm as semi-supervised learning targets and generates pseudo-labels, allowing for continuous self-supervised learning and sustained improvement in recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can effectively combine unlabeled data to improve model accuracy, and achieve up to 14% highest improvement in algorithm accuracy over fully self-supervised methods in small sample training.</p>",

        "abstract": "Machine learning-based indoor localization used to suffer from the collection, construction, and maintenance of labeled training databases for practical implementation. Semi-supervised learning methods have been developed as efficient indoor localization methods to reduce use of labeled training data. To boost the efficiency and the accuracy of indoor localization, this paper proposes a new time-series semi-supervised learning algorithm. The key aspect of the developed method, which distinguishes it from conventional semi-supervised algorithms, is the use of unlabeled data. The learning algorithm finds spatio-temporal relationships in the unlabeled data, and pseudolabels are generated to compensate for the lack of labeled training data. In the next step, another balancing-optimization learning algorithm learns a positioning model. The proposed method is evaluated for estimating the location of a smartphone user by using a Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurement. The experimental results show that the developed learning algorithm outperforms some existing semi-supervised algorithms according to the variation of the number of training data and access points. Also, the proposed method is discussed in terms of why it gives better performance, by the analysis of the impact of the learning parameters. Moreover, the extended localization scheme in conjunction with a particle filter is executed to include additional information, such as a floor plan.",

        "abstract": "From a single meter that measures the entire home’s electrical demand, energy disaggregation calculates appliance-by-appliance electricity consumption. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), also known as energy disaggregation, tries to decompose aggregated energy consumption data and estimate each appliance’s contribution. Recently, methodologies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been proposed commonly used in these models, which can be expensive to run on a server or prohibitive when the target device has limited capabilities. AI-based models are typically computationally expensive and require a lot of storage. It is not easy to reduce the computing cost and size of a neural network without sacrificing performance. This study proposed an efficient non-parametric supervised machine learning network (ENSML) architecture with a smaller size, and a quick inference time without sacrificing performance. The proposed architecture can maximise energy disaggregation performance and predict new observations based on past ones. The results showed that employing the ENSML model considerably increased the accuracy of energy prediction in 99 percent of cases.",

Up to now, a large amount of unsupervised dimension reduction methods have been proposed and studied. However, there is no specific review focusing on the supervised dimension reduction problem. Most studies performed classification or regression after unsupervised dimension reduction methods. However, we recognize the following advantages if learning the low-dimensional representation and the classification/regression model simultaneously: high accuracy and effective representation. Considering classification or regression as being the main goal of dimension reduction, the purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the current developments in the field into three main classes: PCA-based, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based, and manifold-based supervised dimension reduction methods, as well as provide elaborated discussions on their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we outline a dozen open problems that can be further explored to advance the development of this topic.",

        "abstract": " A vast majority of computation in the brain is performed by spiking neural networks. Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in silico. Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multilayer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three-factor learning rule capable of training multilayer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric, and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike time patterns.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImproving resource utilization is an important goal of high-performance computing systems of supercomputing centers. In order to meet this goal, the job scheduler of high-performance computing systems often use backfilling scheduling to fill short-time jobs into the gaps of jobs at the front of the queue. Backfilling scheduling needs to obtain the running time of the job. In the past, the job running times are usually given by users and often far exceeded the actual running time of the job, which leads to inaccurate backfilling and a waste of computing resources. In particular, when the predicted job running time is lower than the actual time, the damage caused to the utilization of the system’s computing resources becomes more serious. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of the job running time is crucial to the utilization of system resources. The use of machine learning methods can make more accurate predictions of the job running time. Aiming at the parallel application of aerodynamics, we propose a job running time prediction framework SU combining supervised and unsupervised learning, and verifies it on the real historical data of the high-performance computing systems of China Aerodynamics Research and Development Center(CARDC). The experimental results show that SU has a high prediction accuracy(80.46%) and a low underestimation rate(24.85%).",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of breast masses is an essential step in computer aided diagnosis of breast cancer. The scarcity of annotated training data greatly hinders the model’s generalization ability, especially for the deep learning based methods. However, high-quality image-level annotations are time-consuming and cumbersome in medical image analysis scenarios. In addition, a large amount of weak annotations is under-utilized which comprise common anatomy features. To this end, inspired by teacher-student networks, we propose an Anatomy-Aware Weakly-Supervised learning Network (AAWS-Net) for extracting useful information from mammograms with weak annotations for efficient and accurate breast mass segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a weakly-supervised learning strategy in the Teacher to extract anatomy structure from mammograms with weak annotations by reconstructing the original image. Besides, knowledge distillation is used to suggest morphological differences between benign and malignant masses. Moreover, the prior knowledge learned from the Teacher is introduced to the Student in an end-to-end way, which improves the ability of the student network to locate and segment masses. Experiments on CBIS-DDSM have shown that our method yields promising performance compared with state-of-the-art alternative models for breast mass segmentation in terms of segmentation accuracy and IoU.",

For the non-operative diagnosis of breast carcinoma, core needle biopsy has been widely used in recent years for the evaluation of histopathological features, as it can provide a definitive diagnosis between IDC and benign lesion (e.g., fibroadenoma), and it is cost effective. Due to its widespread use, it could potentially benefit from the use of AI-based tools to aid pathologists in their pathological diagnosis workflows. In this paper, we trained invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) whole slide image (WSI) classification models using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning. We evaluated the models on a core needle biopsy (n = 522) test set as well as three surgical test sets (n = 1129) obtaining ROC AUCs in the range of 0.95–0.98. The promising results demonstrate the potential of applying such models as diagnostic aid tools for pathologists in clinical practice.",

Several machine learning models, such as random forests, and k-Nearest Neighbours have been proposed for the prediction of geospatial data in marine geosciences, but face significant challenges such as the limited amount of labels for training purposes, skewed data distribution, a large number of features etc. Previous model predictions show deviation in the global sediment budget, a parameter used to determine a model's predicitve validity, revealing the lack of accurate representation of sedimentation rate by the state of the art models.&#160;Here we present a semi-supervised deep learning methodology to improve the prediction of sedimentation rates, making use of around 9x106&#160; unlabelled data points. The semi-supervised neural network implementation has two parts: an unsupervised pretraining using an encoder-decoder network. The encoder with the optimized weights from the unsupervised training is then taken out and fitted with layers that lead to the target dimension. This network is then fine-tuned with 2782 labelled data points, which are observed sedimentation rates from peer-reviewed sources. The fine-tuned model then predicts the rate and quantity of sediment accumulating on the ocean floor, globally.The developed semi-supervised neural network provide better predictions than supervised models trained only on labelled data. The predictions from the semi-supervised neural network are compared with that of the supervised neural network with and without dimensionality reduction(using Principle Component Analysis).",

In this paper, residential MGs, commercial MGs, and industrial MGs are considered as a community of NMG. The loads’ profiles are split into multiple sections to evaluate the maximum load demand (MLD). Based on the optimal operation of each MG, the operating reserve (OR) of the MGs is calculated for each section. Then, the self-organizing map as a supervised and a k-means algorithm as an unsupervised learning clustering method is utilized to cluster the MGs and effective energy-sharing. The clustering is based on the maximum load demand of MGs and the operating reserve of dispatchable energy sources, and the goal is to provide a more efficient system with high reliability. Eventually, the performance of this energy management and its benefits to the whole system is surveyed effectively. The proposed energy management system offers a more reliable system due to the possibility of reserved energy for MGs in case of power outage variation or shortage of power.",

        "abstract": "Specific emitter identification (SEI) is extracting the features of the received radio signals and determining the emitter individuals that generate the signals. Although deep learning-based methods have been effectively applied for SEI, their performance declines dramatically with the smaller number of labeled training samples and in the presence of significant noise. To address this issue, we propose an improved Bootstrap Your Own Late (BYOL) self-supervised learning scheme to fully exploit the unlabeled samples, which comprises the pretext task adopting contrastive learning conception and the downstream task. We designed three optimized data augmentation methods for communication signals in the former task to serve the contrastive concept. We built two neural networks, online and target networks, which interact and learn from each other. The proposed scheme demonstrates the generality of handling the small and sufficient sample cases across a wide range from 10 to 400, being labeled in each group. The experiment also shows promising accuracy and robustness where the recognition results increase at 3-8% from 3 to 7 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our scheme can accurately identify the individual emitter in a complicated electromagnetic environment.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from time resolved gene expression measurements is a key challenge in systems biology with applications in health and disease. While the most popular network inference methods are based on unsupervised learning approaches, supervised learning methods have proven their potential for superior reconstruction performance. However, obtaining the appropriate volume of informative training data constitutes a key limitation for the success of such methods.Here, we introduce a supervised learning approach to detect gene-gene regulation based on exclusively synthetic training data, termed surrogate learning, and show its performance for synthetic and experimental time-series. We systematically investigate different simulation configurations of biologically representative time-series of transcripts and augmentation of the data with a measurement model. We compare the resulting synthetic datasets to experimental data, and evaluate classifiers trained on them for detection of gene-gene regulation from experimental time-series. For classifiers, we consider hybrid convolutional recurrent neural networks, random forests and logistic regression, and evaluate the reconstruction performance of different simulation settings, data pre-processing and classifiers.When training and test time-courses are generated from the same distribution, we find that the largest tested neural network architecture achieves the best performance of 0.448 ± 0.047 (mean ± std) in maximally achievable F1 score over all datasets outperforming random forests by 32.4 % ± 14 % (mean ± std). Reconstruction performance is sensitive to discrepancies between synthetic training and test data, highlighting the importance of matching training and test data domains. For an experimental gene expression dataset from E.coli, we find that training data generated with measurement model, multi-gene perturbations, but without data standardization is best suited for training classifiers for network reconstruction from the experimental test data. We further demonstrate superiority to multiple unsupervised, state-of-the-art methods for networks comprising 20 genes of the experimental data from E.coli (average AUPR best supervised = 0.22 vs best unsupervised = 0.07).We expect the proposed surrogate learning approach to be broadly applicable. It alleviates the requirement for large, difficult to attain volumes of experimental training data and instead relies on easily accessible synthetic data. Successful application for new experimental conditions and other data types is only limited by the automatable and scalable process of designing simulations which generate suitable synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "<p>With the advent of intelligent systems, we are still facing a high number of fatal traffic accidents. Driver assistance systems can significantly reduce this rate. For example, when a driver uses a turn signal, driver assistance systems alert the object's presence in blind spot areas. Camera-based driver assistance systems for blind spots usually alert by detecting objects, including vehicles, in image frames. Based on a more dynamic dangerous situation classification for lane changing and turning to the sides, we propose an efficient blind-spot warning system that works with a single camera sensor for each side. Our contribution consists of two sections. First, we take a deeper look at classifying dangerous and safe situations in a dynamic environment with moving objects. Second, to distinguish dangerous situations from safe conditions, we install a pre-trained SOTA object detector to track vehicles in consecutive frames and then estimate the distances of tracked cars by a 6% mean percentage error rate. In addition, to detect objects in blind spots, the proposed system uses cars' relative velocity to warn dangerous situations. This classification process is not real-time. So, in the second section, we propose a tiny model as a driver assistance system for the blind spot that works in real-time. This tiny model feeds optical flow into CNN layers. This vision-based system uses self-supervised learning without the necessity of the labeled data. It shows 97% accuracy and can detect dangerous situations as a real-time system.</p>",

        "abstract": "In semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), a few labeled target samples of each class help the model to transfer knowledge representation from the fully labeled source domain to the target domain. Many existing methods ignore the benefits of making full use of the labeled target samples from multi-level. To make better use of this additional data, we propose a novel Prototype-based Multi-level Learning (ProML) framework to better tap the potential of labeled target samples. To achieve intra-domain adaptation, we first introduce a pseudo-label aggregation based on the intra-domain optimal transport to help the model align the feature distribution of unlabeled target samples and the prototype. At the inter-domain level, we propose a cross-domain alignment loss to help the model use the target prototype for cross-domain knowledge transfer. We further propose a dual consistency based on prototype similarity and linear classifier to promote discriminative learning of compact target feature representation at the batch level. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including DomainNet, VisDA2017, and Office-Home, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in SSDA.

Most existing FBP methods are based on supervised solutions using geometric or deep features. Semi-supervised learning for FBP is an almost unexplored research area. In this work, we propose a graph-based semi-supervised method in which multiple graphs are constructed to find the appropriate graph representation of the face images (with and without scores). The proposed method combines both geometric and deep feature-based graphs to produce a high-level representation of face images instead of using a single face descriptor and also improves the discriminative ability of graph-based score propagation methods. In addition to the data graph, our proposed approach fuses an additional graph adaptively built on the predicted beauty values. Experimental results on the SCUTFBP-5500 facial beauty dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "This study employs a supervised learning method to predict the tunnel boring machine (TBM) penetration rate (PR) with high accuracy. To this end, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is optimized based on two swarm intelligence algorithms, i.e., the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). Three other machine learning models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models, are also developed as the drawback. A database created in Shenzhen (China), comprising 503 entries and featuring 10 input variables and 1 output variable, was utilized to train and test the prediction models. The model development results indicate that the use of SSA and WOA has the potential to improve the XGBoost model performance in predicting the TBM performance. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed WOA-XGBoost model has achieved the most satisfactory performance by resulting in the most reliable prediction accuracy of the four performance indices. This research serves as a compelling illustration of how combined approaches, such as supervised learning methods and swarm intelligence algorithms, can enhance TBM prediction performance and can provide a reference when solving other related engineering problems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs safety is one of the most important properties of drugs, chemical toxicology prediction has received increasing attentions in the drug discovery research. Traditionally, researchers rely on in vitro and in vivo experiments to test the toxicity of chemical compounds. However, not only are these experiments time consuming and costly, but experiments that involve animal testing are increasingly subject to ethical concerns. While traditional machine learning (ML) methods have been used in the field with some success, the limited availability of annotated toxicity data is the major hurdle for further improving model performance. Inspired by the success of semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, we propose a Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCN) to predict chemical toxicity and trained the network by the Mean Teacher (MT) SSL algorithm. Using the Tox21 data, our optimal SSL-GCN models for predicting the twelve toxicological endpoints achieve an average ROC-AUC score of 0.757 in the test set, which is a 6% improvement over GCN models trained by supervised learning and conventional ML methods. Our SSL-GCN models also exhibit superior performance when compared to models constructed using the built-in DeepChem ML methods. This study demonstrates that SSL can increase the prediction power of models by learning from unannotated data. The optimal unannotated to annotated data ratio ranges between 1:1 and 4:1. This study demonstrates the success of SSL in chemical toxicity prediction; the same technique is expected to be beneficial to other chemical property prediction tasks by utilizing existing large chemical databases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nCurrent home automation systems allow remote monitoring and control of smart home devices. However, the problem caused by autonomous or self-controlled home automation is that predicting inhabitant behaviour and desires in every situation with 100% accuracy is unrealistic, at least for now. Therefore, the actual implementation of autonomous home automation may prove daunting and rigid for some users. Additionally, inhabitants want to be in control and want control over when and how things are done, this is due to their anxiety about losing control in favor of autonomous home automation. A personalized recommendation system for smart home residents with a certain degree of confidence is therefore ideal. This paper proposes a methodology to build a context-aware personalised recommender system for smart home automation. We suggest a predictive model for useful automation services of relevant smart home devices that smart home residents’ may wish to perform, by capturing the user’s current state and contextual preferences at that time. This is done by applying, in the first stage, an unsupervised algorithm to extract rules of behavior based on the resident’s previous interactions and passively captured in their daily lives by IoT-enabled sensors, and then, in the second stage, applying a supervised algorithm to recommend automation services in future instances when the actual behaviour of the user and context matches the established rules. Evaluations of smart home datasets show that the system produces correct recommendations with an average accuracy of 86.99%, a recall of 76.06%, and a precision of 82.67%.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) has been used in many important applications to study stochastic processes with the evolution of the probability density function (pdf). Previous studies on FPE mainly focus on solving the forward problem which is to predict the time-evolution of the pdf from the underlying FPE terms. However, in many applications the FPE terms are usually unknown and roughly estimated, and solving the forward problem becomes more challenging. In this work, we take a different approach of starting with the observed pdfs to recover the FPE terms using a self-supervised machine learning method. This approach, known as the inverse problem, has the advantage of requiring minimal assumptions on the FPE terms and allows data-driven scientific discovery of unknown FPE mechanisms. Specifically, we propose an FPE-based neural network (FPE-NN) which directly incorporates the FPE terms as neural network weights. By training the network on observed pdfs, we recover the FPE terms. Additionally, to account for noise in real-world observations, FPE-NN is able to denoise the observed pdfs by training the pdfs alongside the network weights. Our experimental results on various forms of FPE show that FPE-NN can accurately recover FPE terms and denoising the pdf plays an essential role.",

        "abstract": "Natural and efficient communication with humans requires artificial agents that are able to understand the meaning of natural language. However, understanding natural language is non-trivial and requires proper grounding mechanisms to create links between words and corresponding perceptual information. Since the introduction of the “Symbol Grounding Problem” in 1990, many different grounding approaches have been proposed that either employed supervised or unsupervised learning mechanisms. The latter have the advantage that no other agent is required to learn the correct groundings, while the former are often more sample-efficient and accurate but require the support of another agent, like a human or another artificial agent. Although combining both paradigms seems natural, it has not achieved much attention. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid grounding framework which combines both learning paradigms so that it is able to utilize support from a tutor, if available, while it can still learn when no support is provided. Additionally, the framework has been designed to learn in a continuous and open-ended manner so that no explicit training phase is required. The proposed framework is evaluated through two different grounding scenarios and its unsupervised grounding component is compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised Bayesian grounding framework, while the benefit of combining both paradigms is evaluated through the analysis of different feedback rates. The obtained results show that the employed unsupervised grounding mechanism outperforms the baseline in terms of accuracy, transparency, and deployability and that combining both paradigms increases both the sample-efficiency as well as the accuracy of purely unsupervised grounding, while it ensures that the framework is still able to learn the correct mappings, when no supervision is available.",

        "abstract": "The service life of aluminium electrolytic capacitors is becoming a critical design factor in power supplies. Despite rising power density demands, electrolytic capacitors and switching devices are the two most common parts of the power supply that age (deteriorate) under normal and diverse working conditions. This study presents a fault diagnostics framework integrated with long-term frequency for a switched-mode power supply aluminium electrolytic capacitor (SMPS-AEC). Long-term frequency condition monitoring (CM) was achieved using the advanced HIOKI LCR meter at 8 MHz. The data acquired during the experimental study can help to achieve the needed paradigm from various measured characteristics of the SMPS/power converter component to detect anomalies between the capacitors selected for analysis. The CM procedure in this study was bound by the electrical parameters—capacitance (Cs), equivalent series resistance (ESR), dissipation factor (DF), and impedance (Z)—-acting as degradation techniques during physical and chemical changes of the capacitors. Furthermore, the proposed methodology was carried out using statistical feature extraction and filter-based correlation for feature selection, followed by training, testing and validation using the selected supervised learning algorithms. The resulting assessment revealed that with increased data capacity, an improved performance was achieved across the chosen algorithms out of which the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) had the best average accuracy (98.40%) and lowest computational cost (0.31 s) across all the electrical parameters. Further assessment was carried out using the fault visualization aided by principal component analysis (PCA) to validate and decide on the best electrical parameters for the CM technique.",

        "abstract": "AbstractInferring past demographic history of natural populations from genomic data is of central concern in many studies across research fields. Previously, our group had developed dadi, a widely used demographic history inference method based on the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) and maximum composite likelihood optimization. However, dadi’s optimization procedure can be computationally expensive. Here, we developed donni (demography optimization via neural network inference), a new inference method based on dadi that is more efficient while maintaining comparable inference accuracy. For each dadi-supported demographic model, donni simulates the expected AFS for a range of model parameters then trains a set of Mean Variance Estimation neural networks using the simulated AFS. Trained networks can then be used to instantaneously infer the model parameters from future input data AFS. We demonstrated that for many demographic models, donni can infer some parameters, such as population size changes, very well and other parameters, such as migration rates and times of demographic events, fairly well. Importantly, donni provides both parameter and confidence interval estimates from input AFS with accuracy comparable to parameters inferred by dadi’s likelihood optimization while bypassing its long and computationally intensive evaluation process. donni’s performance demonstrates that supervised machine learning algorithms may be a promising avenue for developing more sustainable and computationally efficient demographic history inference methods.",

Traditional approaches screen compounds for their ability to shift disease phenotypes toward healthy phenotypes, but these end point-based screens lack an atlas-like mapping between phenotype and cell state that covers the full spectrum of possible phenotypic responses. In this study, we present MitoSpace: a novel mitochondrial phenotypic atlas that leverages self-supervised deep learning to create a semantically meaningful latent space from images without relying on any data labels for training. Our approach employs a dataset of ∼100,000 microscopy images of Cal27 and HeLa cells treated with 25 drugs affecting mitochondria, but can be generalized to any cell type, cell organelle, or drug library with no changes to the methodology. We demonstrate how MitoSpace enhances our understanding of the range of mitochondrial phenotypes induced by pharmacological interventions. We find that i) self-supervised learning can automatically uncover the semantic landscape of drug induced latent mitochondrial phenotypes and can map individual cells to the correct functional area of the drug they are treated with, ii) the traditional classification of mitochondrial morphology along a fragmented to fused axis is more complex than previously thought, with additional axes being identified, and iii) latent spaces trained in a self-supervised manner are superior to those trained with supervised models, and generalize to other cell types and drug conditions without explicit training on those cell types or drug conditions. Future applications of MitoSpace include creating mitochondrial biomarkers for drug discovery and determining the effects of unknown drugs and diseases for diagnostic purposes.",

It is capable of adopting self-defined pseudolabels as supervision and use the learned representations for several downstream tasks. Specifically, contrastive learning has recently become a dominant component in self-supervised learning for computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and other domains. It aims at embedding augmented versions of the same sample close to each other while trying to push away embeddings from different samples. This paper provides an extensive review of self-supervised methods that follow the contrastive approach. The work explains commonly used pretext tasks in a contrastive learning setup, followed by different architectures that have been proposed so far. Next, we present a performance comparison of different methods for multiple downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, and action recognition.

        "abstract": "When specifying a predictive model for classification, variable selection (or subset selection) is one of the most important steps for researchers to consider. Reducing the necessary number of variables in a prediction model is vital for many reasons, including reducing the burden of data collection and increasing model efficiency and generalizability. The pool of variable selection methods from which to choose is large, and researchers often struggle to identify which method they should use given the specific features of their data set. Yet, there is a scarcity of literature available to guide researchers in their choice; the literature centers on comparing different implementations of a given method rather than comparing different methodologies under varying data features. Through the implementation of a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation and the application to one empirical dataset we evaluated the prediction error rates, area under the receiver operating curve, number of variables selected, computation times, and true positive rates of five different variable selection methods using R under varying parameterizations (i.e., default vs. grid tuning): the genetic algorithm (ga), LASSO (glmnet), Elastic Net (glmnet), Support Vector Machines (svmfs), and random forest (Boruta). Performance measures did not converge upon a single best method; as such, researchers should guide their method selection based on what measure of performance they deem most important. Results did show that the SVM approach performed worst and researchers are advised to use other methods. LASSO and Elastic Net performed well in most conditions, but researchers may face non-convergence problems if these methods are chosen. Random forest performed well across simulation conditions. Based on our study, the genetic algorithm is the most widely applicable method, exhibiting minimum error rates in hold-out samples when compared to other variable selection methods.",

Many extant NIDSs actively work against various intrusions, but there are still a number of performance issues including high false alarm rates, and numerous undetected attacks. To keep up with these attacks, some of the academic researchers turned towards machine learning (ML) techniques to create software that automatically predict intrusive and abnormal traffic, another approach is to utilize ML algorithms in enhancing Traditional NIDSs which is a more feasible solution since they are widely spread. To upgrade the detection rates of current NIDSs, thorough analyses are essential to identify where ML predictors outperform them. The first step is to provide assessment of most used NIDS worldwide, Snort, and comparing its performance with ML classifiers. This paper provides an empirical study to evaluate performance of Snort and four supervised ML classifiers, KNN, Decision Tree, Bayesian net and Naïve Bays against network attacks, probing, Brute force and DoS. By measuring Snort metric, True Alarm Rate, F-measure, Precision and Accuracy and compares them with the same metrics conducted from applying ML algorithms using Weka tool. ML classifiers show an elevated performance with over 99% correctly classified instances for most algorithms, While Snort intrusion detection system shows a degraded classification of about 25% correctly classified instances, hence identifying Snort weaknesses towards certain attack types and giving leads on how to overcome those weaknesses. \nes.",

        "abstract": "<p>With the advent of intelligent systems, we are still facing a high number of fatal traffic accidents. Driver assistance systems can significantly reduce this rate. For example, when a driver uses a turn signal, driver assistance systems alert the object's presence in blind spot areas. Camera-based driver assistance systems for blind spots usually alert by detecting objects, including vehicles, in image frames. Based on a more dynamic dangerous situation classification for lane changing and turning to the sides, we propose an efficient blind-spot warning system that works with a single camera sensor for each side. Our contribution consists of two sections. First, we take a deeper look at classifying dangerous and safe situations in a dynamic environment with moving objects. Second, to distinguish dangerous situations from safe conditions, we install a pre-trained SOTA object detector to track vehicles in consecutive frames and then estimate the distances of tracked cars by a 6% mean percentage error rate. In addition, to detect objects in blind spots, the proposed system uses cars' relative velocity to warn dangerous situations. This classification process is not real-time. So, in the second section, we propose a tiny model as a driver assistance system for the blind spot that works in real-time. This tiny model feeds optical flow into CNN layers. This vision-based system uses self-supervised learning without the necessity of the labeled data. It shows 97% accuracy and can detect dangerous situations as a real-time system.</p>",

As direct sensors for detection of these nitro-aromatic compounds are not available, an array of four gas sensors, sensing the aroma of explosives, along with a temperature and humidity sensor are exposed to varying concentrations of the explosives. An arduino based data acquisition system acquires the sensor arrays response and transmits it to a computer. Feature parameters of Area, Slope and Relative Response are extracted from the sensor response and are used to train and test for presence of explosives using supervised learning algorithms. After a comparative performance study of various such algorithms, the feedforward neural network with resilient backpropagation is employed for the detection of these explosives. The system is tested for 51 cases, where the explosive is mixed with air and not a pattern gas. The system correctly identified the presence of nitrotoluene and nitrobenzene with an accuracy of 94%. A user interface is developed for easy use of the system, which allows the user to set the training mode or testing mode of the system. This interface, pops up a message when it detects the presence of nitrobenzene or nitrotoluene before the explosion.",

In this paper, we introduce a practical and general method to test such suspected symmetries in data, with minimal external input. Self-supervision, which derives learning objectives from data without external labelling, is used to train models to predict 'which is real?' between real data and symmetrically transformed alternatives. If these models make successful predictions in independent tests, then they challenge the targeted symmetries. Crucially, our method handles filtered data, which often arise from inefficiencies or deliberate selections, and which could give the illusion of asymmetry if mistreated. We use examples to demonstrate how the method works and how the models' predictions can be interpreted. Code and data are available at https://zenodo.org/record/6861702.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nImproving resource utilization is an important goal of high-performance computing systems of supercomputing centers. In order to meet this goal, the job scheduler of high-performance computing systems often use backfilling scheduling to fill short-time jobs into the gaps of jobs at the front of the queue. Backfilling scheduling needs to obtain the running time of the job. In the past, the job running times are usually given by users and often far exceeded the actual running time of the job, which leads to inaccurate backfilling and a waste of computing resources. In particular, when the predicted job running time is lower than the actual time, the damage caused to the utilization of the system’s computing resources becomes more serious. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of the job running time is crucial to the utilization of system resources. The use of machine learning methods can make more accurate predictions of the job running time. Aiming at the parallel application of aerodynamics, we propose a job running time prediction framework SU combining supervised and unsupervised learning, and verifies it on the real historical data of the high-performance computing systems of China erodynamics Research and Development Center(CARDC). The experimental results show that SU has a high prediction accuracy(80.46%) and a low underestimation rate(24.85%).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDistributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology for earthquake monitoring and subsurface imaging. The recorded seismic signals by DAS have several distinct characteristics, such as unknown coupling effects, strong anthropogenic noise, and ultra-dense spatial sampling. These aspects differ from conventional seismic data recorded by seismic networks, making it challenging to utilize DAS at present for seismic monitoring. New data analysis algorithms are needed to extract useful information from DAS data, such as determining the first arrival times of P and S phases for earthquake monitoring and tomography. Previous studies on conventional seismic data demonstrated that deep learning models could achieve performance close to human analysts in picking seismic phases after training on large datasets of manual labels. However, phase picking on DAS data is still a difficult problem due to the lack of manual labels. Further, the differences in mathematical structure between these two data formats, i.e., ultra-dense DAS arrays and sparse seismic networks, make model fine-tuning or transfer learning difficult to implement on DAS data. In this work, we design a new approach using semi-supervised learning to solve the phase-picking task on DAS arrays. We use a pre-trained PhaseNet model as a teacher network to generate noisy labels of P and S arrivals on DAS data and apply the Gaussian mixture model phase association (GaMMA) method to refine these noisy labels to build training datasets. We develop a new deep learning model, PhaseNet-DAS, to process the 2D spatial-temporal data of DAS arrays and train the model using DAS arrays at Long Valley and Ridgecrest, California. The new deep learning model achieves high picking accuracy and good earthquake detection performance. We then apply the model to process continuous data and build earthquake catalogs directly from DAS recording. Our approach using semi-supervised learning provides a way to build effective deep learning models for DAS, which have the potential to improve earthquake monitoring using large-scale fiber networks.",

In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to intelligent fault diagnosis techniques based on deep learning. However, most of these methods are based on supervised learning with a large amount of labeled data, which is a challenge for industrial applications. To reduce the dependence on labeled data, a self-supervised joint learning (SSJL) fault diagnosis method based on three-channel vibration images is proposed. The method combines self-supervised learning with supervised learning, makes full use of unlabeled data to learn fault features, and further improves the feature recognition rate by transforming the data into three-channel vibration images. The validity of the method was verified using two typical data sets from a motor bearing. Experimental results show that this method has higher diagnostic accuracy for small quantities of labeled data and is superior to the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDrug–drug interactions (DDI) are a critical concern in healthcare due to their potential to cause adverse effects and compromise patient safety. Supervised machine learning models for DDI prediction need to be optimized to learn abstract, transferable features, and generalize to larger chemical spaces, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled DDI data. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we present SMR–DDI, a self-supervised framework that leverages contrastive learning to embed drugs into a scaffold-based feature space. Molecular scaffolds represent the core structural motifs that drive pharmacological activities, making them valuable for learning informative representations. Specifically, we pre-trained SMR–DDI on a large-scale unlabeled molecular dataset. We generated augmented views for each molecule via SMILES enumeration and optimized the embedding process through contrastive loss minimization between views. This enables the model to capture relevant and robust molecular features while reducing noise. We then transfer the learned representations for the downstream prediction of DDI. Experiments show that the new feature space has comparable expressivity to state-of-the-art molecular representations and achieved competitive DDI prediction results while training on less data. Additional investigations also revealed that pre-training on more extensive and diverse unlabeled molecular datasets improved the model’s capability to embed molecules more effectively. Our results highlight contrastive learning as a promising approach for DDI prediction that can identify potentially hazardous drug combinations using only structural information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this work, we propose an approach to predict multiple design parameters of products using 2D images and supervised learning techniques. Fully parametric 2D or 3D vector representations have a high degree of flexibility since they are generally capable of morphing between all designs in the design space. A reverse design method is applied to parametrically designed products to extract design knowledge from existing designs and apply it to future designs. The goal of this research is to develop an accurate and efficient predictive model for multiple design parameters. The paper introduces several novel aspects, including learning parametric patterns from a 2D model dataset and using them to predict design parameters for new engineering systems. Additionally, the paper proposes a finetuning multilabel approach for predicting multiple design parameters of different types simultaneously, including binary and continuous parameters. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high prediction accuracy and suggest that the proposed approach can be used as a reliable tool for predicting multiple design parameters of products in practical engineering design scenarios from only 2D images, potentially allowing designer to iterate through more existing engineering designs.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in supervised learning tasks but are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without explicit labels. Information theory has shaped deep neural networks, particularly the information bottleneck principle. This principle optimizes the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning approaches from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing a unified framework that encapsulates the self-supervised information-theoretic learning problem. This framework includes multiple encoders and decoders, suggesting that all existing work on self-supervised learning can be seen as specific instances. We aim to unify these approaches to understand their underlying principles better and address the main challenge: many works present different frameworks with differing theories that may seem contradictory. By weaving existing research into a cohesive narrative, we delve into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, spotlight potential research areas, and highlight inherent challenges. Moreover, we discuss how to estimate information-theoretic quantities and their associated empirical problems. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the intersection of information theory, self-supervised learning, and deep neural networks, aiming for a better understanding through our proposed unified approach.",

It is a tool and technology which can answer the question from your data. These programs are designed to learn and improve over time when exposed to new data. ML is a subset or a current application of AI. It is based on an idea that we should be able to give machines access to data and let them learn from themselves. ML deals with extraction of patterns from dataset, this means that machines can not only find the rules for optimal behavior but also can adapt to the changes in the world. Many of the algorithms involved have been known for decades. In this paper various algorithms of machine learning have been discussed. Machine learning algorithms are used for various purposes but we can say that once the machine learning algorithm studies how to manage data, it can do its work accordingly by itself.

        "abstract": "Representation Learning is a significant and challenging task in multimodal learning. Effective modality representations should contain two parts of characteristics: the consistency and the difference. Due to the unified multimodal annota- tion, existing methods are restricted in capturing differenti- ated information. However, additional unimodal annotations are high time- and labor-cost. In this paper, we design a la- bel generation module based on the self-supervised learning strategy to acquire independent unimodal supervisions. Then, joint training the multimodal and uni-modal tasks to learn the consistency and difference, respectively. Moreover, dur- ing the training stage, we design a weight-adjustment strat- egy to balance the learning progress among different sub- tasks. That is to guide the subtasks to focus on samples with the larger difference between modality supervisions. Last, we conduct extensive experiments on three public multimodal baseline datasets. The experimental results validate the re- liability and stability of auto-generated unimodal supervi- sions. On MOSI and MOSEI datasets, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods. On the SIMS dataset, our method achieves comparable performance than human- annotated unimodal labels. The full codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/Self-MM.",

        "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment and improved patient survival rates. While deep learning techniques have emerged as the leading approach for medical image analysis and processing, the most commonly employed supervised learning often requires large, high-quality annotated datasets that can be costly to obtain, particularly for pixel/voxel-wise image segmentation. To address this challenge and facilitate ICH treatment decisions, we introduce a novel weakly supervised method for ICH segmentation, utilizing a Swin transformer trained on an ICH classification task with categorical labels. Our approach leverages a hierarchical combination of head-wise gradient-infused self-attention maps to generate accurate image segmentation. Additionally, we conducted an exploratory study on different learning strategies and showed that binary ICH classification has a more positive impact on self-attention maps compared to full ICH subtyping. With a mean Dice score of 0.44, our technique achieved similar ICH segmentation performance as the popular U-Net and Swin-UNETR models with full supervision and outperformed a similar weakly supervised approach using GradCAM, demonstrating the excellent potential of the proposed framework in challenging medical image segmentation tasks.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nMachine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of gamma-ray astrophysics. The algorithms can distinguish between different source types, such as blazars and pulsars, and help uncover new insights into the high-energy universe. The Large Area Telescope onboard the Fermi gamma-ray telescope has significantly advanced our understanding of the Universe. The instrument has detected a large number of gamma-ray-emitting sources, among which a significant number of objects have been identified as active galactic nuclei. The sample is primarily composed of blazars; however, more than one-third of these sources are either of an unknown class or lack a definite association with a low-energy counterpart. In this work, we employ multiple machine learning algorithms to classify the sources based on their other physical properties. In particular, we utilized smart initialization techniques and self-supervised learning for classifying blazars into BL Lacertae (BL Lac, also BLL) objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). The core advantage of the algorithm is its simplicity, usage of minimum number of features and easy deployment due to lesser number of parameters without compromising on the performance along with increase in inference speed (at least seven times more than existing algorithms). As a result, the best-performing model is deployed on multiple platforms so that any user irrespective of their coding background can use the tool. The model predicts that out of the 1115 sources of uncertain type in the 4FGL-DR3 catalogue, 820 can be classified as BL Lacs and 295 can be classified as FSRQs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSeveral deep models were proposed in image processing, data interpretation, speech recognition, and video analysis. Most of these architectures need a massive proportion of training samples and use arbitrary configuration. This paper constructs a deep learning architecture with feature learning. Graph convolution networks (GCNs), semi-supervised learning and graph data representation, have become increasingly popular as cost-effective and efficient methods. Most existing merging node descriptions for node distribution on the graph use stabilised neighbourhood knowledge, typically requiring a significant amount of variables and a high degree of computational complexity. To address these concerns, this research presents DLM-SSC, a unique method semi-supervised node classification tasks that can combine knowledge from multiple neighbourhoods at the same time by integrating high-order convolution and feature learning. This paper employs two function learning techniques for reducing the number of parameters and hidden layers: modified marginal fisher analysis (MMFA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The MMFA and KPCA weight matrices are modified layer by layer when implementing the DLM, a supervised pretraining technique that doesn't require a lot of information. Free measuring on citation datasets (Citeseer, Pubmed, and Cora) and other data sets demonstrate that the suggested approaches outperform similar algorithms.",

Money is laundered through cryptocurrencies by distributing funds to multiple accounts and then reexchanging the crypto back. This process of exchanging currencies is done through cryptocurrency exchanges. Current preventive efforts are outdated, and ML may provide novel ways to identify illicit currency movements. Hence, this study investigates ML applicability for combatting money laundering activities using cryptocurrency.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nFour supervised-learning algorithms were compared using the Bitcoin Elliptic Dataset. The method covered a quantitative analysis of the algorithmic performance, capturing differences in three key evaluation metrics of F1-scores, precision and recall. Two complementary qualitative interviews were performed at cryptocurrency exchanges to identify fit and applicability of the algorithms.\n\n\nFindings\nThe study results show that the current implemented ML tools for preventing money laundering at cryptocurrency exchanges are all too slow and need to be optimized for the task. The results also show that while not one single algorithm is most suitable for detecting transactions related to money-laundering, the specific applicability of the decision tree algorithm is most suitable for adoption by cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nGiven the growth of cryptocurrency use, this study explores the newly developed field of algorithmic tools to combat illicit currency movement, in particular in the growing arena of cryptocurrencies. The study results provide new insights into the applicability of ML as a tool to combat money laundering using cryptocurrency exchanges.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractLung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths in many countries around the world, and its histopathological diagnosis is crucial for deciding on optimum treatment strategies. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning models have been widely shown to be useful in various medical fields, particularly image and pathological diagnoses; however, AI models for the pathological diagnosis of pulmonary lesions that have been validated on large-scale test sets are yet to be seen. We trained a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based on the EfficientNet-B3 architecture, using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning, to predict carcinoma in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a training dataset of 3,554 WSIs. We obtained highly promising results for differentiating between lung carcinoma and non-neoplastic with high Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) area under the curves (AUCs) on four independent test sets (ROC AUCs of 0.975, 0.974, 0.988, and 0.981, respectively). Development and validation of algorithms such as ours are important initial steps in the development of software suites that could be adopted in routine pathological practices and potentially help reduce the burden on pathologists.",

        "abstract": "Remote sensing data has been widely used for various Earth Observation (EO) missions such as land use and cover classification, weather forecasting, agricultural management, and environmental monitoring. Most existing remote-sensing-data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labeled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. The recent introduction of self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabeled data. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabeled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB color space, it may not be straightforward to extend to the multi/hyperspectral domain the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images. To address this challenge, this work proposed a generic self-supervised learning framework based on remote sensing data at both the object and pixel levels. The method contains two novel pretext tasks, one for object-based and one for pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods. One pretext task is used to reconstruct the spectral profile from the masked data, which can be used to extract a representation of pixel information and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with pixel-based analysis. The second pretext task is used to identify objects from multiple views of the same object in multispectral data, which can be used to extract a representation and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with object-based analysis. The results of two typical downstream task evaluation exercises (a multilabel land cover classification task on Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets) demonstrate that the proposed SSL method learns a target representation that covers both spatial and spectral information from massive unlabeled data. A comparison with currently available SSL methods shows that the proposed method, which emphasizes both spectral and spatial features, outperforms existing SSL methods on multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. We believe that this approach has the potential to be effective in a wider range of remote sensing applications and we will explore its utility in more remote sensing applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "\nInductive infrared thermography has been proven as an\ninteresting solution for the inspection of surface defects.\nTo automate the inspection, defect detection methods\nbased on convolutional neural network proved their\nefficiency for complex detection tasks compared to\ntraditional methods. Both supervised and semi-supervised\nlearning approaches have been proposed for the inspection\ntask. While the supervised approach remains the most\ncommon one, it requires images of both defective and\nnon-defective parts during the training phase.\nUnfortunately, in many industries where the scrap rate is\nlow, acquiring images of defective parts is difficult and\nrequires time which can delay the deployment of such\nsolutions. This paper compares these two learning\napproaches by illustrating the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each approach from an industrial point\nof view. In conclusion, we describe an inspection\ndeployment strategy, which combines the two approaches\nto ensure robust inspection with rapid deployment.\n",

        "abstract": "In this study, we approach a supervised learning algorithm to detect attacks in cloud computing. We categorize “Normal” and “Attack” statuses on the dataset. The model evaluation process uses the kappa statistic, the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision. The system has a very high detection and efficiency rate, with a detection rate of over 99%. A total of 9594 cases and 44 distinct columns are included in the dataset. The study's results were displayed using a ROC curve and a confusion matrix. This study focuses on implementing a supervised learning algorithm for detecting attacks in cloud computing environments. The main objective is distinguishing between \"Normal\" and \"Attack\" statuses based on a carefully curated dataset. Several metrics, such as the kappa statistic, F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision, are employed to evaluate the model's performance. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 9594 cases and encompasses 44 distinct columns, each representing specific features relevant to cloud computing security. Through a rigorous evaluation process, the algorithm demonstrates exceptional efficiency, achieving a remarkable detection rate of over 99%. Such high accuracy in identifying attacks is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of cloud-based systems. The significance of this study lies in its successful application of a supervised learning approach to tackle cloud computing security challenges effectively. The model's high detection rate and efficiency indicate its potential for real-world deployment in cloud-based systems, contributing to enhanced threat detection and mitigation. These results hold promising implications for bolstering the security measures of cloud computing platforms and safeguarding sensitive data and services from potential attacks.",

        "abstract": "Specific emitter identification (SEI) refers to distinguishing emitters using individual features extracted from wireless signals. The current SEI methods have proven to be accurate in tackling large labeled data sets at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, their performance declines dramatically in the presence of small samples and a significant noise environment. To address this issue, we propose a complex self-supervised learning scheme to fully exploit the unlabeled samples, comprised of a pretext task adopting the contrastive learning concept and a downstream task. In the former task, we design an optimized data augmentation method based on communication signals to serve the contrastive conception. Then, we embed a complex-valued network in the learning to improve the robustness to noise. The proposed scheme demonstrates the generality of handling the small and sufficient samples cases across a wide range from 10 to 400 being labeled in each group. The experiment also shows a promising accuracy and robustness where the recognition results increase at 10–16% from 10–15 SNR.",

        "abstract": "Separating audio mixtures into individual instrument tracks has been a standing challenge. We introduce a novel weakly supervised audio source separation approach based on deep adversarial learning. Specifically, our loss function adopts the Wasserstein distance which directly measures the distribution distance between the separated sources and the real sources for each individual source. Moreover, a global regularization term is added to fulfill the spectrum energy preservation property regardless separation. Unlike state-of-the-art weakly supervised models which often involve deliberately devised constraints or careful model selection, our approach need little prior model specification on the data, and can be straightforwardly learned in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed method performs competitively on public benchmark against state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.",

One of its applications is identity verification. After recording a dynamic facial motion video for enrollment, the user needs to show a matched facial appearance and make a facial motion the same as the enrollment for authentication. Some recent research papers have discussed the benefits of this new biometric technology and reported promising results for both static and dynamic facial motion verification tasks. Our work extends the existing approaches and introduces compound facial actions, which contain more than one dominant facial action in one utterance. We propose a new self-supervised pretraining method called contrastive subclips that improves the model performance with these more complex and secure facial motions. The experimental results show that the contrastive subclips method improves upon the baseline approaches, and the model performance for test data can reach 89.7% average precision.",

This article explores the performance of supervised machine learning classification methods for provenancing archaeological pottery through the use of freeware R code in the form of R Markdown files. An illustrative example was used to show all the steps of the new methodology, starting from the requirements to its implementation, the verification of its classification capability and finally, the production of cluster predictions. The example confirms that supervised methods are able to distinguish classes with similar features, and provenancing is achievable. The provided code contains self-explanatory notes to guide the users through the classification algorithms. Archaeometrists without previous knowledge of R should be able to apply the novel methodology to similar well-constrained classification problems. Experienced users could fully exploit the code to set up different combinations of parameters, and they could further develop it by adding other classification algorithms to suit the requirements of diverse classification strategies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical examination of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanisms. We begin by defining natural language space and knowledge space, which are two key concepts for understanding the dimensionality reduction process in GPT-based large language models (LLMs). By exploring projection functions and their inverses, we establish a framework for analyzing the language generation capabilities of these models. We then investigate the GPT representation space, examining its implications for the models’ approximation properties. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of GPT models and their learning mechanisms, considering trade-offs between complexity and generalization, as well as the implications of incomplete inverse projection functions. Our findings demonstrate that GPT models possess the capability to encode knowledge into low-dimensional vectors through their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanism. This comprehensive analysis provides a solid mathematical foundation for future advancements in GPT-based LLMs, promising advancements in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering due to improved understanding and optimization of model training and performance.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, deep learning has been increasingly used to decipher the relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function. Thus far these applications of deep learning have been mostly based on primary sequence information, while the vast amount of tertiary structure information remains untapped. In this study, we devised a self-supervised representation learning framework (PtsRep) to extract the fundamental features of unlabeled protein tertiary structures deposited in the PDB, a total of 35,568 structures. The learned embeddings were challenged with two commonly recognized protein engineering tasks: the prediction of protein stability and prediction of the fluorescence brightness of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants, with training datasets of 16,431 and 26,198 proteins or variants, respectively. On both tasks, PtsRep outperformed the two benchmark methods UniRep and TAPE-BERT, which were pre-trained on two much larger sets of data of 24 and 32 million protein sequences, respectively. Protein clustering analyses demonstrated that PtsRep can capture the structural signatures of proteins. Further testing of the GFP dataset revealed two important implications for protein engineering: (1) a reduced and experimentally manageable training dataset (20%, or 5,239 variants) yielded a satisfactory prediction performance for PtsRep, achieving a recall rate of 70% for the top 26 brightest variants with 795 variants in the testing dataset retrieved; (2) counter-intuitively, when only the bright variants were used for training, the performances of PtsRep and the benchmarks not only did not worsen but they actually slightly improved. This study provides a new avenue for learning and exploring general protein structural representations for protein engineering.",

        "abstract": "Whilst computer vision models built using self-supervised approaches are now commonplace, some important questions remain. Do self-supervised models learn highly redundant channel features? What if a self-supervised network could dynamically select the important channels and get rid of the unnecessary ones? Currently, convnets pre-trained with self-supervision have obtained comparable performance on downstream tasks in comparison to their supervised counterparts in computer vision. However, there are drawbacks to self-supervised models including their large numbers of parameters, computationally expensive training strategies and a clear need for faster inference on downstream tasks. In this work, our goal is to address the latter by studying how a standard channel selection method developed for supervised learning can be applied to networks trained with self-supervision. We validate our findings on a range of target budgets td for channel computation on image classification task across different datasets, specifically CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100, obtaining comparable performance to that of the original network when selecting all channels but at a significant reduction in computation reported in terms of FLOPs.",

        "abstract": "Due to the large growth in the number of cars being bought and sold, used-car price prediction creates a lot of interest in analysis and research. The availability of used cars in developing countries results in an increased choice of used vehicles, and people increasingly choose used vehicles over new ones, which causes shortages. There is an important need to explore the enormous amount of valuable data generated by vehicle sellers. All sellers usually have the imminent need of finding a better way to predict the future behavior of prices, which helps in determining the best time to buy or sell, in order to achieve the best profit. This paper provides an overview of data-driven models for estimating the price of used vehicles in the Croatian market using correlated attributes, in terms of production year and kilometers traveled. In order to achieve this, the technique of data mining from the online seller “Njuškalo” was used. Redundant and missing values were removed from the data set during data processing. Using the method of supervised machine learning, with the use of a linear regression algorithm for predicting the prices of used cars and comparing the accuracy with the classification algorithm, the purpose of this paper is to describe the state of the vehicle market and predict price trends based on available attributes. Prediction accuracy increases with training the model with the second data set, where price growth is predicted by linear regression with a prediction accuracy of 95%. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed model predicts increases in vehicle prices and decreases in the value of vehicles regarding kilometers traveled, regardless of the year of production. The average value of the first data set is a personal vehicle with 130,000 km traveled and a price of EUR 10,000. The second set of data was extracted 3 months after the previously analyzed set, and the average price of used vehicles increased by EUR 1391 per vehicle. On the other hand, average kilometers traveled decreased by 8060 km, which justifies the increase in prices and validates the training models. The price and vehicle type are features that play an important role in predicting the price in a second-hand market, which seems to be given less importance in the current literature of prediction models.",

Analyzing condition monitoring data, implementing diagnostic techniques and using machinery prognostic algorithms will bring about accurate estimation of the remaining life and possible failures that may occur. This paper proposes a combination of two supervised machine learning techniques; namely, the regression model and multilayer artificial neural network model, to predict the remaining useful life of rolling element bearings. Root mean square and Kurtosis were analyzed to define the bearing failure stages. The proposed methodology was validated through two case studies involving vibration measurements of an operational wind turbine gearbox and a split cylindrical roller bearing in a test rig.",

        "abstract": "Multireference (MR) diagnostics are common tools for identifying strongly correlated electronic structure that makes single reference (SR) methods (e.g., density functional theory or DFT) insufficient for accurate property prediction. However, MR diagnostics typically require computationally demanding correlated wavefunction theory (WFT) calculations, and diagnostics often disagree or fail to predict MR effects on properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a semi-supervised machine learning (ML) approach with virtual adversarial training (VAT) of an MR classifier using 15 WFT and DFT MR diagnostics as inputs. In semi-supervised learning, only the most extreme SR or MR points are labeled, and the remaining point labels are learned. The resulting VAT model outperforms the alternatives, as quantified by the distinct property distributions of SR- and MR-classified molecules. To reduce the cost of generating inputs to the VAT model, we leverage the VAT model’s robustness to noisy inputs by replacing WFT MR diagnostics with regression predictions in a MR decision engine workflow that preserves excellent performance. We demonstrate the transferability of our approach to larger molecules and those with distinct chemical composition from the training set. This MR decision engine demonstrates promise as a low-cost, high-accuracy approach to the automatic detection of strong correlation for predictive high-throughput screening.",

        "abstract": "Recently, self-supervised learning methods have been shown to be very powerful and efficient for yielding robust representation learning by maximizing the similarity across different augmented views in embedding vector space. However, the main challenge is generating different views with random cropping; the semantic feature might exist differently across different views leading to inappropriately maximizing similarity objective. We tackle this problem by introducing Heuristic Attention Representation Learning (HARL). This self-supervised framework relies on the joint embedding architecture in which the two neural networks are trained to produce similar embedding for different augmented views of the same image. HARL framework adopts prior visual object-level attention by generating a heuristic mask proposal for each training image and maximizes the abstract object-level embedding on vector space instead of whole image representation from previous works. As a result, HARL extracts the quality semantic representation from each training sample and outperforms existing self-supervised baselines on several downstream tasks. In addition, we provide efficient techniques based on conventional computer vision and deep learning methods for generating heuristic mask proposals on natural image datasets. Our HARL achieves +1.3% advancement in the ImageNet semi-supervised learning benchmark and +0.9% improvement in AP50 of the COCO object detection task over the previous state-of-the-art method BYOL. Our code implementation is available for both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.",

The main challenges are the scarcity of available labeled corpus and the identification of complexity semantic relations in text of Chinese EMRs. A hybrid method based on semi-supervised learning is proposed to extract the medical entity relations from small-scale complex Chinese EMRs. Methods: The semantic features of sentences are extracted by a residual network(ResNet) and the long dependent information is captured by bidirectional GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit). Then the attention mechanism is used to assign weights for the extracted features respectively, and the output of two attention mechanisms is integrated for relation prediction. We adjusted the training process with manually annotated small-scale relational corpus and bootstrapping semi-supervised learning algorithm, and continuously expanded the datasets during the training process. Results: We constructed a small corpus of Chinese EMRs relation extraction based on the EMR datasets released at the CCKS(China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing). The experimental results show that the best F1-score of the proposed method on the overall relation categories reaches 89.78%, which is 13.07% higher than the baseline CNN.",

        "abstract": "AbstractEcho planar imaging (EPI) is the most common approach for acquiring diffusion and functional MRI data due to its high temporal resolution. However, this comes at the cost of higher sensitivity to susceptibility-induced B0 field inhomogeneities around air/tissue inter-faces. This leads to severe geometric distortions along the phase encoding direction (PED). To correct this distortion, the standard approach involves an analogous acquisition using an opposite PED leading to images with inverted distortions and then non-linear image registration, with a transformation model constrained along the PED, to estimate the voxelwise shift that undistorts the image pair and generates a distortion-free image. With conventional image registration approaches, this type of processing is computationally intensive. Recent advances in unsupervised deep learning-based approaches to image registration have been proposed to drastically reduce the computational cost of this task. However, they rely on maximizing an intensity-based similarity measure, known to be suboptimal surrogate measures of image alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm that directly leverages ground truth spatial transformations during training. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrate improvement to distortion field recovery compared to the unsupervised approach, improvement image similarity compared to supervised approach and precision similar to TOPUP but with much faster processing.",

Unfortunately, many people in modern society are unable to differentiate these false narratives from real events. Utilizing natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and various other computer science techniques, models can be generated to help users immediately detect bias and falsehoods in political media. The models created in this experiment were able to detect up to 70% accuracy on political bias and 73% accuracy on falsehoods by utilizing datasets from a variety of collections of both political media and other mediums of information.

In recent years, each diagnostic classification model (DCM) makes different assumptions about the relationship between a student's response pattern and attribute profile. The previous research studies showed that the inappropriate DCMs and inaccurate Q-matrix impact diagnostic classification accuracy. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been proposed as a promising approach to convert a pattern of item responses into a diagnostic classification in some research studies. However, the ANNs methods produced very unstable and unappreciated estimation unless a great deal of care was taken. In this research, we combined ANNs with two typical DCMs, the deterministic-input, noisy, “and” gate (DINA) model and the deterministic-inputs, noisy, “or” gate (DINO) model, within a semi-supervised learning framework to achieve a robust and accurate classification. In both simulated study and real data study, the experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve appreciated performance across different test conditions, especially when the diagnostic quality of assessment was not high and the Q-matrix contained misspecified elements. This research study is the first time of applying the thinking of semi-supervised learning into CDM. Also, we used the validating test to choose the appropriate parameters for the ANNs instead of using typical statistical criteria.",

For atmospheric dynamics, however, it has so far not been considered, arguably due to the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets that could be used for training. In this work, we show how to sidestep the difficulty and introduce a self-supervised learning task that is applicable to a wide variety of unlabeled atmospheric datasets. Specifically, we train a neural network on the simple yet intricate task of predicting the temporal distance between atmospheric fields from distinct but nearby times. We demonstrate that training with this task on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset leads to internal representations that capture intrinsic aspects of atmospheric dynamics. For example, when employed as a loss function in other machine-learning applications, the derived AtmoDist distance leads to improved results compared to the \n\n\n$ {\\mathrm{\\ell}}_2 $\n\n-loss. For downscaling one obtains higher resolution fields that match the true statistics more closely than previous approaches and for the interpolation of missing or occluded data the AtmoDist distance leads to results that contain more realistic fine-scale features. Since it is obtained from observational data, AtmoDist also provides a novel perspective on atmospheric predictability.",

Developing a data-driven pipeline failure assessment model, however, faces a major challenge; failure history, in the form of incident reports, suffers from limited and missing information, making it difficult to incorporate a persistent input configuration to a supervised machine learning model. The literature falls short on the development of appropriate solutions to utilize incomplete databases and incident reports in the pipeline failure problem. This work proposes a semi-supervised machine learning framework which mines existing oil and gas pipeline failure databases. The proposed cluster-impute-classify (CIC) approach maps a relevant subset of the failure databases through which missing information in the incident report is reconstructed. A classifier is then trained on the fly to learn the functional relationship between the descriptors from a diverse feature set. The proposed approach, presented within an ensemble learning architecture, is easily scalable to various pipeline failure databases. The results show up to 91% detection accuracy and stable generalization ability against increased rate of missing information.",

It is common for people in their old age to have one form of disease or another depending on the circumstances in which they find themselves. This study analyzed and evaluated various supervised machine learning models to detect the presence of Parkinson&#039;s disease in elderly individuals. An extreme gradient boosting model, along with other models, such as naïve Bayes, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine (SVM), was implemented to determine the best outcome. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is a powerful boosting machine learning technique, particularly in terms of speed and accuracy. The results showed that the XGBoost model, which is an optimized version of the other boosting models, is capable of projecting the presence of Parkinson&#039;s disease with very high accuracy compared to other algorithms. The implemented classification algorithm extreme gradient boosting method achieved approximately 98 % accuracy, 97.5 % precision, 100.0 % recall, and 98.7% f1-score which are high compared with the results found in the existing literature.",

We use observations from ESA's Cluster mission to compile a database of events: Four thousand two hundred and sixteen events are identified in January–April 2007, and 5,194 in January–April 2008. Localized time scale images depicting angular changes are created for each event, and a preliminary classification algorithm is designed to distinguish between: simple—isolated events, and complex—multiple overlapping events. In 2007, 1,806 events are preclassified as simple, and 2,410 as complex; in 2008, 1,997 events are simple, and 3,197 are complex. A supervised machine learning approach is used to recognize and predict these events. Two models are trained: one for 2007, which is used to predict the results in 2008, and vice versa for 2008. To validate our results, we investigate the discontinuity occurrence rate as a function of spacecraft location. When the spacecraft is in the solar wind, we find an occurrence rate of ∼2 DDs per hour and a 50/50% ratio of simple/complex events. When the spacecraft is in the Earth's magnetosheath, we find that the total occurrence rate remains around 2 DDs/hr, but the ratio of simple/complex events changes to ∼25/75%. This implies that about half of the simple events observed in the solar wind are classified as complex when observed in the magnetosheath. This demonstrates that our classification scheme can provide meaningful insights, and thus be relevant for future studies on interplanetary discontinuities.",

Data-driven deep learning methods have recently become a prevailing approach for bearing fault detection.

Unlabeled data, on the other hand, are inexpensive. To fully utilize a large amount of unlabeled data together with limited labeled data to enhance fault detection performance, in this research, we develop a semi-supervised learning method built upon the autoencoder. In this method, a joint loss is established to account for the effects of both the labeled and unlabeled data, which is subsequently used to direct the backpropagation training. Systematic case studies using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) rolling bearing dataset are carried out, in which the effectiveness of this new method is verified by comparing it with other benchmark models.",

Current analytical solutions have limited applicability for complex flow regimes affected by casing motion, pipe rotation, eccentricity and cuttings. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop data-driven statistical learning models which can be very effective in making pressure loss predictions for given operating conditions. The data for proposed supervised learning was obtained from large scale experiments conducted on a narrow annulus wellbore configuration on LPAT (Low Pressure Ambient Temperature) flow loop at TUDRP, Tulsa University Research Projects Group. Exploratory visualizations were used to determine the relationship between operational parameters and pressure drop. Resampling methods, such as cross-validation and bootstrapping, were used to split the dataset into training and test data. Shrinkage and Decomposition technique was applied to make multivariate regression more robust. Comparison was made between different algorithms to determine the best model in terms of Least Mean-Squared-Error (MSE) on test data prediction and interpretability. Multivariate exploratory plots were used for data inference. Relationships between different factors and annular pressure drop were mostly linear. As expected, pressure drop increased with increase in flow-rate, inclination angle, ROP and for non-Newtonian polymeric fluids. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the data set. Approximately 98% of variance in data was explained by 5 principal components and the resulting model produced a MSE less than 1% of median pressure drop. Even though PCA regression model performed well on test data, final model was more difficult to interpret because it does not perform feature selection or even produce coefficient estimates. Therefore, Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used which gives better model interpretability as it is supervised by feature-outcome relationship. Shrinkage methods-Lasso and Ridge Regression were also used. These methods add an additional penalty term to Least Square Regression to get a bias-variance tradeoff. Cross-validation was used to select the penalty term that gave the lowest MSE. Both methods produced competitive MSE but performed better than PCA and PLS regression. In conclusion, Lasso-Regression performed the best with lowest error and good interpretability.",

In this study, we propose an innovative approach for detecting fake news by combining the power of RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art language model, with the Firefly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our model leverages RoBERTa’s contextual understanding of text to extract informative features from news articles, including content, user engagement, and source characteristics. The FOA is employed to optimize the selection of these features, enhancing the model’s ability to discern between genuine and deceptive news. The selected features are then used as inputs to an LSTM network, which learns the temporal dependencies within the data for accurate classification. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments using benchmark datasets such as ISOT and fakenewsnet specifically designed for fake news detection tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and other performance metrics. By integrating RoBERTa, FOA, and LSTM, our model effectively combines contextual understanding, feature selection optimization, and sequence modeling, enabling accurate identification of fake news articles. This research contributes to the advancement of fake news detection techniques and offers a promising solution to address the challenges associated with online misinformation, ultimately fostering trust and reliability in the digital information landscape.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDiffraction wavefield contains valuable information on subsurface composition through velocity extraction and sometimes anisotropy estimation. It can also be used for the delineation of geological features, such as faults, fractures and mineral deposits. Diffraction recognition is, therefore, crucial for improved interpretation of seismic data. To date, many workflows for diffraction denoising, including deep‐learning applications, have been provided, however, with a major focus on sedimentary settings or for ground‐penetrating radar data. In this study, we have developed a workflow for a self‐supervised learning technique, an autoencoder, for diffraction denoising on synthetic seismic, ground‐penetrating radar and hardrock seismic datasets. The autoencoder provides promising results especially for the ground‐penetrating radar data. Depending on the target of the studies, diffraction signals can be tackled using the autoencoder both as the signal and/or noise when, for example, a reflection is a target. The real hardrock seismic data required additional pre‐ and post‐autoencoder image processing steps to improve automatic delineation of the diffraction. Here, we also coupled the autoencoder with Hough transform and pixel edge detection filters. Along inlines and crosslines, diffraction signals have sometimes a similar character as the reflection and may spatially be correlated making the denoising workflow unsuccessful. Coupled with additional image processing steps, we successfully isolated diffraction that is generated from a known volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit. These encouraging results suggest that the self‐supervised learning techniques such as the autoencoder can be used also for seismic mineral exploration purposes and are worthy to be implemented as additional tools for data processing and target detections.",

We show that the DQC1 model can be leveraged to develop an efficient method for estimating complex kernel functions. We demonstrate a simple relationship between coherence consumption and the kernel function, a crucial element in machine learning. The paper presents an implementation of a binary classification problem on IBM hardware using the DQC1 model and analyzes the impact of quantum coherence and hardware noise. The advantage of our proposal lies in its utilization of quantum discord, which is more resilient to noise than entanglement.",

        "abstract": "Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is an important task in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that measures the similarity of the underlying semantics of two texts. Although pre-trained contextual embedding models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, BERT-derived sentence embeddings have been proven to collapse in some way, i.e., sentence embeddings generated by BERT depend on the frequency of words. Therefore, almost all BERT-derived sentence embeddings are mapped into a small area and have a high cosine similarity. Hence, sentence embeddings generated by BERT are not so robust in the STS task as they cannot capture the full semantic meaning of the sentences. In this paper, we propose SupMPN: A Supervised Multiple Positives and Negatives Contrastive Learning Model, which accepts multiple hard-positive sentences and multiple hard-negative sentences simultaneously and then tries to bring hard-positive sentences closer, while pushing hard-negative sentences away from them. In other words, SupMPN brings similar sentences closer together in the representation space by discrimination among multiple similar and dissimilar sentences. In this way, SupMPN can learn the semantic meanings of sentences by contrasting among multiple similar and dissimilar sentences and can generate sentence embeddings based on the semantic meaning instead of the frequency of the words. We evaluate our model on standard STS and transfer-learning tasks. The results reveal that SupMPN outperforms state-of-the-art SimCSE and all other previous supervised and unsupervised models.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPredicting potential links in heterogeneous biomedical networks (HBNs) can greatly benefit various important biomedical problem. However, the self-supervised representation learning for link prediction in HBNs has been slightly explored in previous researches. Therefore, this study proposes a two-level self-supervised representation learning, namely selfRL, for link prediction in heterogeneous biomedical networks. The meta path detection-based self-supervised learning task is proposed to learn representation vectors that can capture the global-level structure and semantic feature in HBNs. The vertex entity mask-based self-supervised learning mechanism is designed to enhance local association of vertices. Finally, the representations from two tasks are concatenated to generate high-quality representation vectors. The results of link prediction on six datasets show selfRL outperforms 25 state-of-the-art methods. In particular, selfRL reveals great performance with results close to 1 in terms of AUC and AUPR on the NeoDTI-net dataset. In addition, the PubMed publications demonstrate that nine out of ten drugs screened by selfRL can inhibit the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In summary, selfRL provides a general frame-work that develops self-supervised learning tasks with unlabeled data to obtain promising representations for improving link prediction.",

        "abstract": "Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for processing network structured data, and most graph representation learning methods rely heavily on labeling information for downstream tasks. Since labeled information is rare in the real world, adopting self-supervised learning to solve the graph neural network problem is a significant challenge. Currently, existing graph neural network approaches attempt to maximize mutual information for self-supervised learning, which leads to a large amount of redundant information in the graph representation and thus affects the performance of downstream tasks. Therefore, the self-supervised graph information bottleneck (SGIB) proposed in this paper uses the symmetry and asymmetry of graphs to establish comparative learning and introduces the information bottleneck theory as a loss training model. This model extracts the common features of both views and the independent features of each view by maximizing the mutual information estimation between the local high-level representation of one view and the global summary vector of the other view. It also removes redundant information not relevant to the target task by minimizing the mutual information between the local high-level representations of the two views. Based on the extensive experimental results of three public datasets and two large-scale datasets, it has been shown that the SGIB model can learn higher quality node representations and that several classical network analysis experiments such as node classification and node clustering can be improved compared to existing models in an unsupervised environment. In addition, an in-depth network experiment is designed for in-depth analysis, and the results show that the SGIB model can also alleviate the over-smoothing problem to a certain extent. Therefore, we can infer from different network analysis experiments that it would be an effective improvement of the performance of downstream tasks through introducing information bottleneck theory to remove redundant information.",

The extraction of picture characteristics in early efforts on fine-grained image classification relied on dense annotations, but acquiring these annotations was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Lately, weakly supervised fine-grained image classification has gradually emerged, which can mainly be separated between techniques using the attention mechanism and techniques using various neural networks. In this paper, focusing on the above two types of frameworks, we first introduce representative algorithms, including their innovation, basic processes, advantages and disadvantages. We then quantitatively compare the results of different algorithms on mainstream datasets, where the attention based methods can achieve excellent accuracy. We finally discuss the existing challenges and future development of the fine-grained classification task, which we believe can provide some new insight for this task.",

In this paper, we explore novel self-supervised learning techniques tailored specifically for image reconstruction tasks. We propose approaches that exploit the inherent relationships between low and high-resolution images, utilize context-aware information for inpainting, and incorporate generative adversarial networks for denoising.

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has received increasing attention in object detection field, because it only requires image-level annotations to indicate the presence or absence of target objects, which greatly reduces the labeling costs. Existing methods usually focus on the current individual image to learn object instance representations, while ignoring instance correlations between different images. To address this problem, we propose an instance-level contrastive learning (ICL) framework to mine reliable instance representations from all learned images, and use the contrastive loss to guide instance representation learning for the current image. Due to the diversity of instances, with different appearances, sizes or shapes, we propose an instance-diverse memory updating (IMU) algorithm to mine different instance representations and store them in a memory bank with multiple representation vectors per class, which also considers background information to enhance foreground representations. With the help of memory bank, we further propose a memory-aware instance mining (MIM) algorithm that combines proposal confidence and instance similarity across images to mine more reliable object instances. In addition, we also propose a memory-aware proposal sampling (MPS) algorithm to sample more positive proposals and remove some negative proposals to balance the learning of positive-negative samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC2007 and VOC2012 datasets, which are widely used in WSOD, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to our baseline, our method brings 14.2% mAP and 13.4% CorLoc gains on PASCAL VOC2007 dataset, and 12.2% mAP and 8.3% CorLoc gains on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset.",

        "abstract": "      Twitter popularity has increasingly grown in the last few years, influencing life’s social, political, and business aspects. People would leave their tweets on social media about an event, and simultaneously inquire to see other people's experiences and whether they had a positive/negative opinion about that event. Sentiment Analysis can be used to obtain this categorization. Product reviews, events, and other topics from all users that comprise unstructured text comments are gathered and categorized as good, harmful, or neutral using sentiment analysis. Such issues are called polarity classifications. This study aims to use Twitter data about OK cuisine reviews obtained from the Amazon website and compare the effectiveness of three commonly used supervised learning classifiers, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. This is achieved by using two method of feature selection involving count Vectorizer and Term-Frequency-Inverse Data Frequency. The findings showed that the support vector machine classifier had achieved the highest accuracy of 91%, by feature selection: Count Vectorizer. But it is time consuming. For both accuracy and execution time concentrates, logistic regression is recommended.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAs an essential process in subsurface interpretation, seismic‐well tie aims at calibrating the well measurements in depth domain with the seismic records in time domain for reliable reservoir mapping and modelling. Such a process usually requires massive manual efforts, primarily extracting source wavelets to synthesize seismograms from well measurements and stretching/squeezing synthetic seismograms to match actual seismic signals, and thus becomes time‐consuming and labour intensive with the amount of wells expanding in a field. This paper formulates the seismic‐well tie problem from the perspective of computer vision and, considering the lack of manually prepared training labels in most of real projects, proposes automating it by a self‐supervised workflow of two key components. The first component is to extract time‐variant wavelets in the target interval using a dual‐task autoencoder, which is optimized by maximizing the spectrum similarity between the extracted wavelet and the actual seismic. The second component is to estimate the corresponding time‐shift between a pair of the synthetic seismogram and the actual seismic using a flow net, which is trained by a pseudo dataset derived from the actual well measurements. More specifically, the data generation consists with defining one‐dimensional time‐shift curves to warp the original less accurate time‐depth relationships and then synthesizing the corresponding seismograms based on the convolutional model at all available wells. When turning to the stage of inference at a target well, the proposed workflow automatically extracts a representative wavelet, generates the corresponding synthetic seismogram from the original time‐depth relationship and estimates the time‐shift curve necessary for revising the original time‐depth relationship that would lead to an optimal tying with the actual seismic at the well. The proposed workflow is tested on two field datasets, and both results demonstrate improved tying over traditional methods such as statistical wavelet extraction and dynamic time warping.",

However, their practical application is limited by the lack of methods for measuring many polarizations in a scalable and compact way.

We map the beam polarization content into a spatial intensity distribution through light scattering and exploit supervised learning for single-shot measurements of multiple polarizations. We characterize structured light encoding up to nine polarizations with accuracy beyond 95% on each Stokes parameter. The method also allows us to classify beams with an unknown number of polarization modes, a functionality missing in conventional techniques. Our findings enable a fast and compact polarimeter for polarization-structured light, a general tool that may radically impact optical devices for sensing, imaging, and computing.",

Dimensionality reduction is essential for downstream analysis, such as clustering to identify cell subpopulations. Usually, dimensionality reduction follows unsupervised approach.\n\nResults\nIn this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method named scSemiAE, which is based on an autoencoder model. It transfers the information contained in available datasets with cell subpopulation labels to guide the search of better low-dimensional representations, which can ease further analysis.\n\nConclusions\nExperiments on five public datasets show that, scSemiAE outperforms both unsupervised and semi-supervised baselines whether the transferred information embodied in the number of labeled cells and labeled cell subpopulations is much or less.\n",

Together, such evidence points to a broad role for cerebellar circuits in generating and testing predictions about movement, reward, and other non-motor operations. However, this expanded view of cerebellar processing also raises many new questions about how such apparent diversity of function arises from a structure with striking homogeneity. Hence, this review will highlight both current evidence for predictive cerebellar circuit function that extends beyond the classical view of error-driven supervised learning, as well as open questions that must be addressed to unify our understanding cerebellar circuit function.",

        "abstract": "Using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models to diagnose cancer from histology data presents several challenges related to the nature and availability of labeled histology images, including image size, stain variations, and label ambiguity. In addition, cancer grading and the localization of regions of interest (ROIs) in such images normally rely on both image- and pixel-level labels, with the latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training of DL models. Given only image-class annotations, these methods can be trained to simultaneously classify an image, and yield class activation maps (CAMs) for ROI localization. This paper provides a review of deep WSOL methods to identify and locate diseases in histology images, without the need for pixel-level annotations. We propose a taxonomy in which these methods are divided into bottom-up and top-down methods according to the information flow in models. Although the latter have seen only limited progress, recent bottom-up methods are currently  driving a lot of progress with the use of deep WSOL methods. Early works focused on designing different spatial pooling functions. However, those methods quickly peaked in term of localization accuracy and revealed a major limitation, namely, – the under-activation of CAMs, which leads to high false negative localization. Subsequent works aimed to alleviate this shortcoming and recover the complete object from the background, using different techniques such as perturbation, self-attention, shallow features, pseudo-annotation, and task decoupling.<br>In the present paper, representative deep WSOL methods from our taxonomy are also evaluated and compared in terms of classification and localization accuracy using two challenging public histology datasets – one for colon cancer (GlaS), and a second, for breast cancer (CAMELYON16). Overall, the results indicate poor localization performance, particularly for generic methods that were initially designed to process natural images. Methods designed to address the challenges posed by histology data often use priors such as ROI size, or additional pixel-wise supervision estimated from a pre-trained classifier, allowing them to achieve better results. However, all the methods suffer from high false positive/negative localization. Classification performance is mainly affected by the model selection process, which uses either the classification or the localization metric. Finally, four key challenges are identified in the application of deep WSOL methods in histology, namely, – under-/over-activation of CAMs, sensitivity to thresholding, and model selection – and research avenues are provided to mitigate them.

The main goals of computational linguistics include: Text-to- speech conversion, Speech-to-text conversion and Translating from one language to another. A part of Computational Linguistics is the Character recognition. Character recognition has been one of the active and challenging research areas in the field of image processing and pattern recognition. Character recognition methodology mainly focuses on recognizing the characters irrespective of the difficulties that arises due to the variations in writing style. The aim of this project is to perform character recognition for of one of the complex structures of south Indian language ‘Tamil’ using a supervised algorithm that increases the accuracy of recognition. The novelty of this system is that it recognizes the characters of the Predominant Tamil Language. The proposed approach is capable of recognizing text where the traditional character recognition systems fails, notably in the presence of blur, low contrast, low resolution, high image noise, and other distortions. This system uses Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm that are able to exact the local features more accurately as they restrict the receptive fields of the hidden layers to be local. Convolutional Neural Networks are a great kind of multi-layer neural networks that uses back-propagation algorithm. Convolutional Neural Networks are used to recognize visual patterns directly from pixel images with minimal preprocessing. This trained network is used for recognition and classification. The results show that the proposed system yields good recognition rates.",

        "abstract": "Representation Learning is a significant and challenging task in multimodal learning. Effective modality representations should contain two parts of characteristics: the consistency and the difference. Due to the unified multimodal annota- tion, existing methods are restricted in capturing differenti- ated information. However, additional unimodal annotations are high time- and labor-cost. In this paper, we design a la- bel generation module based on the self-supervised learning strategy to acquire independent unimodal supervisions. Then, joint training the multimodal and uni-modal tasks to learn the consistency and difference, respectively. Moreover, dur- ing the training stage, we design a weight-adjustment strat- egy to balance the learning progress among different sub- tasks. That is to guide the subtasks to focus on samples with the larger difference between modality supervisions. Last, we conduct extensive experiments on three public multimodal baseline datasets. The experimental results validate the re- liability and stability of auto-generated unimodal supervi- sions. On MOSI and MOSEI datasets, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods. On the SIMS dataset, our method achieves comparable performance than human- annotated unimodal labels. The full codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/Self-MM.",

        "abstract": "Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient’s emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient’s emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patient’s emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

In this study, we developed a novel self-supervised pre-trained language model, SpliceBERT, to improve sequence-based RNA splicing prediction. Pre-training on pre-mRNA sequences from vertebrates enables SpliceBERT to capture evolutionary conservation information and characterize the unique property of splice sites. SpliceBERT also improves zero-shot prediction of variant effects on splicing by considering sequence context information, and achieves superior performance for predicting branchpoint in the human genome and splice sites across species. Our study highlighted the importance of pre-training genomic language models on a diverse range of species and suggested that pre-trained language models were promising for deciphering the sequence logic of RNA splicing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground： Malaria is still a serious life-threatening disease caused by plasmodium parasites. Microscopy is a widely used method for malaria diagnosis. However, it is relied heavily on the skills and experience of inspectors. There are many misdiagnoses in the areas with low medical level or few cases due to the lack of skilled inspectors.\nMethods： In recent years, CNN models has gained many successful applications in image classification. Unlike the objects in the ImageNet, the image of plasmodium only has a tiny defect area with a large amount of information. In addition, the dataset is extremely unbalanced in which the number of positive samples is much less than the number of negative samples. In this paper, we propose a classification network by combining attention mechanism and ResNeSt for plasmodium detection and use self-supervised learning to pre-train the network. First, the positive samples are used to pre-train the network. Then, attention modules are used to highlight feature area. To support current and future research, we also construct a plasmodium dataset with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malaria and non-Plasmodium.\nResults： The experiments show that our model obtains an excellent performance where the test accuracy, the sensitivity, and the specificity are 97.8%, 96.5%, 98.9%, respectively.\nConclusion： The AI classification method proposed in this paper can effectively assist clinicians in the diagnosis and provide a basis for the automatic detection of malaria parasites in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Manifold Learning (ML) has become essential in recent years for expression data visualization and dimension reduction. ML operates under the assumption that the data points lie on a manifold embedded in Euclidean space. The goal of ML is to learn an inverse embedding function to decipher the manifold structure. Cancer classification is a widely investigated application of expression profile data (e.g., miRNA) currently in the literature. The non-linear ML techniques commonly applied to expression data, such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (TSNE), Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), are intended for visualization, and cannot easily be applied to classification or unseen data, more generally. Such methods are also unsupervised, and do not factor in class information. Conventional linear ML methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), while applicable to unseen data and easy to use, are limited and can learn only linear manifolds.\nResults: We introduce a novel, non-linear ML technique, which incorporates class memberships, and is readily applicable to unseen data and classification. Specifically, we construct a series of neighborhood graphs which describe the manifold structure locally within each cluster and among the cluster centroids. Our objective function uses the neighborhood graph information to preserve the class separations and manifold structure in reduced dimension space, and we train a neural network to learn an explicit, inverse embedding function. This allows for fast visualization and classification of unseen data. The technique is compared against similar methods from the literature which use neural networks for ML, and is shown to offer improved cancer classification performance on expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA).\nConclusion: We present a new, supervised ML technique designed specifically for classification, which can be efficiently applied to unseen data. The results show promise on multiple, large-scale expression data sets, and thus warrant further research into supervised ML methods for cancer classification and expression data visualization.\nCitation Format: James Webber, Kevin Elias.

        "abstract": "Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient’s emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient’s emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues. Our proposed work will be helpful to automatically detect a patient’s emotion during disease and to avoid extreme acts like suicide, mental disorders, or psychological health issues.

        "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised learning which does not require a large number of manual labels generate supervised signals through the data itself to attain the characterization learning of samples. Self-supervised learning solves the problem of learning semantic features from unlabeled data, and realizes pre-training of models in large data sets. Its significant advantages have been extensively studied by scholars in recent years. There are usually three types of self-supervised learning: “Generative, Contrastive, and Generative-Contrastive.” The model of the comparative learning method is relatively simple, and the performance of the current downstream task is comparable to that of the supervised learning method. Therefore, we propose a conceptual analysis framework: data augmentation pipeline, architectures, pretext tasks, comparison methods, semi-supervised fine-tuning. Based on this conceptual framework, we qualitatively analyze the existing comparative self-supervised learning methods for computer vision, and then further analyze its performance at different stages, and finally summarize the research status of self-supervised comparative learning methods in other fields.",

Predicting RNA splicing from primary sequences can facilitate the interpretation of genomic variants. In this study, we developed a novel self-supervised pre-trained language model, SpliceBERT, to improve sequence-based RNA splicing prediction. Pre-training on pre-mRNA sequences from vertebrates enables SpliceBERT to capture evolutionary conservation information and characterize the unique property of splice sites. SpliceBERT also improves zero-shot prediction of variant effects on splicing by considering sequence context information, and achieves superior performance for predicting branchpoint in the human genome and splice sites across species. Our study highlighted the importance of pre-training genomic language models on a diverse range of species and suggested that pre-trained language models were promising for deciphering the sequence logic of RNA splicing.",

Recent observations on CT images of human lungs infected by COVID-19 is a challenging task for the researchers in finding suitable image patterns for automatic diagnosis. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised shallow learning network model comprising Parallel Quantum-Inspired Self-supervised Network (PQIS-Net) with Fully Connected (FC) layers is proposed for automatic segmentation followed by patch-based classifications on segmented lung CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. The PQIS-Net model is incorporated for fully automated segmentation of lung CT scan images obviating pre-trained convolutional neural network models for feature learning. The PQIS-Net model comprises a trinity of layered structures of quantum bits inter-connected through rotation gates using an 8-connected second-order neighborhood topology for the segmentation of wide variation of local intensities of the CT images. Intensive experiments have been carried out on two publicly available lung CT image data sets thereby achieving promising segmentation outcome and diagnosis efficiency (F1-score and AUC) while compared with the state of the art pre-trained convolutional based models.",

In such a situation, supervised machine learning techniques for classification appears as a suitable solution to model the value & veracity of data, especially in the Arabic language as a language used by millions of people around the world. To achieve this task, we had to collect data manually from SM platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Arabic news websites. This paper aims to classify Arabic language news into fake news and real news, by creating a Machine Learning (ML) model that will detect Arabic fake news (DAFN) about COVID-19 vaccination. To achieve our goal, we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which is especially challenging since NLP libraries support for Arabic is not common. We will use NLTK package of python to preprocess the data, and then we will use a ML model for the classification.",

However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model.4S-DTencourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images.4S-DThelps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data.4S-DTcan deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar.4S-DThas achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.44 %, 99.98%) in the detection of COVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97.54% (95% CI: 96.22%, 98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small dataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.",

The most significant advantage of the Wafer-Level Package (WLP) is that it can effectively reduce the volume and footprint area of the package. An important issue in the design of WLP is how to quickly and accurately predict the reliability life under the accelerated thermal cycling test (ATCT). If the simulation approach is not adopted, it usually takes several ACTCs to design a WLP, and each ACTC will take several months to get the reliability life results, which increases development time considerably. However, simulation results may differ depending on the designer’s domain knowledge, ability, and experience. This shortcoming can be overcome with artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, finite element analysis (FEA) is combined with machine learning algorithms, e.g., Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), to create an AI model for predicting the reliability life of electronic packaging. Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) combined with the K-means cluster algorithm provides a highly accurate and efficient way to obtain AI models for large-scale data sets.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMachine learning (ML) models have been widely successful in the prediction of material properties. However, large labeled datasets required for training accurate ML models are elusive and computationally expensive to generate. Recent advances in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) frameworks capable of training ML models on unlabeled data mitigate this problem and demonstrate superior performance in computer vision and natural language processing. Drawing inspiration from the developments in SSL, we introduce Crystal Twins (CT): a generic SSL method for crystalline materials property prediction that can leverage large unlabeled datasets. CT adapts a twin Graph Neural Network (GNN) and learns representations by forcing graph latent embeddings of augmented instances obtained from the same crystalline system to be similar. We implement Barlow Twins and SimSiam frameworks in CT. By sharing the pre-trained weights when fine-tuning the GNN for downstream tasks, we significantly improve the performance of GNN on 14 challenging material property prediction benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "<abstract><p>With the development of deep learning, medical image segmentation has become a promising technique for computer-aided medical diagnosis. However, the supervised training of the algorithm relies on a large amount of labeled data, and the private dataset bias generally exists in previous research, which seriously affects the algorithm's performance. In order to alleviate this problem and improve the robustness and generalization of the model, this paper proposes an end-to-end weakly supervised semantic segmentation network to learn and infer mappings. Firstly, an attention compensation mechanism (ACM) aggregating the class activation map (CAM) is designed to learn complementarily. Then the conditional random field (CRF) is introduced to prune the foreground and background regions. Finally, the obtained high-confidence regions are used as pseudo labels for the segmentation branch to train and optimize using a joint loss function. Our model achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) score of 62.84% in the segmentation task, which is an effective improvement of 11.18% compared to the previous network for segmenting dental diseases. Moreover, we further verify that our model has higher robustness to dataset bias by improved localization mechanism (CAM). The research shows that our proposed approach improves the accuracy and robustness of dental disease identification.</p></abstract>",

        "abstract": "In this study, we approach a supervised learning algorithm to detect attacks in cloud computing. We categorize “Normal” and “Attack” statuses on the dataset. The model evaluation process uses the kappa statistic, the F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision. The system has a very high detection and efficiency rate, with a detection rate of over 99%. A total of 9594 cases and 44 distinct columns are included in the dataset. The study's results were displayed using a ROC curve and a confusion matrix. This study focuses on implementing a supervised learning algorithm for detecting attacks in cloud computing environments. The main objective is distinguishing between \"Normal\" and \"Attack\" statuses based on a carefully curated dataset. Several metrics, such as the kappa statistic, F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision, are employed to evaluate the model's performance. The dataset utilized in this research comprises 9594 cases and encompasses 44 distinct columns, each representing specific features relevant to cloud computing security. Through a rigorous evaluation process, the algorithm demonstrates exceptional efficiency, achieving a remarkable detection rate of over 99%. Such high accuracy in identifying attacks is crucial for ensuring the integrity and security of cloud-based systems. The significance of this study lies in its successful application of a supervised learning approach to tackle cloud computing security challenges effectively. The model's high detection rate and efficiency indicate its potential for real-world deployment in cloud-based systems, contributing to enhanced threat detection and mitigation. These results hold promising implications for bolstering the security measures of cloud computing platforms and safeguarding sensitive data and services from potential attacks.",

        "abstract": "Separating audio mixtures into individual instrument tracks has been a standing challenge. We introduce a novel weakly supervised audio source separation approach based on deep adversarial learning. Specifically, our loss function adopts the Wasserstein distance which directly measures the distribution distance between the separated sources and the real sources for each individual source. Moreover, a global regularization term is added to fulfill the spectrum energy preservation property regardless separation. Unlike state-of-the-art weakly supervised models which often involve deliberately devised constraints or careful model selection, our approach need little prior model specification on the data, and can be straightforwardly learned in an end-to-end fashion. We show that the proposed method performs competitively on public benchmark against state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.",

After recording a dynamic facial motion video for enrollment, the user needs to show a matched facial appearance and make a facial motion the same as the enrollment for authentication. Some recent research papers have discussed the benefits of this new biometric technology and reported promising results for both static and dynamic facial motion verification tasks. Our work extends the existing approaches and introduces compound facial actions, which contain more than one dominant facial action in one utterance. We propose a new self-supervised pretraining method called contrastive subclips that improves the model performance with these more complex and secure facial motions. The experimental results show that the contrastive subclips method improves upon the baseline approaches, and the model performance for test data can reach 89.7% average precision.",

In this study, we proposed and validated a domain adaptive land cover classification model, to automatically classify Google Earth images into pixel-based land cover maps. By combining the domain adaptation and self-supervised learning technique, we extend the model’s generalization ability even trained with a small dataset. Furthermore, we explored the impact of land surface composition on the local meteorological parameters and air pollutant concentrations. Urban surface information was extracted around weather stations and air quality monitoring stations from three most developed urban agglomerations in China, including Beijing, Shanghai and the great bay area (GBA). Correlation analysis results show that air temperature has a strong positive correlation with neighbor artificial impervious surface fraction, with Pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0.6 in all areas except for the spring in the GBA. The correlation is much weaker and variant for air pollutants. This work provides an efficient method for urban land cover extraction which will be of great value for assessing the urban surface composition, quantifying the impact of land use/land cover, and facilitating the development of informed policies.",

        "abstract": "A little over a year after the official announcement from the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic consequences globally. Today, millions of doses of vaccines have already been administered in several countries. However, the positive effect of these vaccines will probably be seen later than expected. In these circumstances, the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 still remains the only way to slow the spread of this virus. However, it is difficult to predict whether a person is infected or not by COVID-19 while relying only on apparent symptoms. In this context, we propose to use machine learning (ML) algorithms in order to diagnose COVID-19 infected patients more effectively. The proposed diagnosis method takes into consideration several symptoms, such as flu symptoms, throat pain, immunity status, diarrhea, voice type, body temperature, joint pain, dry cough, vomiting, breathing problems, headache, and chest pain. Based on these symptoms that are modelled as ML features, our proposed method is able to predict the probability of contamination with the COVID-19 virus. This method is evaluated using different experimental analysis metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The obtained experimental results have shown that the proposed method can predict the presence of COVID-19 with over 97% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Specific emitter identification (SEI) refers to distinguishing emitters using individual features extracted from wireless signals. The current SEI methods have proven to be accurate in tackling large labeled data sets at a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, their performance declines dramatically in the presence of small samples and a significant noise environment. To address this issue, we propose a complex self-supervised learning scheme to fully exploit the unlabeled samples, comprised of a pretext task adopting the contrastive learning concept and a downstream task. In the former task, we design an optimized data augmentation method based on communication signals to serve the contrastive conception. Then, we embed a complex-valued network in the learning to improve the robustness to noise. The proposed scheme demonstrates the generality of handling the small and sufficient samples cases across a wide range from 10 to 400 being labeled in each group. The experiment also shows a promising accuracy and robustness where the recognition results increase at 10–16% from 10–15 SNR.",

The example confirms that supervised methods are able to distinguish classes with similar features, and provenancing is achievable. The provided code contains self-explanatory notes to guide the users through the classification algorithms. Archaeometrists without previous knowledge of R should be able to apply the novel methodology to similar well-constrained classification problems.

We begin by defining natural language space and knowledge space, which are two key concepts for understanding the dimensionality reduction process in GPT-based large language models (LLMs). By exploring projection functions and their inverses, we establish a framework for analyzing the language generation capabilities of these models. We then investigate the GPT representation space, examining its implications for the models’ approximation properties. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of GPT models and their learning mechanisms, considering trade-offs between complexity and generalization, as well as the implications of incomplete inverse projection functions. Our findings demonstrate that GPT models possess the capability to encode knowledge into low-dimensional vectors through their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanism. This comprehensive analysis provides a solid mathematical foundation for future advancements in GPT-based LLMs, promising advancements in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering due to improved understanding and optimization of model training and performance.",

The majority of the healthcare industry still uses labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone traditional, manual, and manpower-based methods. This review addresses the current paradigm, the potential for new scientific discoveries, the technological state of preparation, the potential for supervised machine learning (SML) prospects in various healthcare sectors, and ethical issues. The effectiveness and potential for innovation of disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, clinical trials, non-invasive image analysis, drug discovery, patient care services, remote patient monitoring, hospital data, and nanotechnology in various learning-based automation in healthcare along with the requirement for explainable artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare are evaluated. In order to understand the potential architecture of non-invasive treatment, a thorough study of medical imaging analysis from a technical point of view is presented. This study also represents new thinking and developments that will push the boundaries and increase the opportunity for healthcare through AI and SML in the near future. Nowadays, SML-based applications require a lot of data quality awareness as healthcare is data-heavy, and knowledge management is paramount. Nowadays, SML in biomedical and healthcare developments needs skills, quality data consciousness for data-intensive study, and a knowledge-centric health management system. As a result, the merits, demerits, and precautions need to take ethics and the other effects of AI and SML into consideration. The overall insight in this paper will help researchers in academia and industry to understand and address the future research that needs to be discussed on SML in the healthcare and biomedical sectors.",

The SOR process gives rise to the instability (fingering) phenomena due to the injecting force and the difference in the wettability and viscosity of the oil and water at the common interface. Since the late 1800s, mathematical models of petroleum reservoirs have been extensively used in the oil and gas industry. In this paper, we investigated the saturation of two immiscible fluid (oil and water) flows through homogeneous porous media during the SOR process by solving the modeled partial differential equation using the supervised machine learning algorithm based on feedforward back-propagated neural networks (FFBNNs) and Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm. The designed scientific computing technique (FFBNN-LMA) is further employed to study the detailed sensitivity analysis of the approximate solutions.

        "abstract": "AbstractIdentifying the entirety of gene regulatory interactions in a biological system offers the possibility to determine the key molecular factors that affect important traits on the level of cells, tissues, and whole organisms. Despite the development of experimental approaches and technologies for identification of direct binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoter regions of downstream target genes, computational approaches that utilize large compendia of transcriptomics data are still the predominant methods used to predict direct downstream targets of TFs, and thus reconstruct genome‐wide gene‐regulatory networks (GRNs). These approaches can broadly be categorized into unsupervised and supervised, based on whether data about known, experimentally verified gene‐regulatory interactions are used in the process of reconstructing the underlying GRN. Here, we first describe the generic steps of supervised approaches for GRN reconstruction, since they have been recently shown to result in improved accuracy of the resulting networks? We also illustrate how they can be used with data from model organisms to obtain more accurate prediction of gene regulatory interactions. © 2020 The Authors.Basic Protocol 1: Construction of features used in supervised learning of gene regulatory interactionsBasic Protocol 2: Learning the non‐interacting TF‐gene pairsBasic Protocol 3: Learning a classifier for gene regulatory interactions",

        "abstract": "Marine coastal ecosystems offer numerous ecosystem services and are therefore subject to a variety of stressors from anthropogenic activities. Environmental biomonitoring programs for effective management and conservation of coastal marine ecosystems are therefore crucial. Traditional monitoring has been based on macrofauna indices which are laborious and require expert knowledge. Recently, eDNA metabarcoding has become increasingly popular as it does not involve macrofauna species identification and is therefore cost and time inexpensive. Studies have shown that ecosystem monitoring based on eDNA metabarcoding is feasible and random forest (RF) algorithms can predict various biological indices, and therefore ecosystem health. To propose adequate designs for future eDNA metabarcoding-based marine coastal monitoring surveys, the aim of the study is to find out (1) What is the lower limit of reads for accurate RF predictions in coastal marine monitoring using microbial communities? (2) Is this limit the same for different monitoring targets? To achieve this goal, we exploited four different Illumina amplicon datasets obtained from bacterial communities in different costal environments. From these datasets, we predicted different objectives relevant for biomonitoring. For each dataset, those corresponding prediction objectives (labels) were predicted using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) as features. After construction of RF models using all available sequences of a dataset (full model, serving as benchmark for targeted prediction accuracy), we then successively down-sampled each dataset to lower sequence numbers. Prediction accuracies of the reduced models were then compared to the accuracies of the full models to assess the minimum number of features to obtain the targeted prediction accuracy. Our results show that there is no general answer to question (1) and that (2) the limit varies between different monitoring targets. We have identified the most informative criteria that are relevant to assess the sequencing depth required to predict a biomonitoring category using RF. This may guide future study designs and may help to estimate and control costs in applied routine DNA-based biomonitoring using RF to predict the biomonitoring target. In our contribution we will elucidate and discuss these criteria.",

        "abstract": "Canonical deep learning-based Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction relies on supervised learning methods which in turn requires large data sets of run-to-failure data to ensure model performance. In a large class of cases, run-to-failure data is difficult to collect in practice as it may be expensive and unsafe to operate assets until failure. As such, there is a need to leverage data that are not run-to-failure but may still contain some measurable, and thus learnable, degradation signal. In this paper, we propose utilizing self-supervised learning as a pretraining step to learn representations of the data which will enable efficient training on the downstream task of RUL prediction. The self-supervised learning task chosen is time series sequence ordering, a task that involves constructing tuples each consisting of $n$ sequences sampled from the time series and reordered with some probability $p$. Subsequently, a classifier is trained on the resulting binary classification task; distinguishing between correctly ordered and shuffled tuples. The classifier's weights are then transferred to the RUL-model and fine-tuned using run-to-failure data. We show that the proposed self-supervised learning scheme can retain performance when training on a fraction of the full data set. In addition, we show indications that self-supervised learning as a pretraining step can enhance the performance of the model even when training on the full run-to-failure data set. To conduct our experiments, we use a data set of simulated run-to-failure turbofan jet engines.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWe present improvements over our previous approach to automatic winter hydrometeor classification by means of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), using more data and improved training techniques to achieve higher accuracy on a more complicated dataset than we had previously demonstrated. As an advancement of our previous proof-of-concept study, this work demonstrates broader usefulness of deep CNNs by using a substantially larger and more diverse dataset, which we make publicly available, from many more snow events. We describe the collection, processing, and sorting of this dataset of over 25,000 high-quality multiple-angle snowflake camera (MASC) image chips split nearly evenly between five geometric classes: aggregate, columnar crystal, planar crystal, graupel, and small particle. Raw images were collected over 32 snowfall events between November 2014 and May 2016 near Greeley, Colorado and were processed with an automated cropping and normalization algorithm to yield 224x224 pixel images containing possible hydrometeors. From the bulk set of over 8,400,000 extracted images, a smaller dataset of 14,793 images was sorted by image quality and recognizability (Q&R) using manual inspection. A presorting network trained on the Q&R dataset was applied to all 8,400,000+ images to automatically collect a subset of 283,351 good snowflake images. Roughly 5,000 representative examples were then collected from this subset manually for each of the five geometric classes. With a higher emphasis on in-class variety than our previous work, the final dataset yields trained networks that better capture the imperfect cases and diverse forms that occur within the broad categories studied to achieve an accuracy of 96.2% on a vastly more challenging dataset.",

However, there is a lack of their applications in transition metal (TM) complexes due to their flexible coordination environment, multiple accessible oxidation and spin states, despite the importance of these complexes in fine chemical synthesis, commodity production, and optical applications. Herein, we propose a joint semi-supervised junction-tree variational autoencoder (SSVAE) and artificial neural network (ANN) classifier model, coined as LiveTransForM (Ligand variational auto-encoder and Transfer learning For transition Metal complexes), for the design of octahedral TM complexes. LiveTransForM allows the design of ligands that build up TM complexes and the prediction of the spin states of the assembled complexes. We show that the accuracy of the classifier is improved when the latent variables from the SSVAE are used as input for the ANN model compared to those from the unsupervised VAE. Input augmentation using the three molecular axes also improves the accuracy of the classifier. 58 complexes with predicted spin states are then generated by LiveTransForM and the accuracy of their spin state labels are validated by density functional theory methods. Two design strategies, single mutation and seeded generation, are also introduced to allow the directed evolution of parent complexes towards desirable spin states and local modification of seed complexes to generate complexes with similar spin states, respectively.",

First, a 3D convolutional network extracts feature vectors from video clips for encoding spatial and short-term temporal features. Second, the feature vectors are fed into a transformer network for capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Two main models are proposed, based on the backbone framework: C3DTrans (supervised) and SSC3DTrans (self-supervised). The dataset consisted of 80 videos from two basic laparoscopic tasks: peg transfer (PT) and knot tying (KT). To examine the potential of self-supervision, the models were trained on 60% and 100% of the annotated dataset. In addition, the best-performing model was evaluated on the JIGSAWS robotic surgery dataset. The best model (C3DTrans) achieves an accuracy of 88.0%, a 95.2% clip level, and 97.5% and 97.9% (gesture level), for PT and KT, respectively. The SSC3DTrans performed similar to C3DTrans when training on 60% of the annotated dataset (about 84% and 93% clip-level accuracies for PT and KT, respectively). The performance of C3DTrans on JIGSAWS was close to 76% accuracy, which was similar to or higher than prior techniques based on a single video stream, no additional video training, and online processing.",

        "abstract": "Background: Automated segmentation of COVID-19 infection lesions and the assessment of the severity of the infections are critical in COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. Based on a large amount of annotated data, deep learning approaches have been widely used in COVID-19 medical image analysis. However, the number of medical image samples is generally huge, and it is challenging to obtain enough annotated medical images for training a deep CNN model. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised deep learning method for automated segmentation of COVID-19 infection lesions and assessing the severity of infection, which can reduce the dependence on the annotation of the training samples. In the proposed method, first, many unlabeled data are used to pre-train an encoder-decoder model to learn rotation-dependent and rotation-invariant features. Then, a small amount of labeled data is used to fine-tune the pre-trained encoder-decoder for COVID-19 severity classification and lesion segmentation. Results: The proposed methods were tested on two public COVID-19 CT datasets and one self-built dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to measure classification performance and Dice coefficient was used to measure segmentation performance. For COVID-19 severity classification, the proposed method outperformed other unsupervised feature learning methods by about 7.16% in accuracy. For segmentation, when the amount of labeled data was 100%, the Dice value of the proposed method was 5.58% higher than that of U-Net.; in 70% of the cases, our method was 8.02% higher than U-Net; in 30% of the cases, our method was 11.88% higher than U-Net; and in 10% of the cases, our method was 16.88% higher than U-Net. Conclusions: The proposed method provides better classification and segmentation performance under limited labeled data than other methods.",

        "abstract": "In real world applications, data are often with multiple modalities. Researchers proposed the multi-modal learning approaches for integrating the information from different modalities. Most of the previous multi-modal methods assume that training examples are with complete modalities. However, due to the failures of data collection, self-deficiencies and other various reasons, multi-modal examples are usually with incomplete feature representation in real applications. In this paper, the incomplete feature representation issues in multi-modal learning are named as incomplete modalities, and we propose a semi-supervised multi-modal learning method aimed at this incomplete modal issue (SLIM). SLIM can utilize the extrinsic information from unlabeled data against the insufficiencies brought by the incomplete modal issues in a semi-supervised scenario. Besides, the proposed SLIM forms the problem into a unified framework which can be treated as a classifier or clustering learner, and integrate the intrinsic consistencies and extrinsic unlabeled information. As SLIM can extract the most discriminative predictors for each modality, experiments on 15 real world multi-modal datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as Word2vec, BERT, and GPT have shown great effectiveness in language understanding. Contrastive learning, as a recent SSL approach, has attracted increasing attention in NLP. Contrastive learning learns data representations by predicting whether two augmented data instances are generated from the same original data example. Previous contrastive learning methods perform data augmentation and contrastive learning separately. As a result, the augmented data may not be optimal for contrastive learning. To address this problem, we propose a four-level optimization framework that performs data augmentation and contrastive learning end-to-end, to enable the augmented data to be tailored to the contrastive learning task. This framework consists of four learning stages, including training machine translation models for sentence augmentation, pretraining a text encoder using contrastive learning, finetuning a text classification model, and updating weights of translation data by minimizing the validation loss of the classification model, which are performed in a unified way. Experiments on datasets in the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) and on datasets used in Gururangan et al. (2020) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSide Effects (SE) of drugs are one of the common reasons for drug failure that may halt the whole drug discovery pipeline. Therefore, predicting the side effects of the drug is vital in drug development, discovery, and design. Supervised machine learning-based side effects prediction task has recently received much attention since it reduces time, chemical waste, design complexity, risk of failure, and cost. The advancement of supervised learning approaches for predicting side effects have emerged as essential computational tools. Still, there are several challenges to predict drug side effects. Thus, a near-exhaustive survey is carried out in this paper on the use of supervised machine learning approaches employed in drug side effects prediction in the past two decades. In addition, this paper also summarized the drug descriptor required for the side effects prediction task, commonly utilized drug properties sources, computational models, and their performances. Finally, the research gap, open problems, and challenges for the further supervised learning-based side effects prediction task have been discussed.",

A comparative study was carried out by providing an experimental evaluation on networks trained in different setups using various scenarios from sunny days to rainy night scenes. The networks were tested for challenging, and less common, scenarios where cameras or lidars individually would not provide a reliable prediction. Our results suggest that semi-supervised learning and fusion techniques increase the overall performance of the network in challenging scenarios using less data annotations.",

        "abstract": "Visual saliency has emerged as a major visualization tool for interpreting deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. However, much of the existing research uses it as an analyzing tool rather than an inductive bias for policy learning. In this work, we use visual attention as an inductive bias for RL agents. We propose a novel self-supervised attention learning approach which can 1. learn to select regions of interest without explicit annotations, and 2. act as a plug for existing deep RL methods to improve the learning performance. We empirically show that the self-supervised attention-aware deep RL methods outperform the baselines in the context of both the rate of convergence and performance. Furthermore, the proposed self-supervised attention is not tied with specific policies, nor restricted to a specific scene. We posit that the proposed approach is a general self-supervised attention module for multi-task learning and transfer learning, and empirically validate the generalization ability of the proposed method. Finally, we show that our method learns meaningful object keypoints highlighting improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIdentifying the entirety of gene regulatory interactions in a biological system offers the possibility to determine the key molecular factors that affect important traits on the level of cells, tissues, and whole organisms. Despite the development of experimental approaches and technologies for identification of direct binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoter regions of downstream target genes, computational approaches that utilize large compendia of transcriptomics data are still the predominant methods used to predict direct downstream targets of TFs, and thus reconstruct genome‐wide gene‐regulatory networks (GRNs). These approaches can broadly be categorized into unsupervised and supervised, based on whether data about known, experimentally verified gene‐regulatory interactions are used in the process of reconstructing the underlying GRN. Here, we first describe the generic steps of supervised approaches for GRN reconstruction, since they have been recently shown to result in improved accuracy of the resulting networks?

        "abstract": "AbstractWe present improvements over our previous approach to automatic winter hydrometeor classification by means of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), using more data and improved training techniques to achieve higher accuracy on a more complicated dataset than we had previously demonstrated. As an advancement of our previous proof-of-concept study, this work demonstrates broader usefulness of deep CNNs by using a substantially larger and more diverse dataset, which we make publicly available, from many more snow events. We describe the collection, processing, and sorting of this dataset of over 25,000 high-quality multiple-angle snowflake camera (MASC) image chips split nearly evenly between five geometric classes: aggregate, columnar crystal, planar crystal, graupel, and small particle. Raw images were collected over 32 snowfall events between November 2014 and May 2016 near Greeley, Colorado and were processed with an automated cropping and normalization algorithm to yield 224x224 pixel images containing possible hydrometeors. From the bulk set of over 8,400,000 extracted images, a smaller dataset of 14,793 images was sorted by image quality and recognizability (Q&R) using manual inspection. A presorting network trained on the Q&R dataset was applied to all 8,400,000+ images to automatically collect a subset of 283,351 good snowflake images. Roughly 5,000 representative examples were then collected from this subset manually for each of the five geometric classes. With a higher emphasis on in-class variety than our previous work, the final dataset yields trained networks that better capture the imperfect cases and diverse forms that occur within the broad categories studied to achieve an accuracy of 96.2% on a vastly more challenging dataset.",

        "abstract": "Marine coastal ecosystems offer numerous ecosystem services and are therefore subject to a variety of stressors from anthropogenic activities. Environmental biomonitoring programs for effective management and conservation of coastal marine ecosystems are therefore crucial. Traditional monitoring has been based on macrofauna indices which are laborious and require expert knowledge. Recently, eDNA metabarcoding has become increasingly popular as it does not involve macrofauna species identification and is therefore cost and time inexpensive. Studies have shown that ecosystem monitoring based on eDNA metabarcoding is feasible and random forest (RF) algorithms can predict various biological indices, and therefore ecosystem health. To propose adequate designs for future eDNA metabarcoding-based marine coastal monitoring surveys, the aim of the study is to find out (1) What is the lower limit of reads for accurate RF predictions in coastal marine monitoring using microbial communities? (2) Is this limit the same for different monitoring targets? To achieve this goal, we exploited four different Illumina amplicon datasets obtained from bacterial communities in different costal environments. From these datasets, we predicted different objectives relevant for biomonitoring. For each dataset, those corresponding prediction objectives (labels) were predicted using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) as features. After construction of RF models using all available sequences of a dataset (full model, serving as benchmark for targeted prediction accuracy), we then successively down-sampled each dataset to lower sequence numbers. Prediction accuracies of the reduced models were then compared to the accuracies of the full models to assess the minimum number of features to obtain the targeted prediction accuracy. Our results show that there is no general answer to question (1) and that (2) the limit varies between different monitoring targets. We have identified the most informative criteria that are relevant to assess the sequencing depth required to predict a biomonitoring category using RF. This may guide future study designs and may help to estimate and control costs in applied routine DNA-based biomonitoring using RF to predict the biomonitoring target. In our contribution we will elucidate and discuss these criteria.",

        "abstract": "Canonical deep learning-based Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction relies on supervised learning methods which in turn requires large data sets of run-to-failure data to ensure model performance. In a large class of cases, run-to-failure data is difficult to collect in practice as it may be expensive and unsafe to operate assets until failure. As such, there is a need to leverage data that are not run-to-failure but may still contain some measurable, and thus learnable, degradation signal. In this paper, we propose utilizing self-supervised learning as a pretraining step to learn representations of the data which will enable efficient training on the downstream task of RUL prediction. The self-supervised learning task chosen is time series sequence ordering, a task that involves constructing tuples each consisting of $n$ sequences sampled from the time series and reordered with some probability $p$. Subsequently, a classifier is trained on the resulting binary classification task; distinguishing between correctly ordered and shuffled tuples. The classifier's weights are then transferred to the RUL-model and fine-tuned using run-to-failure data. We show that the proposed self-supervised learning scheme can retain performance when training on a fraction of the full data set. In addition, we show indications that self-supervised learning as a pretraining step can enhance the performance of the model even when training on the full run-to-failure data set. To conduct our experiments, we use a data set of simulated run-to-failure turbofan jet engines.",

However, there is a lack of their applications in transition metal (TM) complexes due to their flexible coordination environment, multiple accessible oxidation and spin states, despite the importance of these complexes in fine chemical synthesis, commodity production, and optical applications. Herein, we propose a joint semi-supervised junction-tree variational autoencoder (SSVAE) and artificial neural network (ANN) classifier model, coined as LiveTransForM (Ligand variational auto-encoder and Transfer learning For transition Metal complexes), for the design of octahedral TM complexes. LiveTransForM allows the design of ligands that build up TM complexes and the prediction of the spin states of the assembled complexes. We show that the accuracy of the classifier is improved when the latent variables from the SSVAE are used as input for the ANN model compared to those from the unsupervised VAE. Input augmentation using the three molecular axes also improves the accuracy of the classifier. 58 complexes with predicted spin states are then generated by LiveTransForM and the accuracy of their spin state labels are validated by density functional theory methods. Two design strategies, single mutation and seeded generation, are also introduced to allow the directed evolution of parent complexes towards desirable spin states and local modification of seed complexes to generate complexes with similar spin states, respectively.",

First, a 3D convolutional network extracts feature vectors from video clips for encoding spatial and short-term temporal features. Second, the feature vectors are fed into a transformer network for capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Two main models are proposed, based on the backbone framework: C3DTrans (supervised) and SSC3DTrans (self-supervised). The dataset consisted of 80 videos from two basic laparoscopic tasks: peg transfer (PT) and knot tying (KT). To examine the potential of self-supervision, the models were trained on 60% and 100% of the annotated dataset. In addition, the best-performing model was evaluated on the JIGSAWS robotic surgery dataset. The best model (C3DTrans) achieves an accuracy of 88.0%, a 95.2% clip level, and 97.5% and 97.9% (gesture level), for PT and KT, respectively. The SSC3DTrans performed similar to C3DTrans when training on 60% of the annotated dataset (about 84% and 93% clip-level accuracies for PT and KT, respectively). The performance of C3DTrans on JIGSAWS was close to 76% accuracy, which was similar to or higher than prior techniques based on a single video stream, no additional video training, and online processing.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSide Effects (SE) of drugs are one of the common reasons for drug failure that may halt the whole drug discovery pipeline. Therefore, predicting the side effects of the drug is vital in drug development, discovery, and design. Supervised machine learning-based side effects prediction task has recently received much attention since it reduces time, chemical waste, design complexity, risk of failure, and cost. The advancement of supervised learning approaches for predicting side effects have emerged as essential computational tools. Still, there are several challenges to predict drug side effects. Thus, a near-exhaustive survey is carried out in this paper on the use of supervised machine learning approaches employed in drug side effects prediction in the past two decades. In addition, this paper also summarized the drug descriptor required for the side effects prediction task, commonly utilized drug properties sources, computational models, and their performances. Finally, the research gap, open problems, and challenges for the further supervised learning-based side effects prediction task have been discussed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) methods such as Word2vec, BERT, and GPT have shown great effectiveness in language understanding. Contrastive learning, as a recent SSL approach, has attracted increasing attention in NLP. Contrastive learning learns data representations by predicting whether two augmented data instances are generated from the same original data example. Previous contrastive learning methods perform data augmentation and contrastive learning separately. As a result, the augmented data may not be optimal for contrastive learning. To address this problem, we propose a four-level optimization framework that performs data augmentation and contrastive learning end-to-end, to enable the augmented data to be tailored to the contrastive learning task. This framework consists of four learning stages, including training machine translation models for sentence augmentation, pretraining a text encoder using contrastive learning, finetuning a text classification model, and updating weights of translation data by minimizing the validation loss of the classification model, which are performed in a unified way. Experiments on datasets in the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) and on datasets used in Gururangan et al. (2020) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "In real world applications, data are often with multiple modalities. Researchers proposed the multi-modal learning approaches for integrating the information from different modalities. Most of the previous multi-modal methods assume that training examples are with complete modalities. However, due to the failures of data collection, self-deficiencies and other various reasons, multi-modal examples are usually with incomplete feature representation in real applications. In this paper, the incomplete feature representation issues in multi-modal learning are named as incomplete modalities, and we propose a semi-supervised multi-modal learning method aimed at this incomplete modal issue (SLIM). SLIM can utilize the extrinsic information from unlabeled data against the insufficiencies brought by the incomplete modal issues in a semi-supervised scenario. Besides, the proposed SLIM forms the problem into a unified framework which can be treated as a classifier or clustering learner, and integrate the intrinsic consistencies and extrinsic unlabeled information. As SLIM can extract the most discriminative predictors for each modality, experiments on 15 real world multi-modal datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Background: Automated segmentation of COVID-19 infection lesions and the assessment of the severity of the infections are critical in COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. Based on a large amount of annotated data, deep learning approaches have been widely used in COVID-19 medical image analysis. However, the number of medical image samples is generally huge, and it is challenging to obtain enough annotated medical images for training a deep CNN model. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised deep learning method for automated segmentation of COVID-19 infection lesions and assessing the severity of infection, which can reduce the dependence on the annotation of the training samples. In the proposed method, first, many unlabeled data are used to pre-train an encoder-decoder model to learn rotation-dependent and rotation-invariant features. Then, a small amount of labeled data is used to fine-tune the pre-trained encoder-decoder for COVID-19 severity classification and lesion segmentation. Results: The proposed methods were tested on two public COVID-19 CT datasets and one self-built dataset. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to measure classification performance and Dice coefficient was used to measure segmentation performance. For COVID-19 severity classification, the proposed method outperformed other unsupervised feature learning methods by about 7.16% in accuracy. For segmentation, when the amount of labeled data was 100%, the Dice value of the proposed method was 5.58% higher than that of U-Net.; in 70% of the cases, our method was 8.02% higher than U-Net; in 30% of the cases, our method was 11.88% higher than U-Net; and in 10% of the cases, our method was 16.88% higher than U-Net. Conclusions: The proposed method provides better classification and segmentation performance under limited labeled data than other methods.",

Data mining and supervised learning have applications in multiple fields of science and research. Machine learning looks at patterns of data and helps to predict future behaviour by learning from the patterns. Data mining is normally used as a source of information on which machine learning can be applied to solve some of problems in our daily life. Supervised learning is one type of machine learning method which uses labelled data consisting of input along with the label of inputs and generates one learned model (or classifier for classification type work) which can be used to label unknown data.

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays an important role in medical diagnosis and treatment; different modalities of MR images can provide rich and complementary information to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. However, due to the limitations of scanning time and medical conditions, certain modalities of MR may be unavailable or of low quality in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a new multimodal MR image synthesis network to generate missing MR images. The proposed model comprises three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and image generation. During feature extraction, 2D and 3D self-supervised pretext tasks are introduced to pre-train the backbone for better representations of each modality. Then, a channel attention mechanism is used when fusing features so that the network can adaptively weigh different fusion operations to learn common representations of all modalities. Finally, a generative adversarial network is considered as the basic framework to generate images, in which a feature-level edge information loss is combined with the pixel-wise loss to ensure consistency between the synthesized and real images in terms of anatomical characteristics. 2D and 3D self-supervised pre-training can have better performance on feature extraction to retain more details in the synthetic images. Moreover, the proposed multimodal attention feature fusion block (MAFFB) in the well-designed layer-wise fusion strategy can model both common and unique information in all modalities, consistent with the clinical analysis. We also perform an interpretability analysis to confirm the rationality and effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can be applied in both single-modal and multimodal synthesis with high robustness and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches objectively and subjectively.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular research area in machine learning which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. As an important method for the generation of artificial hard labels for unlabeled data, the pseudo-labeling method is introduced by applying a high and fixed threshold in most state-of-the-art SSL models. However, early models prefer certain classes that are easy to learn, which results in a high-skewed class imbalance in the generated hard labels. The class imbalance will lead to less effective learning of other minority classes and slower convergence for the training model. The aim of this paper is to mitigate the performance degradation caused by class imbalance and gradually reduce the class imbalance in the unsupervised part. To achieve this objective, we propose FocalMatch, a novel SSL method that combines FixMatch and focal loss. Our contribution of FocalMatch adjusts the loss weight of various data depending on how well their predictions match up with their pseudo labels, which can accelerate system learning and model convergence and achieve state-of-the-art performance on several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. Particularly, its effectiveness is demonstrated with the dataset that has extremely limited labeled data.",

The identification of co-localized molecules in MSI data is crucial to the understanding of biochemical pathways. However, complex MSI data are too large for manual annotation but too small for training deep networks. Herein, we introduce a self-supervised clustering approach based on contrastive learning, which shows an excellent performance in clustering of small MSI data. We train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using MSI data from a single experiment without manual annotations to effectively learn high-level spatial features from ion images and classify them based on molecular colocalizations. We demonstrate that contrastive learning generates ion image representations that form well-resolved clusters. Subsequent self-labeling is used to fine-tune both the CNN encoder and linear classifier based on confidently classified ion images. This new approach enables autonomous and high-throughput identification of co-localized species in MSI data, which will dramatically expand the application of spatial lipidomics, metabolomics, and proteomics in biological research.",

        "abstract": "In cancer diagnostics, a considerable amount of data is acquired during routine work-up. Recently, machine learning has been used to build classifiers that are tasked with cancer detection and aid in clinical decision-making. Most of these classifiers are based on supervised learning (SL) that needs time- and cost-intensive manual labeling of samples by medical experts for model training. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), however, works with only a fraction of labeled data by including unlabeled samples for information abstraction and thus can utilize the vast discrepancy between available labeled data and overall available data in cancer diagnostics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of essential functionalities and assumptions of SSL and survey key studies with regard to cancer care differentiating between image-based and non-image-based applications. We highlight current state-of-the-art models in histopathology, radiology and radiotherapy, as well as genomics. Further, we discuss potential pitfalls in SSL study design such as discrepancies in data distributions and comparison to baseline SL models, and point out future directions for SSL in oncology. We believe well-designed SSL models to strongly contribute to computer-guided diagnostics in malignant disease by overcoming current hinderances in the form of sparse labeled and abundant unlabeled data.",

        "abstract": "Computational pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies into diagnostic workflows. It offers unprecedented opportunities for improved efficiency in treatment decisions by allowing pathologists to achieve higher precision and objectivity in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First, we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in the literature. This paves the way for the development of a foundation model for histopathology. Our code, models and features are publicly available athttps://github.com/owkin/HistoSSLscaling.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nSelecting and prioritizing candidate disease genes is necessary before conducting laboratory studies as identifying disease genes from a large number of candidate genes using laboratory methods, is a very costly and time-consuming task. There are many machine learning-based gene prioritization methods. These methods differ in various aspects including the feature vectors of genes, the used datasets with different structures, and the learning model. Creating a suitable feature vector for genes and an appropriate learning model on a variety of data with different and non-Euclidean structures, including graphs, as well as the lack of negative data are very important challenges of these methods. The use of graph neural networks has recently emerged in machine learning and other related fields, and they have demonstrated superior performance for a broad range of problems.\n\nMethods\nIn this study, a new semi-supervised learning method based on graph convolutional networks is presented using the novel constructing feature vector for each gene. In the proposed method, first, we construct three feature vectors for each gene using terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. Then, we train a graph convolution network on these vectors using protein–protein interaction (PPI) network data to identify disease candidate genes. Our model discovers hidden layer representations encoding in both local graph structure as well as features of nodes. This method is characterized by the simultaneous consideration of topological information of the biological network (e.g., PPI) and other sources of evidence. Finally, a validation has been done to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.\n\nResults\nSeveral experiments are performed on 16 diseases to evaluate the proposed method's performance. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best results, in terms of precision, the area under the ROC curve (AUCs), and F1-score values, when compared with eight state-of-the-art network and machine learning-based disease gene prioritization methods.\n\nConclusion\nThis study shows that the proposed semi-supervised learning method appropriately classifies and ranks candidate disease genes using a graph convolutional network and an innovative method to create three feature vectors for genes based on the molecular function, cellular component, and biological process terms from GO data.\n",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTMetagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and allow the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we propose SemiBin, an open source tool that uses neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of binning genomes that are outside the reference dataset. SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods in simulated and real microbiome datasets across three different environments (human gut, dog gut, and marine microbiomes). SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species.

        "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a complicated, non-stationary signal that requires extensive preprocessing and feature extraction approaches to be accurately analyzed. In recent times, Deep learning (DL) has shown great promise in exploiting the characteristics of EEG signals as it can learn relevant features from raw data autonomously. Although studies involving DL have become more common in the last two years, the topic of whether DL truly delivers advantages over conventional Machine learning (ML) methodologies remains unsettled. This study aims to present a detailed overview of the main challenges in the field of seizure detection, prediction, and classification utilizing EEG data, and the approaches taken to solve them using ML and DL methods. A systematic review was conducted surveying peer-reviewed publications published between 2017 and 16 July 2022 using two scientific databases (Web of Science and Scopus) totaling 6822 references after discarding duplicate publications. Whereas 2262 articles were screened based on the title, abstract, and keywords, only 214 were eligible for full-text assessment. A total of 91 papers have been included in this survey after meeting the eligible inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most significant findings from the review are summarized, and several important concepts involving ML and DL for seizure detection, prediction, and classification are discussed in further depth. This review aims to learn more about the different approaches for identifying different types and stages of epileptic seizures, which may then be employed to enhance the lives of epileptic patients in the future, as well as aid experts in the field.",

This study leverages self-supervised learning and unlabeled images from the National Skin Disease Database of Japan (NSDD) to enhance skin disease classification. By generating pre-trained models using three self-supervised learning methods, and comparing them to a baseline pre-trained model on ImageNet, we found that pre-training with unlabeled images increased transfer learning performance by 1-2% on labeled images in the NSDD. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the pre-trained models across four public dermatological image datasets. We further implemented a hybrid pre-training approach that combines self-supervised and supervised learning, and observed accuracy improvements in certain datasets. Since the optimal strategy is task and dataset-specific, we proposed an ensemble of transfer learned models from diverse pre-training methods for robust classification. The ensemble approach consistently enhanced accuracy across various datasets, with an improvement by up to 8.3% from the baseline, confirming the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training with unlabeled dermatological images even when the images are mainly from one ethnic group.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have ushered in a vast array of different types of low cost and reliable sensors that are capable of capturing large quantities of audio and visual information from the natural world. In the case of biodiversity monitoring, camera traps (i.e. remote cameras that take images when movement is detected (Kays et al. 2009) have shown themselves to be particularly effective tools for the automated monitoring of the presence and activity of different animal species. However, this ease of deployment comes at a cost, as even a small scale camera trapping project can result in hundreds of thousands of images that need to be reviewed. \nUntil recently, this review process was an extremely time consuming endeavor. It required domain experts to manually inspect each image to:\n\n\n\ndetermine if it contained a species of interest and\n\n\nidentify, where possible, which species was present. Fortunately, in the last five years, advances in machine learning have resulted in a new suite of algorithms that are capable of automatically performing image classification tasks like species classification.\n\n\n\ndetermine if it contained a species of interest and\nidentify, where possible, which species was present. Fortunately, in the last five years, advances in machine learning have resulted in a new suite of algorithms that are capable of automatically performing image classification tasks like species classification.\nThe effectiveness of deep neural networks (Norouzzadeh et al. 2018), coupled with transfer learning (tuning a model that is pretrained on a larger dataset (Willi et al. 2018), have resulted in high levels of accuracy on camera trap images.\nHowever, camera trap images exhibit unique challenges that are typically not present in standard benchmark datasets used in computer vision. For example, objects of interest are often heavily occluded, the appearance of a scene can change dramatically over time due to changes in weather and lighting, and while the overall number of images can be large, the variation in locations is often limited (Schneider et al. 2020). These challenges combined mean that in order to reach high performance on species classification it is necessary to collect a large amount of annotated data to train the deep models. This again takes a significant amount of time for each project, and this time could be better spent addressing the ecological or conservation questions of interest.\nSelf-supervised learning is a paradigm in machine learning that attempts to forgo the need for manual supervision by instead learning informative representations from images directly, e.g. transforming an image in two different ways without impacting the semantics of the included object, and learn by imposing similarity between the two tranformations. This is a tantalizing proposition for camera trap data, as it has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of time required to annotate data. The current performance of these methods on standard computer vision benchmarks is encouraging, as it suggests that self-supervised models have begun to reach the accuracy of their fully supervised counterparts for tasks like classifying everyday objects in images (Chen et al. 2020). However, existing self-supervised methods can struggle when applied to tasks that contain highly similar, i.e. fine-grained, object categories such as different species of plants and animals (Van Horn et al. 2021).\nTo this end, we explore the effectiveness of self-supervised learning when applied to camera trap imagery. We show that these methods can be used to train image classifiers with a significant reduction in manual supervision. Furthermore, we extend this analysis by showing, with some careful design considerations, that off-the-shelf self-supervised methods can be made to learn even more effective image representations for automated species classification. We show that by exploiting cues at training time related to where and when a given image was captured can result in further improvements in classification performance. We demonstrate, across several different camera trapping datasets, that it is possible to achieve similar, and sometimes even superior, accuracy to fully supervised transfer learning-based methods using a factor of ten times less manual supervision. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of the outlined approaches and their implications on automated species classification from images.",

However, much of the existing research uses it as an analyzing tool rather than an inductive bias for policy learning. In this work, we use visual attention as an inductive bias for RL agents. We propose a novel self-supervised attention learning approach which can 1. learn to select regions of interest without explicit annotations, and 2. act as a plug for existing deep RL methods to improve the learning performance. We empirically show that the self-supervised attention-aware deep RL methods outperform the baselines in the context of both the rate of convergence and performance. Furthermore, the proposed self-supervised attention is not tied with specific policies, nor restricted to a specific scene. We posit that the proposed approach is a general self-supervised attention module for multi-task learning and transfer learning, and empirically validate the generalization ability of the proposed method. Finally, we show that our method learns meaningful object keypoints highlighting improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "abstract": "Multi-modal learning refers to the process of learning a precise model to represent the joint representations of different modalities. Despite its promise for multi-modal learning, the co-regularization method is based on the consistency principle with a sufficient assumption, which usually does not hold for real-world multi-modal data. Indeed, due to the modal insufficiency in real-world applications, there are divergences among heterogeneous modalities. This imposes a critical challenge for multi-modal learning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Comprehensive Multi-Modal Learning (CMML) framework, which can strike a balance between the consistency and divergency modalities by considering the insufficiency in one unified framework. Specifically, we utilize an instance level attention mechanism to weight the sufficiency for each instance on different modalities. Moreover, novel diversity regularization and robust consistency metrics are designed for discovering insufficient modalities. Our empirical studies show the superior performances of CMML on real-world data in terms of various criteria.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPerson Re-identification (Re-ID) algorithms based on deep learning are developing rapidly, and supervised learning methods ensure a steady improvement in algorithm performance by virtue of massive amounts of data. However, in the real environment, data collection and labeling of the current scene is time-consuming and laborious, and the actual performance of the algorithmic model is often poor. Therefore, the design of the model should focus on extracting and abstracting the information contained in the data under limited conditions. In this paper, we focus on the problems of strong data since, weak cross-domain capability and low accuracy encountered in Re-ID in weakly supervised scenarios. First, we implement a joint training framework with the help of small sample learning and cross-domain migration for Re-ID. Second, an residual compensation and fusion attention (RCFA) module is designed with the help of residual compensation and fused attention module, based on which a model base framework is built to explore the impact brought by different insertion positions. Third, to solve the problem of low accuracy caused by insufficient data coverage of small samples, a fusion of shallow features and deep features is designed to enable the model to weighted fusion of shallow detail information and deep semantic information. Finally, by selecting different camera images in Market1501 dataset and DukeMTMC-reID dataset as small samples respectively, and introducing another dataset data for joint training, we demonstrate the feasibility of this joint training framework, which can perform weakly supervised cross-domain Re-ID based on small sample data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Verbal Autopsy (VA) is a tool commonly used in low to medium income countries to ascertain cause of death, where most deaths are not assigned a medically certified cause. As such, they strengthen health priorities, inform policy, practice and provide vital information where civil registration systems are weak. Physician diagnosis is used as a gold standard to determine cause of death, from VA interviews even though it is inconsistent and expensive. Alternatively, conventional computer algorithms and machine learning approaches have been applied.However, they fail to perform optimally because of data quality and ineffective strategies that they employ. We present a robust machine learning framework that can accurately classify cause of death using only narratives from VA interviews. Methods: Experiments started with data acquisition of the VA narratives, followed by data preprocessing. We created numeric vectors to represent the narratives using various feature engineering techniques for twelve cause of death categories. Furthermore, we applied data balancing, feature scaling, hyper-parameter tuning and dimensionality reduction in order to improve model performance. We applied eight different classification approaches to the vectors to generate model predictors of cause of death. Validation was done using Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROCAUC). Results: We used the physician diagnosis as our gold standard for validation of our models. Our five best classifiers attained a Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F1-score of 95%, 94%, 93%, 92% and 91% respectively in cause of death classification of all twelve disease categories. We report on Micro-Average ROCAUC of 96% and Macro-Average ROCAUC of 95% of our twelve classes. Conclusion: Our proposed robust machine learning framework can be a faster and cost effective way to determine cause of death from rich informative unstructured VA narratives. This study can also serve as a benchmark of model comparability and generalisation of machine learning models in determining cause of death using VA data. Our study was limited in terms of data quality. Future work aims at using combined responses and narratives for our models and also applying deep learning architectures for cause of death classification using VAs.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nChatGPT is becoming a new reality. Where do we go from here?\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nis to show how we can distinguish ChatGPT-generated publications from counterparts produced by biomedical scientists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBy means of a new algorithm, called xFakeBibs, we show the significant difference between ChatGPT-generated fake publications and real publications. Specifically, we triggered ChatGPT to generate 100 publications that were related to Alzheimer’s disease and comorbidity. Using the TF-IDF measure against a dataset of real publications, we constructed a network training model of the bigrams extracted from 100 publications. By 10-folds of 100 publications each, we built 10 calibrating networks to derive lower/upper bounds for classifying an article as real or fake. The final step of the algorithm is designed to test xFakeBibs against each of the ChatGPT-generated articles and predict its class.  The xFakeBibs algorithm successfully assigned the POSITIVE label for real and NEGATIVE for fake ones.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen comparing the training model with the calibration models, we found that the similarities fluctuated between (19%-21%) of bigram overlaps. The calibrating folds contributed (51%-70%) of new bigrams, while ChatGPT contributed only 23% (> 50% of any of the other 10 calibrating folds). When classifying the individual articles, the xFakeBibs algorithm predicted 98/100 publications as fake, while 2 articles failed the test and were classified as real publications.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis work provided clear evidence on how to distinguish ChatGPT-generated articles from real articles. The analysis demonstrated how such contents are distinguishable in bulk. Also, the algorithmic approach demonstrated the detection the individual fake articles with a high degree of accuracy. However, it remains challenging to detect all fake records. ChatGPT may seem to be a useful tool, but it certainly presents a threat to our authentic knowledge and real science. This work is indeed a step in the right direction to counter fake science and misinformation.\n\n\nCLINICALTRIAL\nN/A\n",

Therefore, this study attempts to use computer vision methods to guide drivers to park. In this paper, we first divide all the parking lots into single parking spot by the Hough transform. Then a supervised learning method is proposed to classify every single parking spot into car spots and non-car spots. In this classification problem, we adopt the CNN (convolution neural network) method to extract every single spot’s features and put the spot into the corresponding category. For the whole network, VGG-19, which can extract a deeper feature, is adopted to get a more precise classification. Also, we adopt the Adam optimizer replacing the SGD optimizer in the former work, which relies little on the learning rate. It shows that the Adam optimizer gets better loss convergence in the training process. After collecting the results of the prediction for the test videos, it shows that the deeper network VGG-19 improves the accuracy of predicting a driver spot.",

A comparative study was carried out by providing an experimental evaluation on networks trained in different setups using various scenarios from sunny days to rainy night scenes. The networks were tested for challenging, and less common, scenarios where cameras or lidars individually would not provide a reliable prediction. Our results suggest that semi-supervised learning and fusion techniques increase the overall performance of the network in challenging scenarios using less data annotations.",

        "abstract": "Detecting construction equipment and classifying their activities are important steps for evaluating their performance and productivity on construction sites. To this end, many automated activity monitoring frameworks based on computer vision have been developed. However, most of the current state-of-the-art activity recognition methods for construction equipment are based on supervised deep learning methods. A major drawback of these approaches is that large, annotated datasets are required for each equipment and activity. To address this problem, this work adapts and customizes the self-supervised, spatiotemporal contrastive video representation learning method for excavator activity recognition. Self-supervised methods use the spatiotemporal information present in video frames as a source of information for pre-training a deep neural network without labels, which is then fine-tuned using a few labeled data. The results show the potential of this method, obtaining the recognition accuracy of 84.6% while using only 10% of the labeled data in an available dataset.",

In the existing solutions, most of the methods rely on paired images, that is, the rain image and the real image without rain in the same scene. However, in many cases, the paired images are difficult to obtain, which makes it impossible to apply the raindrop removal network in many scenarios. Therefore this article proposes a semi-supervised rain-removing network apply to unpaired images. The model contains two parts: a supervised network and an unsupervised network. After the model is trained, the unsupervised network does not require paired images and it can get a clean image without raindrops. In particular, our network can perform training on paired and unpaired samples. The experimental results show that the best results are achieved not only on the supervised rain-removing network, but also on the unsupervised rain-removing network.",

        "abstract": "<p>To increase the detectability of breast cancer, recent efforts have been made in the field of grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography, which provides additional information about the refractive index decrement introduced by the sample. Whereas this signal shows an increased soft-tissue contrast, the implementation for polychromatic sources is still tied to higher doses, preventing medical application on patients. To lower the dose, we introduce the self-supervised deep learning network Noise2Inverse into the grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography field and compare its results with other denoising methods, namely the Statistical Iterative Reconstruction, Block Matching 3D, and Patchwise Phase Retrieval. Before the comparison, the behavior of Noise2Inverse parameters on the phase-contrast results are evaluated. We show that Noise2Inverse delivers superior denoising results with respect to the investigated image quality metrics. Its application allows the increase of resolution while maintaining a good contrast-to-noise ratio. This could enable grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography to outperform conventional absorption-based computed tomography in dose-relevant applications.</p>",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPURPOSEAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that progressively deteriorates memory and cognitive abilities. PET 18F-AV45 (florbetapir) is a common imaging modality used to characterize the distribution of beta-amyloid deposits in the brain, however interpretation may be subjective and the misdiagnosis rate of AD ranges from 12-23%. Automated algorithms for PET 18F-AV45 interpretation including those derived from deep learning may facilitate more objective and accurate AD diagnosis.MATERIALS & METHODSA total of 1232 PET AV45 scans (207 - AD; 1025 - normal) were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A semi-supervised deep learning framework was developed to differentiate AD and normal patients. The framework consists of an autoencoder (AE), a contrastive learning loss, and a categorical classification head. A contrastive learning paradigm is used to improve the discriminative properties of latent feature vectors in multidimensional space.RESULTSUpon five-fold cross-validation, the best-performing semi-supervised contrastive model achieved validation accuracy of 82% to 86%. Secondary analysis included visualization of intermediate activations, classification report verification, and principal component analysis (PCA) of latent feature vectors. The training process yielded optimal converging losses for all three loss frameworks.CONCLUSIONA deep learning model can accurately diagnose AD using PET 18F-AV45 scans. Such models require large amounts of labeled data during training. The use of a semi-supervised contrastive learning objective and AE regularizer helps to improve model performance, especially when dataset sizes are constrained. Latent representations extracted by the model are visually clustered strongly with the addition of a contrastive learning mechanism.Summary StatementA semi-supervised contrastive learning deep learning system optimizes latent feature vector representations and yields strong model classification performance for larger data distributions within the Alzheimer’s Disease diagnostics domain.Key PointsA common diagnostic procedure used by trained radiologists in the clinical setting is the visual analysis of PET 18F-AV45 neuroimaging scans to diagnose the different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease in a patient.Contrastive learning is a strategy that allows for the optimization of latent feature representations in multidimensional space through the use of a loss function that maximizes the distance between feature vectors of different classes and minimizes the distance of feature vectors of the same class.A semi-supervised contrastive learning approach can lead to improved performance and generalization of deep learning models optimized using small training datasets as encountered in Alzheimer’s Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPicking particles of biological macromolecules from their cryo-electron tomograms is critical to solving their 3D structuresin situ. To reach sub-nanometre resolution, large numbers of particles often need to be picked, a laborious and time-consuming task if performed manually. To date, however, the adoption of automated particle-picking methods remains limited because of the limitations in their accuracy, processing speed and, for those based on learning models, manual annotation cost. To overcome the limitations, we develop DeepETPicker, a deep learning model for fast and accurate picking of 3D particles from cryo-electron tomograms. The training of DeepETPicker requires only weak supervision with low numbers of simplified Gaussian-type labels, reducing the burden of manual annotation of tomograms under very low signal-to-noise ratios. The simplified labels combined with the customized and lightweight model architecture of DeepETPicker as well as GPU-accelerated pooling enable substantially improved accuracy and accelerated processing speed. When tested on simulated as well as real tomograms, DeepETPicker outperforms the competing state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest overall accuracy and speed, which translate into better quality of picked particles and higher resolutions of final reconstruction maps. DeepETPicker is provided in open source with a user-friendly interface to support automated particle picking for high-resolution cryo-electron tomographyin situ.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSo far we have discussed unsupervised learning, the inference of the underlying statistical structure (and adequate representations) of a set of data. Another fundamental field of application of machine learning is supervised learning, which is the task of learning an input-output relationship. Supervised learning assumes the existence of a function that associates a label, e.g. dog or cat, to each data point, e.g. an image. In practice, the machine tries to learn this function from a limited set of input-output examples. At the end of learning, one should be able to predict the right class for any input, not necessarily belonging to the data set: does this new image correspond to a dog or to a cat? In this chapter, we address two questions: How can supervised learning and classification be done in practice? How many data does one need to generalise, i.e. to avoid overfitting the examples? We will start by discussing perceptrons, also called support vector machines (SVM), which are neural networks with no hidden layer and have set the state of the art in classification for decades, and we will then turn to more complex neural networks.",

Whereas this signal shows an increased soft-tissue contrast, the implementation for polychromatic sources is still tied to higher doses, preventing medical application on patients. To lower the dose, we introduce the self-supervised deep learning network Noise2Inverse into the grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography field and compare its results with other denoising methods, namely the Statistical Iterative Reconstruction, Block Matching 3D, and Patchwise Phase Retrieval. Before the comparison, the behavior of Noise2Inverse parameters on the phase-contrast results are evaluated. We show that Noise2Inverse delivers superior denoising results with respect to the investigated image quality metrics. Its application allows the increase of resolution while maintaining a good contrast-to-noise ratio. This could enable grating-based phase-contrast computed tomography to outperform conventional absorption-based computed tomography in dose-relevant applications.</p>",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe visual system of mammals is comprised of parallel, hierarchical specialized pathways. Different pathways are specialized in so far as they use representations that are more suitable for supporting specific downstream behaviours. In particular, the clearest example is the specialization of the ventral (“what”) and dorsal (“where”) pathways of the visual cortex. These two pathways support behaviours related to visual recognition and movement, respectively. To-date, deep neural networks have mostly been used as models of the ventral, recognition pathway. However, it is unknown whether both pathways can be modelled with a single deep ANN. Here, we ask whether a single model with a single loss function can capture the properties of both the ventral and the dorsal pathways. We explore this question using data from mice, who like other mammals, have specialized pathways that appear to support recognition and movement behaviours. We show that when we train a deep neural network architecture with two parallel pathways using a self-supervised predictive loss function, we can outperform other models in fitting mouse visual cortex. Moreover, we can model both the dorsal and ventral pathways. These results demonstrate that a self-supervised predictive learning approach applied to parallel pathway architectures can account for some of the functional specialization seen in mammalian visual systems.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has become one of the most important concepts in various aspects of our modern life in recent years. However, the most critical challenge for the world-wide use of the IoT is to address its security issues. One of the most important tasks to address the security challenges in the IoT is to detect intrusion in the network. Although the machine/deep learning-based solutions have been repeatedly used to detect network intrusion through recent years, there is still considerable potential to improve the accuracy and performance of the classifier (intrusion detector). In this paper, we develop a novel training algorithm to better tune the parameters of the used deep architecture. To specifically do so, we first introduce a novel neighborhood search-based particle swarm optimization (NSBPSO) algorithm to improve the exploitation/exploration of the PSO algorithm. Next, we use the advantage of NSBPSO to optimally train the deep architecture as our network intrusion detector in order to obtain better accuracy and performance. For evaluating the performance of the proposed classifier, we use two network intrusion detection datasets named UNSW-NB15 and Bot-IoT to rate the accuracy and performance of the proposed classifier.",

The only effective solution to this global issue is to implement machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI (Air Quality Index ) that can make the people aware of the condition of the air of a certain region such that certain actions could be issued by the government for the improvement of the air quality in the future. The prime objective behind this project is to predict the AQI based on the concentration of PM2.5, PM10,S02, N02, C0 as well as weather conditions like temperature, pressure and humidity[2].Hence the data set is combined from various web sources like cpcb.nic.in and uci repository in order to bring accuracy in the prediction and to justify whether the Quality of air is suitable or not. This prediction will be brought about with the help of some supervised machine learning algorithms and the observation and the result will state which algorithm is giving better accuracy in prediction of AQI and which one is giving less error.</p>",

The non-Hermitian model maintains the chiral symmetry. We find that trained neuron networks can reproduce the topological phase diagram of our model with high accuracy. This successful reproduction goes beyond the parameter space used in the training process. Through analyzing the intermediate output of the networks, we attribute the success of the networks to their mastery of computation of the winding number.

        "abstract": "<div>We propose a deep-learning based annotation efficient framework for vessel detection in ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus photography (FP) that does not require de novo labeled UWF FP vessel maps. Our approach utilizes concurrently captured UWF fluorescein angiography (FA) images, for which effective deep learning approaches have recently become available, and iterates between a multi-modal registration step and a weakly-supervised learning step. In the registration step, the UWF FA vessel maps detected with a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) are registered with the UWF FP via parametric chamfer alignment. The warped vessel maps can be used as the tentative training data but inevitably contain incorrect (noisy) labels due to the differences between FA and FP modalities and the errors in the registration. In the learning step, a robust learning method is proposed to train DNNs with noisy labels. The detected FP vessel maps are used for the registration in the following iteration. The registration and the vessel detection benefit from each other and are progressively improved. Once trained, the UWF FP vessel detection DNN from the proposed approach allows FP vessel detection without requiring concurrently captured UWF FA images. We validate the proposed framework on a new UWF FP dataset, PRIMEFP20, and on existing narrow field FP datasets. Experimental evaluation, using both pixel wise metrics and the CAL metrics designed to provide better agreement with human assessment, shows that the proposed approach provides accurate vessel detection, without requiring manually labeled UWF FP training data.</div>",

        "abstract": "The copper mining industry is increasingly using artificial intelligence methods to improve copper production processes. Recent studies reveal the use of algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, among others, to develop models for predicting product quality. Other studies compare the predictive models developed with these machine learning algorithms in the mining industry as a whole. However, not many copper mining studies published compare the results of machine learning techniques for copper recovery prediction. This study makes a detailed comparison between three models for predicting copper recovery by leaching, using four datasets resulting from mining operations in Northern Chile. The algorithms used for developing the models were Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network. To validate these models, four indicators or values of merit were used: accuracy (acc), precision (p), recall (r), and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (mcc). This paper describes the dataset preparation and the refinement of the threshold values used for the predictive variable most influential on the class (the copper recovery). Results show both a precision over 98.50% and also the model with the best behavior between the predicted and the real values. Finally, the obtained models have the following mean values: acc = 0.943, p = 88.47, r = 0.995, and mcc = 0.232. These values are highly competitive when compared with those obtained in similar studies using other approaches in the context.",

The data collected cover the period  from January 2020 to February 2023 with a daily frequency for the three most imported refined petroleum products in Morocco and trained four regression machines learning (linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and SVR) and four classifiers machine learning (logistic regression, decision tree, extra tree and Random Forest) so that anticipating one day ahead prices direction can take place no matter whether they are negative or positive prices. The performance of regression algorithm is then evaluated using different evaluation metrics, especially MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE and R2 to evaluate the performance of regression algorithm while precision, recall and F1 scores are used to evaluate the performance of classifiers algorithm. The outcomes propose that the performance of linear regression and ridge regression takes place equally and outperform other single regression that is lasso regression and SVR for-one-day predictions as a whole. In addition to that, we have come to find that in the classifiers, algorithms group all machine learning display similar predictive accuracy, this is on one hand. On the other hand, the best of them is the logistic regression. In brief, this study suggests that all performance metrics are significantly improved by ensemble learning. Therefore, this study proves that critical information affecting stock movement can be captured by utilizing historical transactions.",

Therefore, we propose a novel approach of applying machine learning, a branch of the field of artificial intelligence, to a variety of information concerning people’s lives (i.e., a lifelog). We asked a participant (a healthy young man) to record 55 lifelog items (e.g., positive mood, negative events, sleep time etc.) in his daily life for about eight months using smartphone apps and a smartwatch. We then constructed a predictor to estimate the degree of happiness from the multimodal lifelog data using a support vector machine, which achieved 82.6% prediction accuracy. This suggests that our approach can predict the behaviors that increase individuals’ happiness in their daily lives, thereby contributing to improvement in their happiness. Future studies examining the usability and clinical applicability of this approach would benefit from a larger and more diverse sample size.",

        "abstract": "\nABSTRACT:\nCompressional wave (P-wave) travel time is an important sonic log that can be utilized to indirectly estimate geomechanical properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. Unfortunately, sonic travel-time logs are often absent in the conventional well log suites and need to be interpreted from other well logs. Many previous studies have developed data-driven models to synthesize the sonic logs, but those models have not been thoroughly evaluated for its prediction accuracy using field cases from several depositional basins. The objective of this study is to develop supervised machine learning models to accurately predict the P-wave travel time from the conventional well logs (i.e., Gamma Ray, bulk density, and neutron porosity) for a wide range of lithologies with the incorporation of confining stress effect by including the true vertical depth as an input. A linear regression model and an artificial neural network model have been trained using conventional well logs obtained from the Volve oil field in the Norwegian North Sea then the prediction accuracy of the two models have been tested using several cases from the Eagle Ford and the Midland basins. The testing results show that the inferred P-wave travel time yields a root mean square error range of 1.5 μs/ft-6.7 μs/ft indicating a good agreement with the actual sonic log measurements. Eventually, the findings of this study are essential in optimizing the design of drilling and well completion by providing accurately estimated geomechanical properties when the actual sonic logs are unavailable.\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCompressional wave, P-wave, transit time (DTC) is critical in estimating rock mechanical properties when the subsurface cores are unavailable due to financial and operational constraints on core retrieval. For many subsurface engineering applications, including drilling and well stimulation, geomechanical properties are important in understanding subsurface deformations to prevent hazards and enhance the recovery of resources. Wyllie et al. (1956) measured DTC with dry core samples, saturated core samples of several fluids, and hence developed an empirical equation to estimate the formation porosity. Nielsen et al. (1979) utilized the acoustic travel times to estimate rock mechanical properties including Poisson’s ratio and dynamic shear moduli.\nFurthermore, the interpreted geomechanical properties (e.g., Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus) of the subsurface formations from the DTC could help improve the prediction of the in-situ stress conditions. Eaton (1975) estimated pore pressure by comparing the compressional transit time well logs to its normal trend. Others have also analytically derived the in-situ stresses from the interpreted mechanical properties (Blanton et al., 1999).\n",

        "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays an important role in medical diagnosis and treatment; different modalities of MR images can provide rich and complementary information to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. However, due to the limitations of scanning time and medical conditions, certain modalities of MR may be unavailable or of low quality in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a new multimodal MR image synthesis network to generate missing MR images. The proposed model comprises three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and image generation. During feature extraction, 2D and 3D self-supervised pretext tasks are introduced to pre-train the backbone for better representations of each modality. Then, a channel attention mechanism is used when fusing features so that the network can adaptively weigh different fusion operations to learn common representations of all modalities. Finally, a generative adversarial network is considered as the basic framework to generate images, in which a feature-level edge information loss is combined with the pixel-wise loss to ensure consistency between the synthesized and real images in terms of anatomical characteristics. 2D and 3D self-supervised pre-training can have better performance on feature extraction to retain more details in the synthetic images. Moreover, the proposed multimodal attention feature fusion block (MAFFB) in the well-designed layer-wise fusion strategy can model both common and unique information in all modalities, consistent with the clinical analysis. We also perform an interpretability analysis to confirm the rationality and effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can be applied in both single-modal and multimodal synthesis with high robustness and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches objectively and subjectively.",

        "abstract": "Computational pathology is revolutionizing the field of pathology by integrating advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies into diagnostic workflows. It offers unprecedented opportunities for improved efficiency in treatment decisions by allowing pathologists to achieve higher precision and objectivity in disease classification, tumor microenvironment description and identification of new biomarkers. However, the potential of computational pathology in personalized medicine comes with significant challenges, particularly in annotating whole slide images (WSI), which is time-consuming, costly and subject to inter-observer variability. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to learn representations from histology patches and leverage large volumes of unlabelled WSI. Recently, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) as a SSL framework has emerged and is now considered to outperform purely contrastive learning paradigms. In this work, we therefore explore the application of MIM to histology using iBOT, a self-supervised transformer-based framework. Through a wide range of 17 downstream tasks over seven cancer indications, both at the slide and patch levels, we provide recommendations on the pre-training of large models for histology data using MIM. First, we demonstrate that in-domain pre-training with iBOT outperforms both ImageNet pre-training and a model pre-trained with a purely contrastive learning objective, MoCo v2. Second, we show that Vision Transformers (ViT) models, when scaled appropriately, have the capability to learn pan-cancer representations that benefit a large variety of downstream tasks. Finally, our iBOT ViT-Base model (80 million parameters), pre-trained on more than 40 million histology images from 16 different cancer types, achieves state-of-the-art performance in most weakly-supervised WSI classification tasks compared to other SSL frameworks available in the literature. This paves the way for the development of a foundation model for histopathology. Our code, models and features are publicly available athttps://github.com/owkin/HistoSSLscaling.",

        "abstract": "In cancer diagnostics, a considerable amount of data is acquired during routine work-up. Recently, machine learning has been used to build classifiers that are tasked with cancer detection and aid in clinical decision-making. Most of these classifiers are based on supervised learning (SL) that needs time- and cost-intensive manual labeling of samples by medical experts for model training. Semi-supervised learning (SSL), however, works with only a fraction of labeled data by including unlabeled samples for information abstraction and thus can utilize the vast discrepancy between available labeled data and overall available data in cancer diagnostics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of essential functionalities and assumptions of SSL and survey key studies with regard to cancer care differentiating between image-based and non-image-based applications. We highlight current state-of-the-art models in histopathology, radiology and radiotherapy, as well as genomics. Further, we discuss potential pitfalls in SSL study design such as discrepancies in data distributions and comparison to baseline SL models, and point out future directions for SSL in oncology. We believe well-designed SSL models to strongly contribute to computer-guided diagnostics in malignant disease by overcoming current hinderances in the form of sparse labeled and abundant unlabeled data.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nSelecting and prioritizing candidate disease genes is necessary before conducting laboratory studies as identifying disease genes from a large number of candidate genes using laboratory methods, is a very costly and time-consuming task. There are many machine learning-based gene prioritization methods. These methods differ in various aspects including the feature vectors of genes, the used datasets with different structures, and the learning model. Creating a suitable feature vector for genes and an appropriate learning model on a variety of data with different and non-Euclidean structures, including graphs, as well as the lack of negative data are very important challenges of these methods. The use of graph neural networks has recently emerged in machine learning and other related fields, and they have demonstrated superior performance for a broad range of problems.\n\nMethods\nIn this study, a new semi-supervised learning method based on graph convolutional networks is presented using the novel constructing feature vector for each gene. In the proposed method, first, we construct three feature vectors for each gene using terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. Then, we train a graph convolution network on these vectors using protein–protein interaction (PPI) network data to identify disease candidate genes. Our model discovers hidden layer representations encoding in both local graph structure as well as features of nodes. This method is characterized by the simultaneous consideration of topological information of the biological network (e.g., PPI) and other sources of evidence. Finally, a validation has been done to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.\n\nResults\nSeveral experiments are performed on 16 diseases to evaluate the proposed method's performance. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the best results, in terms of precision, the area under the ROC curve (AUCs), and F1-score values, when compared with eight state-of-the-art network and machine learning-based disease gene prioritization methods.\n\nConclusion\nThis study shows that the proposed semi-supervised learning method appropriately classifies and ranks candidate disease genes using a graph convolutional network and an innovative method to create three feature vectors for genes based on the molecular function, cellular component, and biological process terms from GO data.\n",

Such malicious and unethical practices may cause identity theft and monitory loss to the people across the world. In this research paper, our effort is to identify the best Supervised Machine Learning algorithm that helps in classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions under credit card fraud on an imbalanced dataset. To conduct this research and compare the results, we have used five different Supervised Machine Learning Classification techniques. On implementing these machine learning techniques, it has been observed that both Supervised Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier perform better for detecting credit card fraud in an imbalanced dataset.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTMetagenomic binning is the step in building metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) when sequences predicted to originate from the same genome are automatically grouped together. The most widely-used methods for binning are reference-independent, operating de novo and allow the recovery of genomes from previously unsampled clades. However, they do not leverage the knowledge in existing databases. Here, we propose SemiBin, an open source tool that uses neural networks to implement a semi-supervised approach, i.e. SemiBin exploits the information in reference genomes, while retaining the capability of binning genomes that are outside the reference dataset. SemiBin outperforms existing state-of-the-art binning methods in simulated and real microbiome datasets across three different environments (human gut, dog gut, and marine microbiomes). SemiBin returns more high-quality bins with larger taxonomic diversity, including more distinct genera and species. SemiBin is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/.",

        "abstract": "Detecting construction equipment and classifying their activities are important steps for evaluating their performance and productivity on construction sites. To this end, many automated activity monitoring frameworks based on computer vision have been developed. However, most of the current state-of-the-art activity recognition methods for construction equipment are based on supervised deep learning methods. A major drawback of these approaches is that large, annotated datasets are required for each equipment and activity. To address this problem, this work adapts and customizes the self-supervised, spatiotemporal contrastive video representation learning method for excavator activity recognition. Self-supervised methods use the spatiotemporal information present in video frames as a source of information for pre-training a deep neural network without labels, which is then fine-tuned using a few labeled data. The results show the potential of this method, obtaining the recognition accuracy of 84.6% while using only 10% of the labeled data in an available dataset.",

In the existing solutions, most of the methods rely on paired images, that is, the rain image and the real image without rain in the same scene. However, in many cases, the paired images are difficult to obtain, which makes it impossible to apply the raindrop removal network in many scenarios. Therefore this article proposes a semi-supervised rain-removing network apply to unpaired images. The model contains two parts: a supervised network and an unsupervised network. After the model is trained, the unsupervised network does not require paired images and it can get a clean image without raindrops. In particular, our network can perform training on paired and unpaired samples. The experimental results show that the best results are achieved not only on the supervised rain-removing network, but also on the unsupervised rain-removing network.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPURPOSEAlzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that progressively deteriorates memory and cognitive abilities. PET 18F-AV45 (florbetapir) is a common imaging modality used to characterize the distribution of beta-amyloid deposits in the brain, however interpretation may be subjective and the misdiagnosis rate of AD ranges from 12-23%. Automated algorithms for PET 18F-AV45 interpretation including those derived from deep learning may facilitate more objective and accurate AD diagnosis.MATERIALS & METHODSA total of 1232 PET AV45 scans (207 - AD; 1025 - normal) were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A semi-supervised deep learning framework was developed to differentiate AD and normal patients. The framework consists of an autoencoder (AE), a contrastive learning loss, and a categorical classification head. A contrastive learning paradigm is used to improve the discriminative properties of latent feature vectors in multidimensional space.RESULTSUpon five-fold cross-validation, the best-performing semi-supervised contrastive model achieved validation accuracy of 82% to 86%. Secondary analysis included visualization of intermediate activations, classification report verification, and principal component analysis (PCA) of latent feature vectors. The training process yielded optimal converging losses for all three loss frameworks.CONCLUSIONA deep learning model can accurately diagnose AD using PET 18F-AV45 scans. Such models require large amounts of labeled data during training. The use of a semi-supervised contrastive learning objective and AE regularizer helps to improve model performance, especially when dataset sizes are constrained. Latent representations extracted by the model are visually clustered strongly with the addition of a contrastive learning mechanism.Summary StatementA semi-supervised contrastive learning deep learning system optimizes latent feature vector representations and yields strong model classification performance for larger data distributions within the Alzheimer’s Disease diagnostics domain.Key PointsA common diagnostic procedure used by trained radiologists in the clinical setting is the visual analysis of PET 18F-AV45 neuroimaging scans to diagnose the different stages of Alzheimer’s Disease in a patient.Contrastive learning is a strategy that allows for the optimization of latent feature representations in multidimensional space through the use of a loss function that maximizes the distance between feature vectors of different classes and minimizes the distance of feature vectors of the same class.A semi-supervised contrastive learning approach can lead to improved performance and generalization of deep learning models optimized using small training datasets as encountered in Alzheimer’s Disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTPicking particles of biological macromolecules from their cryo-electron tomograms is critical to solving their 3D structuresin situ. To reach sub-nanometre resolution, large numbers of particles often need to be picked, a laborious and time-consuming task if performed manually. To date, however, the adoption of automated particle-picking methods remains limited because of the limitations in their accuracy, processing speed and, for those based on learning models, manual annotation cost. To overcome the limitations, we develop DeepETPicker, a deep learning model for fast and accurate picking of 3D particles from cryo-electron tomograms. The training of DeepETPicker requires only weak supervision with low numbers of simplified Gaussian-type labels, reducing the burden of manual annotation of tomograms under very low signal-to-noise ratios. The simplified labels combined with the customized and lightweight model architecture of DeepETPicker as well as GPU-accelerated pooling enable substantially improved accuracy and accelerated processing speed. When tested on simulated as well as real tomograms, DeepETPicker outperforms the competing state-of-the-art methods by achieving the highest overall accuracy and speed, which translate into better quality of picked particles and higher resolutions of final reconstruction maps. DeepETPicker is provided in open source with a user-friendly interface to support automated particle picking for high-resolution cryo-electron tomographyin situ.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSo far we have discussed unsupervised learning, the inference of the underlying statistical structure (and adequate representations) of a set of data. Another fundamental field of application of machine learning is supervised learning, which is the task of learning an input-output relationship. Supervised learning assumes the existence of a function that associates a label, e.g. dog or cat, to each data point, e.g. an image. In practice, the machine tries to learn this function from a limited set of input-output examples. At the end of learning, one should be able to predict the right class for any input, not necessarily belonging to the data set: does this new image correspond to a dog or to a cat? In this chapter, we address two questions: How can supervised learning and classification be done in practice? How many data does one need to generalise, i.e. to avoid overfitting the examples? We will start by discussing perceptrons, also called support vector machines (SVM), which are neural networks with no hidden layer and have set the state of the art in classification for decades, and we will then turn to more complex neural networks.",

Its major constituents are PM2.5, PM10 and the harmful green house gases S02, N02, C0 and other effluents from vehicles and factories affecting not only humans but also other living organisms both on land and sea. The only effective solution to this global issue is to implement machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI (Air Quality Index ) that can make the people aware of the condition of the air of a certain region such that certain actions could be issued by the government for the improvement of the air quality in the future. The prime objective behind this project is to predict the AQI based on the concentration of PM2.5, PM10,S02, N02, C0 as well as weather conditions like temperature, pressure and humidity[2].Hence the data set is combined from various web sources like cpcb.nic.in and uci repository in order to bring accuracy in the prediction and to justify whether the Quality of air is suitable or not. This prediction will be brought about with the help of some supervised machine learning algorithms and the observation and the result will state which algorithm is giving better accuracy in prediction of AQI and which one is giving less error.</p>",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe visual system of mammals is comprised of parallel, hierarchical specialized pathways. Different pathways are specialized in so far as they use representations that are more suitable for supporting specific downstream behaviours. In particular, the clearest example is the specialization of the ventral (“what”) and dorsal (“where”) pathways of the visual cortex. These two pathways support behaviours related to visual recognition and movement, respectively. To-date, deep neural networks have mostly been used as models of the ventral, recognition pathway. However, it is unknown whether both pathways can be modelled with a single deep ANN. Here, we ask whether a single model with a single loss function can capture the properties of both the ventral and the dorsal pathways. We explore this question using data from mice, who like other mammals, have specialized pathways that appear to support recognition and movement behaviours. We show that when we train a deep neural network architecture with two parallel pathways using a self-supervised predictive loss function, we can outperform other models in fitting mouse visual cortex. Moreover, we can model both the dorsal and ventral pathways. These results demonstrate that a self-supervised predictive learning approach applied to parallel pathway architectures can account for some of the functional specialization seen in mammalian visual systems.",

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the Deep Learning techniques which have captured lots of attention as far as real world applications are considered. It is nothing but the multilayer architecture with hidden computational power which detects features itself. It doesn't require any handcrafted features. The remarkable increase in the computational power of Convolutional Neural Network is due to the use of Graphics processor units, parallel computing, also the availability of large amount of data in various variety forms. This paper gives the broad view of various supervised Convolutional Neural Network applications with its salient features in the fields, mainly Computer vision for Pattern and Object Detection, Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, Medical image analysis.

However, the current metallographic examination method to find the parameter window is time-consuming and involves subjective assessments of the experimenters. Here, we proposed a supervised machine learning (ML) method to detect the track defect and predict the printability of material in SLM intelligently. The printed tracks were classified into five types based on the measured surface morphologies and characteristics. The classification results were used as the target output of the ML model. Four indicators had been calculated to evaluate the quality of the tracks quantitatively, serving as input variables of the model. The data-driven model can determine the defect-free process parameter combination, which significantly improves the efficiency in searching the process parameter window and has great potential for the application in the unmanned factory in the future.",

In addition, PV module faults can create risks to personnel safety and fire hazards if they are not detected quickly. As IoT hardware capabilities increase and machine learning frameworks mature, better fault detection performance may be possible using low-cost sensors running machine learning (ML) models that monitor electrical and thermal parameters at an individual module level. In this paper, to evaluate the performance of ML models that are suitable for embedding in low-cost hardware at the module level, eight different PV module faults and their impacts on PV module output are discussed based on a literature review and simulation. The faults are emulated and applied to a real PV system, allowing the collection and labelling of panel-level measurement data. Then, different ML methods are used to classify these faults in comparison to the normal condition. Results confirm that NN obtain 93% classification accuracy for seven selected classes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAutomated tuning of gate-defined quantum dots is a requirement for large-scale semiconductor-based qubit initialisation. An essential step of these tuning procedures is charge-state detection based on charge stability diagrams. Using supervised machine learning to perform this task requires a large dataset for models to train on. In order to avoid hand labelling experimental data, synthetic data has been explored as an alternative. While providing a significant increase in the size of the training dataset compared to using experimental data, using synthetic data means that classifiers are trained on data sourced from a different distribution than the experimental data that is part of the tuning process. Here we evaluate the prediction accuracy of a range of machine learning models trained on simulated and experimental data, and their ability to generalise to experimental charge stability diagrams in two-dimensional electron gas and nanowire devices. We find that classifiers perform best on either purely experimental or a combination of synthetic and experimental training data, and that adding common experimental noise signatures to the synthetic data does not dramatically improve the classification accuracy. These results suggest that experimental training data as well as realistic quantum dot simulations and noise models are essential in charge-state detection using supervised machine learning.",

The various stimuli, which are </em><em>Sensitization</em><em> and </em><em>Inflammatory</em><em> are different   for each patient and it also could lead to asthma attack on different severity degrees. Information and knowledge regarding the cause factors of asthma is very important for patient, so they could have a better control of their asthma triggers and health conditions.  In this paper, we developed a personalized asthma management system by using semi-supervised learning technique.  The main methodology is to find pattern from patient daily information, then system will extract rules regarding their asthma trigger and classify them to each of asthma severity degrees. There is a dashboard that contain all the factors noted by the patient and evaluation of their asthma management. The result of experiment evaluation shown that the proposed system have 80% of accuracy, which proves that system reliable for a better asthma self-management.</em></p><p><em><strong>Keywords</strong></em><em>: </em><em>asthma management,semi- supervised learning, dashboard system</em></p><p><em>Penyakit asma adalah penyakit radang </em><em>kronis </em><em>pada paru-paru yang bereaksi pada berbagai rangsangan yang terdapat pada tubuh penderitanya.

        "abstract": "The task of webly-supervised fine-grained recognition is to boost recognition accuracy of classifying subordinate categories (e.g., different bird species) by utilizing freely available but noisy web data. As the label noises significantly hurt the network training, it is desirable to distinguish and eliminate noisy images. In this paper, we propose two strategies, i.e., open-set noise removal and closed-set noise correction, to both remove such two kinds of web noises w.r.t. fine-grained recognition. Specifically, for open-set noise removal, we utilize a pre-trained deep model to perform deep descriptor transformation to estimate the positive correlation between these web images, and detect the open-set noises based on the correlation values. Regarding closed-set noise correction, we develop a top-k recall optimization loss for firstly assigning a label set towards each web image to reduce the impact of hard label assignment for closed-set noises. Then, we further propose to correct the sample with its label set as the true single label from a partial label learning perspective. Experiments on several webly-supervised fine-grained benchmark datasets show that our method obviously outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "For the task of monocular depth estimation, self-supervised learning supervises training by calculating the pixel difference between the target image and the warped reference image, obtaining results comparable to those with full supervision. However, the problematic pixels in low-texture regions are ignored, since most researchers think that no pixels violate the assumption of camera motion, taking stereo pairs as the input in self-supervised learning, which leads to the optimization problem in these regions. To tackle this problem, we perform photometric loss using the lowest-level feature maps instead and implement first- and second-order smoothing to the depth, ensuring consistent gradients ring optimization. Given the shortcomings of ResNet as the backbone, we propose a new depth estimation network architecture to improve edge location accuracy and obtain clear outline information even in smoothed low-texture boundaries. To acquire more stable and reliable quantitative evaluation results, we introce a virtual data set in the self-supervised task because these have dense depth maps corresponding to pixel by pixel. We achieve performance that exceeds that of the prior methods on both the Eigen Splits of the KITTI and VKITTI2 data sets taking stereo pairs as the input.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundIdentifying human protein-phenotype relationships has attracted researchers in bioinformatics and biomedical natural language processing due to its importance in uncovering rare and complex diseases. Since experimental validation of protein-phenotype associations is prohibitive, automated tools capable of accurately extracting these associations from the biomedical text are in high demand. However, while the manual annotation of protein-phenotype co-mentions required for training such models is highly resource-consuming, extracting millions of unlabeled co-mentions is straightforward.ResultsIn this study, we propose a novel deep semi-supervised ensemble framework that combines deep neural networks, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning for classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions with the help of unlabeled data. This framework allows the ability to incorporate an extensive collection of unlabeled sentence-level co-mentions of human proteins and phenotypes with a small labeled dataset to enhance overall performance. We develop PPPredSS, a prototype of our proposed semi-supervised framework that combines sophisticated language models, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a new state-of-the-art performance in classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions by outperforming other supervised and semi-supervised counterparts. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of PPPredSS in powering a curation assistant system through case studies involving a group of biologists.ConclusionsThis article presents a novel approach for human protein-phenotype co-mention classification based on deep, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning. The insights and findings from this work have implications for biomedical researchers, biocurators, and the text mining community working on biomedical relationship extraction.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining and rehabilitating pavement in a timely manner is essential for preserving or improving its condition, with roughness being a critical factor. Accurate prediction of road roughness is a vital component of sustainable transportation because it helps transportation planners to develop cost-effective and sustainable pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. Traditional statistical methods can be less effective for this purpose due to their inherent assumptions, rendering them inaccurate. Therefore, this study employed explainable and supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the International Roughness Index (IRI) of asphalt concrete pavement in Sri Lankan arterial roads from 2013 to 2018. Two predictor variables, pavement age and cumulative traffic volume, were used in this study. Five machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), were utilized and compared with the statistical model. The study findings revealed that the machine learning algorithms’ predictions were superior to those of the regression model, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of more than 0.75, except for SVM. Moreover, RF provided the best prediction among the five machine learning algorithms due to its extrapolation and global optimization capabilities. Further, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that both explanatory variables had positive impacts on IRI progression, with pavement age having the most significant effect. Providing accurate explanations for the decision-making processes in black box models using SHAP analysis increases the trust of road users and domain experts in the predictions generated by machine learning models. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the use of explainable AI-based methods was more effective than traditional regression analysis in IRI prediction. Overall, using this approach, road authorities can plan for timely maintenance to avoid costly and extensive rehabilitation. Therefore, sustainable transportation can be promoted by extending pavement life and reducing frequent reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY\nPolar regions and Greenland in particular are highly sensitive to global warming. Impacts on Greenland’s glaciers may be observed through the increasing number of calving events. However, a direct assessment of the calving activity is limited due to the remoteness of polar regions and the cloudy weather which makes impossible a recurrent observation through satellite imagery. To tackle this issue, we exploit the seismological network deployed in Greenland which actively records seismic signals associated with calving events, hereinafter referred to as glacial earthquakes. These seismic signals present a broad frequency range and a wide diversity of waveform which make them difficult to discriminate from tectonic events as well as anthropogenic and natural noises. In this study, we start from two catalogues of known events, one for glacial earthquake events which occurred between 1993 and 2013 and one for earthquakes which occurred in the same time period, and we implement a detection algorithm based on the STA/LTA method to extract signals’ events from continuous data. Then, we train and test a machine learning processing chain based on the Random Forest algorithm which allows us to automatically associate the events respectively with calving and tectonic activity, with a certain probability. Finally, we investigate 844 selected days spanning time of continuous data from the Greenland regional seismic network which results in a new, more exhaustive, catalogue of glacial earthquakes expanded of 1633 newly detected glacial events. Moreover, we extensively discuss the choice of the features used to describe glacial earthquakes, in particular the 39 new features created in this study which have drastically improved our results with 7 of the 10 best features being in the added set. The perspective of further expansion of the glacial earthquake catalogue applying the processing chain discussed in this paper on different time spans highlights how combining seismology and machine learning can increase our understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution of calving activity in remote regions.",

        "abstract": "Most recent semi-supervised deep learning (deep SSL) methods used a similar paradigm: use network predictions to update pseudo-labels and use pseudo-labels to update network parameters iteratively. However, they lack theoretical support and cannot explain why predictions are good candidates for pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a principled end-to-end framework named deep decipher (D2) for SSL. Within the D2 framework, we prove that pseudo-labels are related to network predictions by an exponential link function, which gives a theoretical support for using predictions as pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that updating pseudo-labels by network predictions will make them uncertain. To mitigate this problem, we propose a training strategy called repetitive reprediction (R2). Finally, the proposed R2-D2 method is tested on the large-scale ImageNet dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5 percentage points.",

        "abstract": "In general, one may have access to a handful of labeled normal and defect datasets. Most unlabeled datasets contain normal samples because the defect samples occurred rarely. Thus, the majority of approaches for anomaly detection are formed as unsupervised problems. Most of the previous methods have typically chosen an autoencoder to extract the common characteristics of the unlabeled dataset, assumed as normal characteristics, and determine the unsuccessfully reconstructed area as the defect area in an image. However, we could waste the ground truth data if we leave them unused. In addition, a suitable choice of threshold value is needed for anomaly segmentation. In our study, we propose a semi-supervised setting to make use of both unlabeled and labeled samples and the network is trained to segment out defect regions automatically. We first train an autoencoder network to reconstruct defect-free images from an unlabeled dataset, mostly containing normal samples. Then, a difference map between the input and the reconstructed image is calculated and feeds along with the corresponding input image into the subsequent segmentation module. We share the ground truth for both kinds of input and train the network with binary cross-entropy loss. Additional difference images can also increase stability during training. Finally, we show extensive experimental results to prove that, with help from a handful of ground-truth segmentation maps, the result is improved overall by 3.83%.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe rising sea levels due to climate change are a significant concern, particularly for vulnerable, low-lying coastal regions like the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical sea level variability, and the influencing factors, and develop a reliable modeling system for future projections. This knowledge is essential for informed planning and mitigation strategies aimed at protecting coastal communities and ecosystems. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of mean sea level anomaly (MSLA) trends in the GoG between 1993 and 2020, covering three distinct periods (1993–2002, 2003–2012, and 2013–2020). It investigates the connections between interannual sea level variability and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric forcings. Furthermore, the study evaluates the performance of supervised machine learning techniques to optimize sea level modeling. The findings reveal a consistent rise in MSLA linear trends across the basin, particularly pronounced in the northern region, with a total linear trend of 88 mm over the entire period. The highest decadal trend (38.7 mm) emerged during 2013–2020, with the most substantial percentage increment (100%) occurring in 2003–2012. Spatial variation in decadal sea-level trends was influenced by subbasin physical forcings. Strong interannual signals in the spatial sea level distribution were identified, linked to large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Seasonal variations in sea level trends are attributed to seasonal changes in the forcing factors. The evaluation of supervised learning modeling methods indicates that Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Machines are the most accurate, reproducing interannual sea level patterns in the GoG with 97% and 96% accuracy. These models could be used to derive regional sea level projections via downscaling of climate models. These findings provide essential insights for effective coastal management and climate adaptation strategies in the GoG.",

Our method simultaneously considers intra- and inter-video representation associations for reliable correspondence estimation. The intra-video learning transforms the image contents across frames within a single video via the frame pair-wise affinity. To obtain the discriminative representation for instance-level separation, we go beyond the intra-video analysis and construct the inter-video affinity to facilitate the contrastive transformation across different videos. By forcing the transformation consistency between intra- and inter-video levels, the fine-grained correspondence associations are well preserved and the instance-level feature discrimination is effectively reinforced. Our simple framework outperforms the recent self-supervised correspondence methods on a range of visual tasks including video object tracking (VOT), video object segmentation (VOS), pose keypoint tracking, etc. It is worth mentioning that our method also surpasses the fully-supervised affinity representation (e.g., ResNet) and performs competitively against the recent fully-supervised algorithms designed for the specific tasks (e.g., VOT and VOS).",

        "abstract": "Driven by the urgent demand for flood monitoring, water resource management and environmental protection, water-body detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted increasing research attention. Deep semantic segmentation networks (DSSNs) have gradually become the mainstream technology used for remote sensing image water-body detection, but two vital problems remain. One problem is that the traditional structure of DSSNs does not consider multiscale and multishape characteristics of water bodies. Another problem is that a large amount of unlabeled data is not fully utilized during the training process, but the unlabeled data often contain meaningful supervision information. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale residual network (MSResNet) that uses self-supervised learning (SSL) for water-body detection. More specifically, our well-designed MSResNet distinguishes water bodies with different scales and shapes and helps retain the detailed boundaries of water bodies. In addition, the optimization of MSResNet with our SSL strategy can improve the stability and universality of the method, and the presented SSL approach can be flexibly extended to practical applications. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets, including the 2020 Gaofen Challenge water-body segmentation dataset and the GID dataset, demonstrate that our MSResNet can obviously outperform state-of-the-art deep learning backbones and that our SSL strategy can further improve the water-body detection performance.",

        "abstract": "Water makes up about 70% of the earth’s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.",

        "abstract": "Cross-dipole sonic data have been widely accepted in the industry to characterize shear slowness measurements using borehole flexural modes. The borehole flexural mode is dispersive and sensitive to many factors such as tool structure, borehole shape, drilling fluid and formation properties. These sensitivities further enable us to characterize anisotropy, drilling features, and logging conditions. From wide-frequency-band dispersions, one can evaluate the cross-dipole dispersions to identify zones with intrinsic anisotropy, stress-induced anisotropy, or fracture-induced anisotropy. One can also check the dispersions to identify drilling features such as break-out and gas leak, and logging conditions such as tool decentralization. A good understanding of dispersion types is an essential step to guide petrophysical and geomechanical applications. Traditionally, the classification is often carried out manually through visual inspection on a depth-by-depth basis. This is mainly because the dispersion data are represented by scattered and noisy points. Consequently, such a process is time-consuming and requires  knowledge on sonic dispersion signatures.  To automate sonic data classification, we have developed an algorithm using a supervised machine-learning approach. A neural network classifier was trained using a large volume of synthetic dispersions. The training data are generated using randomly sampled input physical parameters covering effective borehole ovality model, anisotropic model and an alteration model for near wellbore concentration effects. The training datasets are labeled with these physical models. Excellent accuracy was achieved with neural network training. We then applied the classifier to field prediction, where scattered dispersion points are first reconstructed as smooth curves using a recently developed automatic dispersion interpretation algorithm. We tested the new algorithm to real field data where we observe different formation types that are dominant. The testing results show that the developed workflow is accurate in predicting dispersion types with noisy data, and efficient in handling large volume wells.  The machine-learning based workflow provides a more natural way for classification than a criteria-based algorithm, thanks to the rich physical information brought by training datasets. The outputs of the classification give ‘soft flags’ in the sense they are represented by prediction probabilities between 0 to 1 using the concept of entropy, which further enable us to evaluate co-existing dispersion signatures. This workflow serves as a key step in the quality control of sonic data and guides further applications in geomechanics where features such as stresses, intrinsic anisotropy and breakouts are key inputs. This paper will describe the methodology, including the construction of the training library, and illustrate the classification with several field examples.",

        "abstract": "\n      \n        Dictionary learning has played an important role in the success of sparse representation, which triggers the rapid developments of unsupervised and supervised dictionary learning methods. However, in most practical applications, there are usually quite limited labeled training samples while it is relatively easy to acquire abundant unlabeled training samples. Thus semi-supervised dictionary learning that aims to effectively explore the discrimination of unlabeled training data has attracted much attention of researchers. Although various regularizations have been introduced in the prevailing semi-supervised dictionary learning, how to design an effective unified model of dictionary learning and unlabeled-data class estimating and how to well explore the discrimination in the labeled and unlabeled data are still open. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative semi-supervised dictionary learning model (DSSDL) by introducing discriminative representation, an identical coding of unlabeled data to the coding of testing data final classification, and an entropy regularization term. The coding strategy of unlabeled data can not only avoid the affect of its incorrect class estimation, but also make the learned discrimination be well exploited in the final classification. The introduced regularization of entropy can avoid overemphasizing on some uncertain estimated classes for unlabeled samples. Apart from the enhanced discrimination in the learned dictionary by the discriminative representation, an extended dictionary is used to mainly explore the discrimination embedded in the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on face recognition, digit recognition and texture classification show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "In the fields of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, attack and anomaly detection are rising concerns. With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing proportionally. In this paper the performances of several machine learning algorithms in identifying cyber-attacks (namely SYN-DOS attacks) to IoT systems are compared both in terms of application performances, and in training/application times. We use supervised machine learning algorithms included in the MLlib library of Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for big data processing. We show the implementation details and the performance of those algorithms on public datasets using a training set of up to 2 million instances. We adopt a Cloud environment, emphasizing the importance of the scalability and of the elasticity of use. Results show that all the Spark algorithms used result in a very good identification accuracy (>99%). Overall, one of them, Random Forest, achieves an accuracy of 1. We also report a very short training time (23.22 sec for Decision Tree with 2 million rows). The experiments also show a very low application time (0.13 sec for over than 600,000 instances for Random Forest) using Apache Spark in the Cloud. Furthermore, the explicit model generated by Random Forest is very easy-to-implement using high- or low-level programming languages. In light of the results obtained, both in terms of computation times and identification performance, a hybrid approach for the detection of SYN-DOS cyber-attacks on IoT devices is proposed: the application of an explicit Random Forest model, implemented directly on the IoT device, along with a second level analysis (training) performed in the Cloud.",

However, we argue that without carefully designed augmentation techniques, augmentations on graphs may behave arbitrarily in that the underlying semantics of graphs can drastically change. As a consequence, the performance of existing augmentation-based methods is highly dependent on the choice of augmentation scheme, i.e., augmentation hyperparameters and combinations of augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation-free self-supervised learning framework for graphs, named AFGRL. Specifically, we generate an alternative view of a graph by discovering nodes that share the local structural information and the global semantics with the graph. Extensive experiments towards various node-level tasks, i.e., node classification, clustering, and similarity search on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AFGRL.

        "abstract": "Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an extensively implemented arc welding process through the control of input process parameters and the metal from the filler wire. Despite its popular use in various industries, the complex interrelationship between the actual bead and the varying welding parameters makes it challenging to predict appropriate bead geometries via mathematical modeling in a continually changing welding process. In this study, the Regression Learner App was used to compare the performance of supervised Machine Learning (ML) predictive models comprising the Linear Regression (LR), Regression Tree (RT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ensembles of Tree (ET), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using GMAW dataset. The dataset was scaled and normalized at a range of -1 to +1 to facilitate the visualization of the variation effect. The wire feed speed, voltage, weld velocity, unmelted wire length, and melted wire volume were considered as the input parameters to predict the bead geometry. In addition, the five-fold cross-validation was employed to avoid overfitting and poor generalization. Finally, statistical indicators, namely the Coefficient of Determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were performed on all developed models to evaluate their performance. Thus, the fine tree and ANN models achieved the highest prediction accuracies of 88–91%, signifying their potential use in future research. In short, the present study demonstrated the performance of various supervised ML algorithms for bead geometry prediction, which would assist the selection of appropriately supervised ML algorithms in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMost existing deep learning-based sentiment classification methods need large human-annotated data, but labeling large amounts of high-quality emotional texts is labor-intensive. Users on various social platforms generate massive amounts of tagged opinionated text (e.g., tweets, customer reviews), providing a new resource for training deep models. However, some of the tagged instances have sentiment tags that are diametrically opposed to their true semantics. We cannot use this tagged data directly because the noisy labeled instances have a negative impact on the training phase. In this paper, we present a novel Simple Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning framework (SWCL). We use the contrastive learning strategy to pre-train the deep model on the large user-tagged data (referred to as weakly-labeled data) and then the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the small human-annotated data. We refine the contrastive loss function to better exploit inter-class contrastive patterns, making contrastive learning more applicable to the weakly-supervised setting. Besides, multiple sampling on different sentiment pairs reduces the negative impact of label noises. SWCL captures the diverse sentiment semantics of weakly labeled data and improves their suitability for downstream sentiment classification tasks. Our method outperforms the other baseline methods in experiments on the Amazon review, Twitter, and SST-5 datasets. Even when fine-tuned on 0.5 percent of the training data (i.e. 32 instances), our framework significantly boosts the deep models’ performance, demonstrating its robustness in a few-shot learning scenario.",

        "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges often involves machine learning algorithms, trained based on two independent learning strategies, namely unsupervised and supervised learning, depending on the type of training data available. When unsupervised learning strategy is employed, the algorithms are normally trained with data gathered from monitoring systems, corresponding to normal operational and environmental conditions. The lack of information regarding the dynamic response of the structure under extreme environmental and operational conditions, as well as under damage scenarios, may lead to flaws in the damage detection process, namely the rise of false indications of damage. In order to overcome this drawback, finite element models can be used as structural proxies to generate data that correspond to scenarios unlikely to be recorded by the monitoring systems, such as extreme temperatures or structural damage. The use of both monitoring and numerical data in the framework of a hybrid approach greatly improves the quality of the training process, as recently shown by the authors. The hybrid approach also enables the use of the supervised learning strategy if numerical data corresponding to damage scenarios are available. Therefore, this paper assesses the reliability of a hybrid approach for the supervised training of machine learning algorithms using numerical data corresponding to extreme temperatures and several damage scenarios. The damage scenarios comprise various degrees of settlement of a bridge pier and a landslide near the same pier. Monitoring data are used for the testing of the algorithms and for the initial calibration of the finite element model, which does not need to be exceedingly detailed, as the probabilistic variation of the uncertain parameters is taken into account. The procedure was applied to the Z-24 Bridge, a well-known benchmark consisting of one year of continuous monitoring and including progressive damage readings.",

Sarcasm detection in social networks SNs such as Twitter is a significant task as it has assisted in studying tweets using NLP. Many existing study-related methods have always focused only on the content-based on features in sarcastic words, leaving out the lexical-based features and context-based features knowledge in isolation. This shows a loss of the semantics of terms in a sarcastic expression. This study proposes an improved model to detect sarcasm from SNs. We used three feature set engineering: context-based on features set, Sarcastic based on features, and lexical based on features. Two Novel Algorithms for an effective model to detect sarcasm are divided into two stages. The first used two algorithms one with preprocessing, and the second algorithm with feature sets. To deal with data from SNs. We applied various supervised machine learning (ML) such as k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), na?ve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers with TF-IDF feature extraction representation data. To model evaluation metrics, evaluate sarcasm detection model performance in precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score by 100%. We achieved higher results in Lexical features with KNN 89.19 % accuracy campers to other classifiers. Combining two feature sets (Sarcastic and Lexical) has shown slight improvement with the same classifier KNN; we achieved 90.00% accuracy. When combining three feature sets (Sarcastic, Lexical, and context), the accuracy is shown slight improvement. Also, the same classifier we achieved is a 90.51% KNN classifier. We perform the model differently to see the effect of three feature sets through the experiment individual, combining two feature sets and gradually combining three feature sets. When combining all features set together, achieve the best accuracy with the KNN classifier.</p>\n\t\t</abstract>",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping a clinical AI model necessitates a significant amount of highly curated and carefully annotated dataset by multiple medical experts, which results in increased development time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a method that enables AI models to leverage unlabelled data to acquire domain-specific background knowledge that can enhance their performance on various downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce CypherViT, a cluster-based histo-pathology phenotype representation learning by self-supervised multi-class-token hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT). CypherViT is a novel backbone that can be integrated into a SSL pipeline, accommodating both coarse and fine-grained feature learning for histopathological images via a hierarchical feature agglomerative attention module with multiple classification (cls) tokens in ViT. Our qualitative analysis showcases that our approach successfully learns semantically meaningful regions of interest that align with morphological phenotypes. To validate the model, we utilize the DINO self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to train CypherViT on a substantial dataset of unlabeled breast cancer histopathological images. This trained model proves to be a generalizable and robust feature extractor for colorectal cancer images. Notably, our model demonstrates promising performance in patch-level tissue phenotyping tasks across four public datasets. The results from our quantitative experiments highlight significant advantages over existing state-of-the-art SSL models and traditional transfer learning methods, such as those relying on ImageNet pre-training.",

        "abstract": "Network infrastructures are the target of several attacks. These include intrusions into the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network. The network's availability is impacted by a persistent attack known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Such an assault is carried out using a command and control (C & C) technique. To detect these assaults, numerous researchers have put forth various machine learning-based solutions. In this paper, we are going to detect different DDoS attacks by various methods and evaluate their performance. This experiment made use of the KD99 dataset. The normal and assault samples were classified using the random forest technique. The classification of 99.76% of the samples was accurate. By strategically selecting clusters and incorporating the insights gained from the small labelled dataset, a portion of the unlabelled clusters can be assigned labels, effectively converting raw data into useful training examples. This enriched dataset is then used to train an improved classifier that can better generalize and adapt to the dynamic nature of DDoS attacks.",

        "abstract": "Detecting key frames in videos is a common problem in many applications such as video classification, action recognition and video summarization. These tasks can be performed more efficiently using only a handful of key frames rather than the full video. Existing key frame detection approaches are mostly designed for supervised learning and require manual labelling of key frames in a large corpus of training data to train the models. Labelling requires human annotators from different backgrounds to annotate key frames in videos which is not only expensive and time consuming but also prone to subjective errors and inconsistencies between the labelers. To overcome these problems, we propose an automatic self-supervised method for detecting key frames in a video. Our method comprises a two-stream ConvNet and a novel automatic annotation architecture able to reliably annotate key frames in a video for self-supervised learning of the ConvNet. The proposed ConvNet learns deep appearance and motion features to detect frames that are unique. The trained network is then able to detect key frames in test videos. Extensive experiments on UCF101 human action and video summarization VSUMM datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Current works on facial action unit (AU) recognition typically require fully AU-labeled training samples. To reduce the reliance on time-consuming manual AU annotations, we propose a novel semi-supervised AU recognition method leveraging two kinds of readily available auxiliary information. The method leverages the dependencies between AUs and expressions as well as the dependencies among AUs, which are caused by facial anatomy and therefore embedded in all facial images, independent on their AU annotation status. The other auxiliary information is facial image synthesis given AUs, the dual task of AU recognition from facial images, and therefore has intrinsic probabilistic connections with AU recognition, regardless of AU annotations. Specifically, we propose a dual semi-supervised generative adversarial network for AU recognition from partially AU-labeled and fully expressionlabeled facial images. The proposed network consists of an AU classifier C, an image generator G, and a discriminator D. In addition to minimize the supervised losses of the AU classifier and the face generator for labeled training data, we explore the probabilistic duality between the tasks using adversary learning to force the convergence of the face-AU-expression tuples generated from the AU classifier and the face generator, and the ground-truth distribution in labeled data for all training data. This joint distribution also includes the inherent AU dependencies. Furthermore, we reconstruct the facial image using the output of the AU classifier as the input of the face generator, and create AU labels by feeding the output of the face generator to the AU classifier. We minimize reconstruction losses for all training data, thus exploiting the informative feedback provided by the dual tasks. Within-database and cross-database experiments on three benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our method in both AU recognition and face synthesis compared to state-of-the-art works.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories spread through many parts of society. However, the disinformation spreading through social media is, according to the literature, one of the causes of increased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. In this context, the analysis of social media posts is particularly important, but the large amount of data exchanged on social media platforms requires specific methods. This is why machine learning and natural language processing models are increasingly applied to social media data.\n\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study is to examine the capability of the CamemBERT French-language model to faithfully predict the elaborated categories, with the knowledge that tweets about vaccination are often ambiguous, sarcastic, or irrelevant to the studied topic.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 901,908 unique French-language tweets related to vaccination published between July 12, 2021, and August 11, 2021, were extracted using Twitter’s application programming interface (version 2; Twitter Inc). Approximately 2000 randomly selected tweets were labeled with 2 types of categorizations: (1) arguments for (pros) or against (cons) vaccination (health measures included) and (2) type of content (scientific, political, social, or vaccination status). The CamemBERT model was fine-tuned and tested for the classification of French-language tweets. The model’s performance was assessed by computing the F1-score, and confusion matrices were obtained.\n\n\nResults\nThe accuracy of the applied machine learning reached up to 70.6% for the first classification (pro and con tweets) and up to 90% for the second classification (scientific and political tweets). Furthermore, a tweet was 1.86 times more likely to be incorrectly classified by the model if it contained fewer than 170 characters (odds ratio 1.86; 95% CI 1.20-2.86).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe accuracy of the model is affected by the classification chosen and the topic of the message examined. When the vaccine debate is jostled by contested political decisions, tweet content becomes so heterogeneous that the accuracy of the model drops for less differentiated classes. However, our tests showed that it is possible to improve the accuracy by selecting tweets using a new method based on tweet length.\n",

        "abstract": "SUMMARYMicroseismic methods are crucial for real-time monitoring of the hydraulic fracturing dynamic status during the development of unconventional reservoirs. However, unlike the active-source seismic events, the microseismic events usually have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes its data processing challenging. To overcome the noise issue of the weak microseismic events, we propose a new workflow for high-resolution microseismic event detection. For the preprocessing, fix-sized segmentation with a length of 2*wavelength is used to divide the data into segments. Later on, 191 features have been extracted and used as the input data to train the support vector machine (SVM) model. These features include 63 1-D time/spectral-domain features, and 128 2-D texture features, which indicate the continuity, smoothness, and irregularity of the events/noise. The proposed feature extraction maximally exploits the limited information of each segment. Afterward, we use a combination of univariate feature selection and random-forest-based recursive feature elimination for feature selection to avoid overfitting. This feature selection strategy not only finds the best features, but also decides the optimal number of features that are needed for the best accuracy. Regarding the training process, SVM with a Gaussian kernel is used. In addition, a cross-validation (CV) process is implemented for automatic parameter setting. In the end, a group of synthetic and field microseismic data with different levels of complexity show that the proposed workflow is much more robust than the state-of-the-art short-term-average over long-term-average ratio (STA/LTA) method and also performs better than the convolutional-neural-networks (CNN), for this case where the amount of training data sets is limited. A demo for the synthetic example is available: https://github.com/shanqu91/ML_event_detection_microseismic.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Single particle soot photometers (SP2) use laser-induced incandescence to detect aerosols on a single particle basis. SP2s that have been modified to provide greater spectral contrast between their narrow and broad-band incandescent detectors have previously been used to characterize both refractory black carbon (rBC) and light-absorbing metallic aerosols, including iron oxides (FeOx). However, single particles cannot be unambiguously identified from their incandescent peak height (a function of particle mass) and color ratio (a measure of blackbody temperature) alone. Machine learning offers a promising approach for improving the classification of these aerosols. Here we explore the advantages and limitations of classifying single particle signals obtained with a modified SP2 using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Laboratory samples of different aerosols that incandesce in the SP2 (fullerene soot, mineral dust, volcanic ash, coal fly ash, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4) were used to train a random forest algorithm. The trained algorithm was then applied to test data sets of laboratory samples and atmospheric aerosols. This method provides a systematic approach for classifying incandescent aerosols by providing a score, or conditional probability, that a particle is likely to belong to a particular aerosol class (rBC, FeOx, etc.) given its observed single particle features. We consider two alternative approaches for identifying aerosols in mixed populations based on their single particle SP2 response: one with specific class labels for each species sampled, and one with three broader classes (rBC, anthropogenic FeOx, and dust-like) for particles with similar SP2 responses. Predictions of the most likely particle class (the one with the highest mean probability) based on applying the trained random forest algorithm to the single particle features for test data sets comprising examples of each class are compared with the true class for those particles to estimate generalization performance. While the specific class approach performed well for rBC and Fe3O4 (≥99 % of these aerosols are correctly identified), its classification of other aerosol types is significantly worse (only 47 %–66 % of other particles are correctly identified). Using the broader class approach, we find a classification accuracy of 99 % for FeOx samples measured in the laboratory. The method allows for classification of FeOx as anthropogenic or dust-like for aerosols with effective spherical diameters from 170 to >1200 nm. The misidentification of both dust-like aerosols and rBC as anthropogenic FeOx is small, with <3 % of the dust-like aerosols and <0.1 % of rBC misidentified as FeOx for the broader class case. When applying this method to atmospheric observations taken in Boulder, CO, a clear mode consistent with FeOx was observed, distinct from dust-like aerosols.\n                    ",

The CNN features obtained from multiple spectral bands are fused at the initial layers of deep neural networks as opposed to final layers. The early fusion architecture has fewer parameters and thereby reduces the computational time and GPU memory during training and inference. We also propose a composite fusion architecture that fuses features throughout the network. The methods were validated on four different datasets: ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, IEEE Zeebruges and Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 dataset. For the Sentinel-1,-2 datasets, we obtain the ground truth labels for three classes from OpenStreetMap. Results on all the images show early fusion, specifically after layer three of the network, achieves results similar to or better than a decision level fusion mechanism. The performance of the proposed architecture is also on par with the state-of-the-art results.",

Total of 25000 tweets were processed, analyzed and predicted the output as positive, negative, or neutral using those models. This research would help to understand which models should be used and followed and which model would yield higher accuracy while using various approaches of data preprocessing and parameters tuning.

However, they lack theoretical support and cannot explain why predictions are good candidates for pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a principled end-to-end framework named deep decipher (D2) for SSL. Within the D2 framework, we prove that pseudo-labels are related to network predictions by an exponential link function, which gives a theoretical support for using predictions as pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that updating pseudo-labels by network predictions will make them uncertain. To mitigate this problem, we propose a training strategy called repetitive reprediction (R2). Finally, the proposed R2-D2 method is tested on the large-scale ImageNet dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5 percentage points.",

        "abstract": "In general, one may have access to a handful of labeled normal and defect datasets. Most unlabeled datasets contain normal samples because the defect samples occurred rarely. Thus, the majority of approaches for anomaly detection are formed as unsupervised problems. Most of the previous methods have typically chosen an autoencoder to extract the common characteristics of the unlabeled dataset, assumed as normal characteristics, and determine the unsuccessfully reconstructed area as the defect area in an image. However, we could waste the ground truth data if we leave them unused. In addition, a suitable choice of threshold value is needed for anomaly segmentation. In our study, we propose a semi-supervised setting to make use of both unlabeled and labeled samples and the network is trained to segment out defect regions automatically. We first train an autoencoder network to reconstruct defect-free images from an unlabeled dataset, mostly containing normal samples. Then, a difference map between the input and the reconstructed image is calculated and feeds along with the corresponding input image into the subsequent segmentation module. We share the ground truth for both kinds of input and train the network with binary cross-entropy loss. Additional difference images can also increase stability during training. Finally, we show extensive experimental results to prove that, with help from a handful of ground-truth segmentation maps, the result is improved overall by 3.83%.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe rising sea levels due to climate change are a significant concern, particularly for vulnerable, low-lying coastal regions like the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical sea level variability, and the influencing factors, and develop a reliable modeling system for future projections. This knowledge is essential for informed planning and mitigation strategies aimed at protecting coastal communities and ecosystems. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of mean sea level anomaly (MSLA) trends in the GoG between 1993 and 2020, covering three distinct periods (1993–2002, 2003–2012, and 2013–2020). It investigates the connections between interannual sea level variability and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric forcings. Furthermore, the study evaluates the performance of supervised machine learning techniques to optimize sea level modeling. The findings reveal a consistent rise in MSLA linear trends across the basin, particularly pronounced in the northern region, with a total linear trend of 88 mm over the entire period. The highest decadal trend (38.7 mm) emerged during 2013–2020, with the most substantial percentage increment (100%) occurring in 2003–2012. Spatial variation in decadal sea-level trends was influenced by subbasin physical forcings. Strong interannual signals in the spatial sea level distribution were identified, linked to large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Seasonal variations in sea level trends are attributed to seasonal changes in the forcing factors. The evaluation of supervised learning modeling methods indicates that Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Machines are the most accurate, reproducing interannual sea level patterns in the GoG with 97% and 96% accuracy. These models could be used to derive regional sea level projections via downscaling of climate models. These findings provide essential insights for effective coastal management and climate adaptation strategies in the GoG.",

Our method simultaneously considers intra- and inter-video representation associations for reliable correspondence estimation. The intra-video learning transforms the image contents across frames within a single video via the frame pair-wise affinity. To obtain the discriminative representation for instance-level separation, we go beyond the intra-video analysis and construct the inter-video affinity to facilitate the contrastive transformation across different videos. By forcing the transformation consistency between intra- and inter-video levels, the fine-grained correspondence associations are well preserved and the instance-level feature discrimination is effectively reinforced. Our simple framework outperforms the recent self-supervised correspondence methods on a range of visual tasks including video object tracking (VOT), video object segmentation (VOS), pose keypoint tracking, etc. It is worth mentioning that our method also surpasses the fully-supervised affinity representation (e.g., ResNet) and performs competitively against the recent fully-supervised algorithms designed for the specific tasks (e.g., VOT and VOS).",

        "abstract": "Driven by the urgent demand for flood monitoring, water resource management and environmental protection, water-body detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted increasing research attention. Deep semantic segmentation networks (DSSNs) have gradually become the mainstream technology used for remote sensing image water-body detection, but two vital problems remain. One problem is that the traditional structure of DSSNs does not consider multiscale and multishape characteristics of water bodies. Another problem is that a large amount of unlabeled data is not fully utilized during the training process, but the unlabeled data often contain meaningful supervision information. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale residual network (MSResNet) that uses self-supervised learning (SSL) for water-body detection. More specifically, our well-designed MSResNet distinguishes water bodies with different scales and shapes and helps retain the detailed boundaries of water bodies. In addition, the optimization of MSResNet with our SSL strategy can improve the stability and universality of the method, and the presented SSL approach can be flexibly extended to practical applications. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets, including the 2020 Gaofen Challenge water-body segmentation dataset and the GID dataset, demonstrate that our MSResNet can obviously outperform state-of-the-art deep learning backbones and that our SSL strategy can further improve the water-body detection performance.",

        "abstract": "Water makes up about 70% of the earth’s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.",

        "abstract": "Cross-dipole sonic data have been widely accepted in the industry to characterize shear slowness measurements using borehole flexural modes. The borehole flexural mode is dispersive and sensitive to many factors such as tool structure, borehole shape, drilling fluid and formation properties. These sensitivities further enable us to characterize anisotropy, drilling features, and logging conditions. From wide-frequency-band dispersions, one can evaluate the cross-dipole dispersions to identify zones with intrinsic anisotropy, stress-induced anisotropy, or fracture-induced anisotropy. One can also check the dispersions to identify drilling features such as break-out and gas leak, and logging conditions such as tool decentralization. A good understanding of dispersion types is an essential step to guide petrophysical and geomechanical applications. Traditionally, the classification is often carried out manually through visual inspection on a depth-by-depth basis. This is mainly because the dispersion data are represented by scattered and noisy points. Consequently, such a process is time-consuming and requires  knowledge on sonic dispersion signatures.  To automate sonic data classification, we have developed an algorithm using a supervised machine-learning approach. A neural network classifier was trained using a large volume of synthetic dispersions. The training data are generated using randomly sampled input physical parameters covering effective borehole ovality model, anisotropic model and an alteration model for near wellbore concentration effects. The training datasets are labeled with these physical models. Excellent accuracy was achieved with neural network training. We then applied the classifier to field prediction, where scattered dispersion points are first reconstructed as smooth curves using a recently developed automatic dispersion interpretation algorithm. We tested the new algorithm to real field data where we observe different formation types that are dominant. The testing results show that the developed workflow is accurate in predicting dispersion types with noisy data, and efficient in handling large volume wells.  The machine-learning based workflow provides a more natural way for classification than a criteria-based algorithm, thanks to the rich physical information brought by training datasets. The outputs of the classification give ‘soft flags’ in the sense they are represented by prediction probabilities between 0 to 1 using the concept of entropy, which further enable us to evaluate co-existing dispersion signatures. This workflow serves as a key step in the quality control of sonic data and guides further applications in geomechanics where features such as stresses, intrinsic anisotropy and breakouts are key inputs. This paper will describe the methodology, including the construction of the training library, and illustrate the classification with several field examples.",

The CNN features obtained from multiple spectral bands are fused at the initial layers of deep neural networks as opposed to final layers. The early fusion architecture has fewer parameters and thereby reduces the computational time and GPU memory during training and inference. We also propose a composite fusion architecture that fuses features throughout the network. The methods were validated on four different datasets: ISPRS Potsdam, Vaihingen, IEEE Zeebruges and Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 dataset. For the Sentinel-1,-2 datasets, we obtain the ground truth labels for three classes from OpenStreetMap. Results on all the images show early fusion, specifically after layer three of the network, achieves results similar to or better than a decision level fusion mechanism. The performance of the proposed architecture is also on par with the state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an extensively implemented arc welding process through the control of input process parameters and the metal from the filler wire. Despite its popular use in various industries, the complex interrelationship between the actual bead and the varying welding parameters makes it challenging to predict appropriate bead geometries via mathematical modeling in a continually changing welding process. In this study, the Regression Learner App was used to compare the performance of supervised Machine Learning (ML) predictive models comprising the Linear Regression (LR), Regression Tree (RT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ensembles of Tree (ET), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using GMAW dataset. The dataset was scaled and normalized at a range of -1 to +1 to facilitate the visualization of the variation effect. The wire feed speed, voltage, weld velocity, unmelted wire length, and melted wire volume were considered as the input parameters to predict the bead geometry. In addition, the five-fold cross-validation was employed to avoid overfitting and poor generalization. Finally, statistical indicators, namely the Coefficient of Determination (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were performed on all developed models to evaluate their performance. Thus, the fine tree and ANN models achieved the highest prediction accuracies of 88–91%, signifying their potential use in future research. In short, the present study demonstrated the performance of various supervised ML algorithms for bead geometry prediction, which would assist the selection of appropriately supervised ML algorithms in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMost existing deep learning-based sentiment classification methods need large human-annotated data, but labeling large amounts of high-quality emotional texts is labor-intensive. Users on various social platforms generate massive amounts of tagged opinionated text (e.g., tweets, customer reviews), providing a new resource for training deep models. However, some of the tagged instances have sentiment tags that are diametrically opposed to their true semantics. We cannot use this tagged data directly because the noisy labeled instances have a negative impact on the training phase. In this paper, we present a novel Simple Weakly-supervised Contrastive Learning framework (SWCL). We use the contrastive learning strategy to pre-train the deep model on the large user-tagged data (referred to as weakly-labeled data) and then the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the small human-annotated data. We refine the contrastive loss function to better exploit inter-class contrastive patterns, making contrastive learning more applicable to the weakly-supervised setting. Besides, multiple sampling on different sentiment pairs reduces the negative impact of label noises. SWCL captures the diverse sentiment semantics of weakly labeled data and improves their suitability for downstream sentiment classification tasks. Our method outperforms the other baseline methods in experiments on the Amazon review, Twitter, and SST-5 datasets. Even when fine-tuned on 0.5 percent of the training data (i.e. 32 instances), our framework significantly boosts the deep models’ performance, demonstrating its robustness in a few-shot learning scenario.",

        "abstract": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges often involves machine learning algorithms, trained based on two independent learning strategies, namely unsupervised and supervised learning, depending on the type of training data available. When unsupervised learning strategy is employed, the algorithms are normally trained with data gathered from monitoring systems, corresponding to normal operational and environmental conditions. The lack of information regarding the dynamic response of the structure under extreme environmental and operational conditions, as well as under damage scenarios, may lead to flaws in the damage detection process, namely the rise of false indications of damage. In order to overcome this drawback, finite element models can be used as structural proxies to generate data that correspond to scenarios unlikely to be recorded by the monitoring systems, such as extreme temperatures or structural damage. The use of both monitoring and numerical data in the framework of a hybrid approach greatly improves the quality of the training process, as recently shown by the authors. The hybrid approach also enables the use of the supervised learning strategy if numerical data corresponding to damage scenarios are available. Therefore, this paper assesses the reliability of a hybrid approach for the supervised training of machine learning algorithms using numerical data corresponding to extreme temperatures and several damage scenarios. The damage scenarios comprise various degrees of settlement of a bridge pier and a landslide near the same pier. Monitoring data are used for the testing of the algorithms and for the initial calibration of the finite element model, which does not need to be exceedingly detailed, as the probabilistic variation of the uncertain parameters is taken into account. The procedure was applied to the Z-24 Bridge, a well-known benchmark consisting of one year of continuous monitoring and including progressive damage readings.",

Sarcasm detection in social networks SNs such as Twitter is a significant task as it has assisted in studying tweets using NLP. Many existing study-related methods have always focused only on the content-based on features in sarcastic words, leaving out the lexical-based features and context-based features knowledge in isolation. This shows a loss of the semantics of terms in a sarcastic expression. This study proposes an improved model to detect sarcasm from SNs. We used three feature set engineering: context-based on features set, Sarcastic based on features, and lexical based on features. Two Novel Algorithms for an effective model to detect sarcasm are divided into two stages. The first used two algorithms one with preprocessing, and the second algorithm with feature sets. To deal with data from SNs. We applied various supervised machine learning (ML) such as k-nearest neighbor classifier (KNN), na?ve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers with TF-IDF feature extraction representation data. To model evaluation metrics, evaluate sarcasm detection model performance in precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score by 100%. We achieved higher results in Lexical features with KNN 89.19 % accuracy campers to other classifiers. Combining two feature sets (Sarcastic and Lexical) has shown slight improvement with the same classifier KNN; we achieved 90.00% accuracy. When combining three feature sets (Sarcastic, Lexical, and context), the accuracy is shown slight improvement. Also, the same classifier we achieved is a 90.51% KNN classifier. We perform the model differently to see the effect of three feature sets through the experiment individual, combining two feature sets and gradually combining three feature sets. When combining all features set together, achieve the best accuracy with the KNN classifier.</p>\n\t\t</abstract>",

        "abstract": "In the fields of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, attack and anomaly detection are rising concerns. With the increased use of IoT infrastructure in every domain, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also growing proportionally. In this paper the performances of several machine learning algorithms in identifying cyber-attacks (namely SYN-DOS attacks) to IoT systems are compared both in terms of application performances, and in training/application times. We use supervised machine learning algorithms included in the MLlib library of Apache Spark, a fast and general engine for big data processing. We show the implementation details and the performance of those algorithms on public datasets using a training set of up to 2 million instances. We adopt a Cloud environment, emphasizing the importance of the scalability and of the elasticity of use. Results show that all the Spark algorithms used result in a very good identification accuracy (>99%). Overall, one of them, Random Forest, achieves an accuracy of 1. We also report a very short training time (23.22 sec for Decision Tree with 2 million rows). The experiments also show a very low application time (0.13 sec for over than 600,000 instances for Random Forest) using Apache Spark in the Cloud. Furthermore, the explicit model generated by Random Forest is very easy-to-implement using high- or low-level programming languages. In light of the results obtained, both in terms of computation times and identification performance, a hybrid approach for the detection of SYN-DOS cyber-attacks on IoT devices is proposed: the application of an explicit Random Forest model, implemented directly on the IoT device, along with a second level analysis (training) performed in the Cloud.",

However, we argue that without carefully designed augmentation techniques, augmentations on graphs may behave arbitrarily in that the underlying semantics of graphs can drastically change. As a consequence, the performance of existing augmentation-based methods is highly dependent on the choice of augmentation scheme, i.e., augmentation hyperparameters and combinations of augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel augmentation-free self-supervised learning framework for graphs, named AFGRL. Specifically, we generate an alternative view of a graph by discovering nodes that share the local structural information and the global semantics with the graph. Extensive experiments towards various node-level tasks, i.e., node classification, clustering, and similarity search on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AFGRL.

        "abstract": "\n      \n        Dictionary learning has played an important role in the success of sparse representation, which triggers the rapid developments of unsupervised and supervised dictionary learning methods. However, in most practical applications, there are usually quite limited labeled training samples while it is relatively easy to acquire abundant unlabeled training samples. Thus semi-supervised dictionary learning that aims to effectively explore the discrimination of unlabeled training data has attracted much attention of researchers. Although various regularizations have been introduced in the prevailing semi-supervised dictionary learning, how to design an effective unified model of dictionary learning and unlabeled-data class estimating and how to well explore the discrimination in the labeled and unlabeled data are still open. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative semi-supervised dictionary learning model (DSSDL) by introducing discriminative representation, an identical coding of unlabeled data to the coding of testing data final classification, and an entropy regularization term. The coding strategy of unlabeled data can not only avoid the affect of its incorrect class estimation, but also make the learned discrimination be well exploited in the final classification. The introduced regularization of entropy can avoid overemphasizing on some uncertain estimated classes for unlabeled samples. Apart from the enhanced discrimination in the learned dictionary by the discriminative representation, an extended dictionary is used to mainly explore the discrimination embedded in the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on face recognition, digit recognition and texture classification show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n      \n    ",

The network's availability is impacted by a persistent attack known as a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. Such an assault is carried out using a command and control (C & C) technique. To detect these assaults, numerous researchers have put forth various machine learning-based solutions. In this paper, we are going to detect different DDoS attacks by various methods and evaluate their performance. This experiment made use of the KD99 dataset. The normal and assault samples were classified using the random forest technique. The classification of 99.76% of the samples was accurate. By strategically selecting clusters and incorporating the insights gained from the small labelled dataset, a portion of the unlabelled clusters can be assigned labels, effectively converting raw data into useful training examples. This enriched dataset is then used to train an improved classifier that can better generalize and adapt to the dynamic nature of DDoS attacks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Single particle soot photometers (SP2) use laser-induced incandescence to detect aerosols on a single particle basis. SP2s that have been modified to provide greater spectral contrast between their narrow and broad-band incandescent detectors have previously been used to characterize both refractory black carbon (rBC) and light-absorbing metallic aerosols, including iron oxides (FeOx). However, single particles cannot be unambiguously identified from their incandescent peak height (a function of particle mass) and color ratio (a measure of blackbody temperature) alone. Machine learning offers a promising approach for improving the classification of these aerosols. Here we explore the advantages and limitations of classifying single particle signals obtained with a modified SP2 using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Laboratory samples of different aerosols that incandesce in the SP2 (fullerene soot, mineral dust, volcanic ash, coal fly ash, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4) were used to train a random forest algorithm. The trained algorithm was then applied to test data sets of laboratory samples and atmospheric aerosols. This method provides a systematic approach for classifying incandescent aerosols by providing a score, or conditional probability, that a particle is likely to belong to a particular aerosol class (rBC, FeOx, etc.) given its observed single particle features. We consider two alternative approaches for identifying aerosols in mixed populations based on their single particle SP2 response: one with specific class labels for each species sampled, and one with three broader classes (rBC, anthropogenic FeOx, and dust-like) for particles with similar SP2 responses. Predictions of the most likely particle class (the one with the highest mean probability) based on applying the trained random forest algorithm to the single particle features for test data sets comprising examples of each class are compared with the true class for those particles to estimate generalization performance. While the specific class approach performed well for rBC and Fe3O4 (≥99 % of these aerosols are correctly identified), its classification of other aerosol types is significantly worse (only 47 %–66 % of other particles are correctly identified). Using the broader class approach, we find a classification accuracy of 99 % for FeOx samples measured in the laboratory. The method allows for classification of FeOx as anthropogenic or dust-like for aerosols with effective spherical diameters from 170 to >1200 nm. The misidentification of both dust-like aerosols and rBC as anthropogenic FeOx is small, with <3 % of the dust-like aerosols and <0.1 % of rBC misidentified as FeOx for the broader class case. When applying this method to atmospheric observations taken in Boulder, CO, a clear mode consistent with FeOx was observed, distinct from dust-like aerosols.\n                    ",

        "abstract": "Current works on facial action unit (AU) recognition typically require fully AU-labeled training samples. To reduce the reliance on time-consuming manual AU annotations, we propose a novel semi-supervised AU recognition method leveraging two kinds of readily available auxiliary information. The method leverages the dependencies between AUs and expressions as well as the dependencies among AUs, which are caused by facial anatomy and therefore embedded in all facial images, independent on their AU annotation status. The other auxiliary information is facial image synthesis given AUs, the dual task of AU recognition from facial images, and therefore has intrinsic probabilistic connections with AU recognition, regardless of AU annotations. Specifically, we propose a dual semi-supervised generative adversarial network for AU recognition from partially AU-labeled and fully expressionlabeled facial images. The proposed network consists of an AU classifier C, an image generator G, and a discriminator D. In addition to minimize the supervised losses of the AU classifier and the face generator for labeled training data, we explore the probabilistic duality between the tasks using adversary learning to force the convergence of the face-AU-expression tuples generated from the AU classifier and the face generator, and the ground-truth distribution in labeled data for all training data. This joint distribution also includes the inherent AU dependencies. Furthermore, we reconstruct the facial image using the output of the AU classifier as the input of the face generator, and create AU labels by feeding the output of the face generator to the AU classifier. We minimize reconstruction losses for all training data, thus exploiting the informative feedback provided by the dual tasks. Within-database and cross-database experiments on three benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our method in both AU recognition and face synthesis compared to state-of-the-art works.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDeveloping a clinical AI model necessitates a significant amount of highly curated and carefully annotated dataset by multiple medical experts, which results in increased development time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a method that enables AI models to leverage unlabelled data to acquire domain-specific background knowledge that can enhance their performance on various downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce CypherViT, a cluster-based histo-pathology phenotype representation learning by self-supervised multi-class-token hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT). CypherViT is a novel backbone that can be integrated into a SSL pipeline, accommodating both coarse and fine-grained feature learning for histopathological images via a hierarchical feature agglomerative attention module with multiple classification (cls) tokens in ViT. Our qualitative analysis showcases that our approach successfully learns semantically meaningful regions of interest that align with morphological phenotypes. To validate the model, we utilize the DINO self-supervised learning (SSL) framework to train CypherViT on a substantial dataset of unlabeled breast cancer histopathological images. This trained model proves to be a generalizable and robust feature extractor for colorectal cancer images. Notably, our model demonstrates promising performance in patch-level tissue phenotyping tasks across four public datasets. The results from our quantitative experiments highlight significant advantages over existing state-of-the-art SSL models and traditional transfer learning methods, such as those relying on ImageNet pre-training.",

        "abstract": "Detecting key frames in videos is a common problem in many applications such as video classification, action recognition and video summarization. These tasks can be performed more efficiently using only a handful of key frames rather than the full video. Existing key frame detection approaches are mostly designed for supervised learning and require manual labelling of key frames in a large corpus of training data to train the models. Labelling requires human annotators from different backgrounds to annotate key frames in videos which is not only expensive and time consuming but also prone to subjective errors and inconsistencies between the labelers. To overcome these problems, we propose an automatic self-supervised method for detecting key frames in a video. Our method comprises a two-stream ConvNet and a novel automatic annotation architecture able to reliably annotate key frames in a video for self-supervised learning of the ConvNet. The proposed ConvNet learns deep appearance and motion features to detect frames that are unique. The trained network is then able to detect key frames in test videos. Extensive experiments on UCF101 human action and video summarization VSUMM datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The task of webly-supervised fine-grained recognition is to boost recognition accuracy of classifying subordinate categories (e.g., different bird species) by utilizing freely available but noisy web data. As the label noises significantly hurt the network training, it is desirable to distinguish and eliminate noisy images. In this paper, we propose two strategies, i.e., open-set noise removal and closed-set noise correction, to both remove such two kinds of web noises w.r.t. fine-grained recognition. Specifically, for open-set noise removal, we utilize a pre-trained deep model to perform deep descriptor transformation to estimate the positive correlation between these web images, and detect the open-set noises based on the correlation values. Regarding closed-set noise correction, we develop a top-k recall optimization loss for firstly assigning a label set towards each web image to reduce the impact of hard label assignment for closed-set noises. Then, we further propose to correct the sample with its label set as the true single label from a partial label learning perspective. Experiments on several webly-supervised fine-grained benchmark datasets show that our method obviously outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "For the task of monocular depth estimation, self-supervised learning supervises training by calculating the pixel difference between the target image and the warped reference image, obtaining results comparable to those with full supervision. However, the problematic pixels in low-texture regions are ignored, since most researchers think that no pixels violate the assumption of camera motion, taking stereo pairs as the input in self-supervised learning, which leads to the optimization problem in these regions. To tackle this problem, we perform photometric loss using the lowest-level feature maps instead and implement first- and second-order smoothing to the depth, ensuring consistent gradients ring optimization. Given the shortcomings of ResNet as the backbone, we propose a new depth estimation network architecture to improve edge location accuracy and obtain clear outline information even in smoothed low-texture boundaries. To acquire more stable and reliable quantitative evaluation results, we introce a virtual data set in the self-supervised task because these have dense depth maps corresponding to pixel by pixel. We achieve performance that exceeds that of the prior methods on both the Eigen Splits of the KITTI and VKITTI2 data sets taking stereo pairs as the input.",

        "abstract": "Most recent semi-supervised deep learning (deep SSL) methods used a similar paradigm: use network predictions to update pseudo-labels and use pseudo-labels to update network parameters iteratively. However, they lack theoretical support and cannot explain why predictions are good candidates for pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a principled end-to-end framework named deep decipher (D2) for SSL. Within the D2 framework, we prove that pseudo-labels are related to network predictions by an exponential link function, which gives a theoretical support for using predictions as pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that updating pseudo-labels by network predictions will make them uncertain. To mitigate this problem, we propose a training strategy called repetitive reprediction (R2). Finally, the proposed R2-D2 method is tested on the large-scale ImageNet dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5 percentage points.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining and rehabilitating pavement in a timely manner is essential for preserving or improving its condition, with roughness being a critical factor. Accurate prediction of road roughness is a vital component of sustainable transportation because it helps transportation planners to develop cost-effective and sustainable pavement maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. Traditional statistical methods can be less effective for this purpose due to their inherent assumptions, rendering them inaccurate. Therefore, this study employed explainable and supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the International Roughness Index (IRI) of asphalt concrete pavement in Sri Lankan arterial roads from 2013 to 2018. Two predictor variables, pavement age and cumulative traffic volume, were used in this study. Five machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), were utilized and compared with the statistical model. The study findings revealed that the machine learning algorithms’ predictions were superior to those of the regression model, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of more than 0.75, except for SVM. Moreover, RF provided the best prediction among the five machine learning algorithms due to its extrapolation and global optimization capabilities. Further, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis showed that both explanatory variables had positive impacts on IRI progression, with pavement age having the most significant effect. Providing accurate explanations for the decision-making processes in black box models using SHAP analysis increases the trust of road users and domain experts in the predictions generated by machine learning models. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the use of explainable AI-based methods was more effective than traditional regression analysis in IRI prediction. Overall, using this approach, road authorities can plan for timely maintenance to avoid costly and extensive rehabilitation. Therefore, sustainable transportation can be promoted by extending pavement life and reducing frequent reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY\nPolar regions and Greenland in particular are highly sensitive to global warming. Impacts on Greenland’s glaciers may be observed through the increasing number of calving events. However, a direct assessment of the calving activity is limited due to the remoteness of polar regions and the cloudy weather which makes impossible a recurrent observation through satellite imagery. To tackle this issue, we exploit the seismological network deployed in Greenland which actively records seismic signals associated with calving events, hereinafter referred to as glacial earthquakes. These seismic signals present a broad frequency range and a wide diversity of waveform which make them difficult to discriminate from tectonic events as well as anthropogenic and natural noises. In this study, we start from two catalogues of known events, one for glacial earthquake events which occurred between 1993 and 2013 and one for earthquakes which occurred in the same time period, and we implement a detection algorithm based on the STA/LTA method to extract signals’ events from continuous data. Then, we train and test a machine learning processing chain based on the Random Forest algorithm which allows us to automatically associate the events respectively with calving and tectonic activity, with a certain probability. Finally, we investigate 844 selected days spanning time of continuous data from the Greenland regional seismic network which results in a new, more exhaustive, catalogue of glacial earthquakes expanded of 1633 newly detected glacial events. Moreover, we extensively discuss the choice of the features used to describe glacial earthquakes, in particular the 39 new features created in this study which have drastically improved our results with 7 of the 10 best features being in the added set. The perspective of further expansion of the glacial earthquake catalogue applying the processing chain discussed in this paper on different time spans highlights how combining seismology and machine learning can increase our understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution of calving activity in remote regions.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundIdentifying human protein-phenotype relationships has attracted researchers in bioinformatics and biomedical natural language processing due to its importance in uncovering rare and complex diseases. Since experimental validation of protein-phenotype associations is prohibitive, automated tools capable of accurately extracting these associations from the biomedical text are in high demand. However, while the manual annotation of protein-phenotype co-mentions required for training such models is highly resource-consuming, extracting millions of unlabeled co-mentions is straightforward.ResultsIn this study, we propose a novel deep semi-supervised ensemble framework that combines deep neural networks, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning for classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions with the help of unlabeled data. This framework allows the ability to incorporate an extensive collection of unlabeled sentence-level co-mentions of human proteins and phenotypes with a small labeled dataset to enhance overall performance. We develop PPPredSS, a prototype of our proposed semi-supervised framework that combines sophisticated language models, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a new state-of-the-art performance in classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions by outperforming other supervised and semi-supervised counterparts. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of PPPredSS in powering a curation assistant system through case studies involving a group of biologists.ConclusionsThis article presents a novel approach for human protein-phenotype co-mention classification based on deep, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning. The insights and findings from this work have implications for biomedical researchers, biocurators, and the text mining community working on biomedical relationship extraction.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe rising sea levels due to climate change are a significant concern, particularly for vulnerable, low-lying coastal regions like the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical sea level variability, and the influencing factors, and develop a reliable modeling system for future projections. This knowledge is essential for informed planning and mitigation strategies aimed at protecting coastal communities and ecosystems. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of mean sea level anomaly (MSLA) trends in the GoG between 1993 and 2020, covering three distinct periods (1993–2002, 2003–2012, and 2013–2020). It investigates the connections between interannual sea level variability and large-scale oceanic and atmospheric forcings. Furthermore, the study evaluates the performance of supervised machine learning techniques to optimize sea level modeling. The findings reveal a consistent rise in MSLA linear trends across the basin, particularly pronounced in the northern region, with a total linear trend of 88 mm over the entire period. The highest decadal trend (38.7 mm) emerged during 2013–2020, with the most substantial percentage increment (100%) occurring in 2003–2012. Spatial variation in decadal sea-level trends was influenced by subbasin physical forcings. Strong interannual signals in the spatial sea level distribution were identified, linked to large-scale oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. Seasonal variations in sea level trends are attributed to seasonal changes in the forcing factors. The evaluation of supervised learning modeling methods indicates that Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Machines are the most accurate, reproducing interannual sea level patterns in the GoG with 97% and 96% accuracy. These models could be used to derive regional sea level projections via downscaling of climate models. These findings provide essential insights for effective coastal management and climate adaptation strategies in the GoG.",

Our method simultaneously considers intra- and inter-video representation associations for reliable correspondence estimation. The intra-video learning transforms the image contents across frames within a single video via the frame pair-wise affinity. To obtain the discriminative representation for instance-level separation, we go beyond the intra-video analysis and construct the inter-video affinity to facilitate the contrastive transformation across different videos. By forcing the transformation consistency between intra- and inter-video levels, the fine-grained correspondence associations are well preserved and the instance-level feature discrimination is effectively reinforced. Our simple framework outperforms the recent self-supervised correspondence methods on a range of visual tasks including video object tracking (VOT), video object segmentation (VOS), pose keypoint tracking, etc. It is worth mentioning that our method also surpasses the fully-supervised affinity representation (e.g., ResNet) and performs competitively against the recent fully-supervised algorithms designed for the specific tasks (e.g., VOT and VOS).",

        "abstract": "In general, one may have access to a handful of labeled normal and defect datasets. Most unlabeled datasets contain normal samples because the defect samples occurred rarely. Thus, the majority of approaches for anomaly detection are formed as unsupervised problems. Most of the previous methods have typically chosen an autoencoder to extract the common characteristics of the unlabeled dataset, assumed as normal characteristics, and determine the unsuccessfully reconstructed area as the defect area in an image. However, we could waste the ground truth data if we leave them unused. In addition, a suitable choice of threshold value is needed for anomaly segmentation. In our study, we propose a semi-supervised setting to make use of both unlabeled and labeled samples and the network is trained to segment out defect regions automatically. We first train an autoencoder network to reconstruct defect-free images from an unlabeled dataset, mostly containing normal samples. Then, a difference map between the input and the reconstructed image is calculated and feeds along with the corresponding input image into the subsequent segmentation module. We share the ground truth for both kinds of input and train the network with binary cross-entropy loss. Additional difference images can also increase stability during training. Finally, we show extensive experimental results to prove that, with help from a handful of ground-truth segmentation maps, the result is improved overall by 3.83%.",

        "abstract": "Driven by the urgent demand for flood monitoring, water resource management and environmental protection, water-body detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted increasing research attention. Deep semantic segmentation networks (DSSNs) have gradually become the mainstream technology used for remote sensing image water-body detection, but two vital problems remain. One problem is that the traditional structure of DSSNs does not consider multiscale and multishape characteristics of water bodies. Another problem is that a large amount of unlabeled data is not fully utilized during the training process, but the unlabeled data often contain meaningful supervision information. In this paper, we propose a novel multiscale residual network (MSResNet) that uses self-supervised learning (SSL) for water-body detection. More specifically, our well-designed MSResNet distinguishes water bodies with different scales and shapes and helps retain the detailed boundaries of water bodies. In addition, the optimization of MSResNet with our SSL strategy can improve the stability and universality of the method, and the presented SSL approach can be flexibly extended to practical applications. Extensive experiments on two publicly open datasets, including the 2020 Gaofen Challenge water-body segmentation dataset and the GID dataset, demonstrate that our MSResNet can obviously outperform state-of-the-art deep learning backbones and that our SSL strategy can further improve the water-body detection performance.",

        "abstract": "Water makes up about 70% of the earth’s surface and is one of the most important sources vital to sustaining life. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to a deterioration of water quality at an alarming rate, resulting in harrowing diseases. Water quality has been conventionally estimated through expensive and time-consuming lab and statistical analyses, which render the contemporary notion of real-time monitoring moot. The alarming consequences of poor water quality necessitate an alternative method, which is quicker and inexpensive. With this motivation, this research explores a series of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the water quality index (WQI), which is a singular index to describe the general quality of water, and the water quality class (WQC), which is a distinctive class defined on the basis of the WQI. The proposed methodology employs four input parameters, namely, temperature, turbidity, pH and total dissolved solids. Of all the employed algorithms, gradient boosting, with a learning rate of 0.1 and polynomial regression, with a degree of 2, predict the WQI most efficiently, having a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.9642 and 2.7273, respectively. Whereas multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with a configuration of (3, 7), classifies the WQC most efficiently, with an accuracy of 0.8507. The proposed methodology achieves reasonable accuracy using a minimal number of parameters to validate the possibility of its use in real time water quality detection systems.",

        "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning enables artificial agents to learn from related training tasks and adapt to new tasks efficiently with minimal interaction data. However, most existing research is still limited to narrow task distributions that are parametric and stationary, and does not consider out-of-distribution tasks during the evaluation, thus, restricting its application. In this paper, we propose MoSS, a context-based Meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on Self-Supervised task representation learning to address this challenge. We extend meta-RL to broad non-parametric task distributions which have never been explored before, and also achieve state-of-the-art results in non-stationary and out-of-distribution tasks. Specifically, MoSS consists of a task inference module and a policy module. We utilize the Gaussian mixture model for task representation to imitate the parametric and non-parametric task variations. Additionally, our online adaptation strategy enables the agent to react at the first sight of a task change, thus being applicable in non-stationary tasks. MoSS also exhibits strong generalization robustness in out-of-distributions tasks which benefits from the reliable and robust task representation. The policy is built on top of an off-policy RL algorithm and the entire network is trained completely off-policy to ensure high sample efficiency. On MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks, MoSS outperforms prior works in terms of asymptotic performance, sample efficiency (3-50x faster), adaptation efficiency, and generalization robustness on broad and diverse task distributions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMaterial development involves laborious processes to explore the vast materials space. The key to accelerating these processes is understanding the structure-functionality relationships of materials. Machine learning has enabled large-scale analysis of underlying relationships between materials via their vector representations, or embeddings. However, the learning of material embeddings spanning most known inorganic materials has remained largely unexplored due to the expert knowledge and efforts required to annotate large-scale materials data. Here we show that our self-supervised deep learning approach can successfully learn material embeddings from crystal structures of over 120 000 materials, without any annotations, to capture the structure-functionality relationships among materials. These embeddings revealed the profound similarity between materials, or ‘materials concepts’, such as cuprate superconductors and lithium-ion battery materials from the unannotated structural data. Consequently, our results enable us to both draw a large-scale map of the materials space, capturing various materials concepts, and measure the functionality-aware similarities between materials. Our findings will enable more strategic approaches to material development.",

Nevertheless, the use of audio descriptors and artificial intelligence techniques can make this duty more accessible. In this paper, three supervised methods, Naive Bayes, decision tree and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) are used to categorize acoustic guitar and bass sounds in a database, using as a parameter the information extracted from audio descriptors. The research resulted in a performance comparison of these three algorithms, considering their hit rates and processing time when classifying samples in different parts of the dataset. After all, some relevant considerations about the feasibility of automatically classifying instruments are presented.",

        "abstract": "Activity recognition is central to many motion analysis applications ranging from health assessment to gaming. However, the need for obtaining sufficiently large amounts of labeled data has limited the development of personalized activity recognition models. Semi-supervised learning has traditionally been a promising approach in many application domains to alleviate reliance on large amounts of labeled data by learning the label information from a small set of seed labels. Nonetheless, existing approaches perform poorly in highly dynamic settings, such as wearable systems, because some algorithms rely on predefined hyper-parameters or distribution models that needs to be tuned for each user or context. To address these challenges, we introduce LabelForest 1, a novel non-parametric semi-supervised learning framework for activity recognition. LabelForest has two algorithms at its core: (1) a spanning forest algorithm for sample selection and label inference; and (2) a silhouette-based filtering method to finalize label augmentation for machine learning model training. Our thorough analysis on three human activity datasets demonstrate that LabelForest achieves a labeling accuracy of 90.1% in presence of a skewed label distribution in the seed data. Compared to self-training and other sequential learning algorithms, LabelForest achieves up to 56.9% and 175.3% improvement in the accuracy on balanced and unbalanced seed data, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The traditional pottery industry was an important activity in Catalonia (NE Spain) up to the 20th century. However, nowadays only few workshops persist in small villages were the activity is promoted as a touristic attraction. The preservation and promotion of traditional pottery in Catalonia is part of an ongoing strategy of tourism diversification that is revitalizing the sector. The production of authenticable local pottery handicrafts aims at attracting cultivated and high-purchasing power tourists. The present paper inspects several approaches to set up a scientific protocol based on the chemical composition of both raw materials and pottery. These could be used to develop a seal of quality and provenance to regulate the sector. Six Catalan villages with a renowned tradition of local pottery production have been selected. The chemical composition of their clays and the corresponding fired products has been obtained by Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). Using the obtained geochemical dataset, a number of unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods have been applied to test their applicability to define geochemical fingerprints that could allow inter-site discrimination. The unsupervised approach fails to distinguish samples from different provenances. These methods are only roughly able to divide the different provenances in two large groups defined by their different SiO2 and CaCO3 concentrations. In contrast, almost all the tested supervised methods allow inter-site discrimination with accuracy levels above 80%, and accuracies above 85% were obtained using a meta-model combining all the predictive supervised methods. The obtained results can be taken as encouraging and demonstrative of the potential of the supervised approach as a way to define geochemical fingerprints to track or attest the provenance of samples.",

        "abstract": "Recently, intrusion detection methods based on supervised deep learning techniques (DL) have seen widespread adoption by the research community, as a result of advantages, such as the ability to learn useful feature representations from input data without excessive manual intervention. However, these techniques require large amounts of data to generalize well. Collecting a large-scale malicious sample is non-trivial, especially in the modern day with its constantly evolving landscape of cyber-threats. On the other hand, collecting a few-shot of malicious samples is more realistic in practical settings, as in cases such as zero-day attacks, where security agents are only able to intercept a limited number of such samples. Hence, intrusion detection methods based on few-shot learning is emerging as an alternative to conventional supervised learning approaches to simulate more realistic settings. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages discriminative representation learning with a supervised autoencoder to achieve few-shot intrusion detection. Our approach is implemented in two stages: we first train a feature extractor model with known classes of malicious samples using a discriminative autoencoder, and then in the few-shot detection stage, we use the trained feature extractor model to fit a classifier with a few-shot examples of the novel attack class. We are able to achieve detection rates of 99.5% and 99.8% for both the CIC-IDS2017 and NSL-KDD datasets, respectively, using only 10 examples of an unseen attack.",

        "abstract": "Lunar craters are very important for estimating the geological age of the Moon, studying the evolution of the Moon, and for landing site selection. Due to a lack of labeled samples, processing times due to high-resolution imagery, the small number of suitable detection models, and the influence of solar illumination, Crater Detection Algorithms (CDAs) based on Digital Orthophoto Maps (DOMs) have not yet been well-developed. In this paper, a large number of training data are labeled manually in the Highland and Maria regions, using the Chang’E-2 (CE-2) DOM; however, the labeled data cannot cover all kinds of crater types. To solve the problem of small crater detection, a new crater detection model (Crater R-CNN) is proposed, which can effectively extract the spatial and semantic information of craters from DOM data. As incomplete labeled samples are not conducive for model training, the Two-Teachers Self-training with Noise (TTSN) method is used to train the Crater R-CNN model, thus constructing a new model—called Crater R-CNN with TTSN—which can achieve state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, three other detection models (Mask R-CNN, no-Mask R-CNN, and Crater R-CNN) based on semi-supervised deep learning were used to detect craters in the Highland and Maria regions. The results indicate that Crater R-CNN with TTSN achieved the highest precision (of 91.4% and 88.5%, respectively) in the Highland and Maria regions, even obtaining the highest recall and F1 score. Compared with Mask R-CNN, no-Mask R-CNN, and Crater R-CNN, Crater R-CNN with TTSN had strong robustness and better generalization ability for crater detection within 1 km in different terrains, making it possible to detect small craters with high accuracy when using DOM data.",

La Fusión de Imágenes Multifoco (MFIF) parte de un conjunto de imágenes con diferente distancia focal para generar una imagen  con una profundidad de campo extendida. Lo que constituye una solución al problema de la profundidad de campo limitada en la configuración de un sistema óptico. La literatura muestra una amplia variedad de trabajos que abordan este problema. Las transformaciones de dominios y el análisis de bloques de píxeles son la base de los principales enfoques propuestos. En este trabajo se presenta una evaluación de diferentes sistemas de aprendizaje supervisado aplicados a MFIF, incluyendo k-vecinos más cercanos, análisis discriminante lineal, redes neuronales y máquinas de soporte vectorial. El método inicia con dos imágenes de la misma escena, pero con diferentes distancias focales que se dividen en regiones rectangulares. El objetivo principal del sistema de clasificación, que está basado en aprendizaje de máquina, es elegir las partes de ambas imágenes que deben estar en la imagen fusionada para obtener una imagen completamente enfocada. Para la cuantificación del enfoque se utilizaron las métricas más populares propuestas en la literatura como: la Energía Laplaciana, el Laplaciano Modificado por Suma y el Gradiente de Energía, entre otras. La evaluación del método propuesto incluye la fase de prueba de los clasificadores y las métricas de calidad de fusión utilizadas comúnmente en la investigación, tales como la fidelidad de la información visual y la característica de información mutua. Los resultados muestran que el concepto de clasificación automática puede abordar satisfactoriamente el problema MFIF.",

        "abstract": "Weed control has received great attention due to its significant influence on crop yield and food production. Accurate mapping of crop and weed is a prerequisite for the development of an automatic weed management system. In this paper, we propose a weed and crop segmentation method, SemiWeedNet, to accurately identify the weed with varying size in complex environment, where semi-supervised learning is employed to reduce the requirement of a large amount of labelled data. SemiWeedNet takes the labelled and unlabelled images into account when generating a unified semi-supervised architecture based on semantic segmentation model. A multiscale enhancement module is created by integrating the encoded feature with the selective kernel attention, to highlight the significant features of the weed and crop while alleviating the influence of complex background. To address the problem caused by the similarity and overlapping between crop and weed, an online hard example mining (OHEM) is introduced to refine the labelled data training. This forces the model to focus more on pixels that are not easily distinguished, and thus effectively improve the image segmentation. To further exploit the meaningful information of unlabelled data, consistency regularisation is introduced by maintaining the context consistency during training, making the representations robust to the varying environment. Comparative experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset. The results show the SemiWeedNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and its components have promising potential in improving segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Meta-reinforcement learning enables artificial agents to learn from related training tasks and adapt to new tasks efficiently with minimal interaction data. However, most existing research is still limited to narrow task distributions that are parametric and stationary, and does not consider out-of-distribution tasks during the evaluation, thus, restricting its application. In this paper, we propose MoSS, a context-based Meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on Self-Supervised task representation learning to address this challenge. We extend meta-RL to broad non-parametric task distributions which have never been explored before, and also achieve state-of-the-art results in non-stationary and out-of-distribution tasks. Specifically, MoSS consists of a task inference module and a policy module. We utilize the Gaussian mixture model for task representation to imitate the parametric and non-parametric task variations. Additionally, our online adaptation strategy enables the agent to react at the first sight of a task change, thus being applicable in non-stationary tasks. MoSS also exhibits strong generalization robustness in out-of-distributions tasks which benefits from the reliable and robust task representation. The policy is built on top of an off-policy RL algorithm and the entire network is trained completely off-policy to ensure high sample efficiency. On MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks, MoSS outperforms prior works in terms of asymptotic performance, sample efficiency (3-50x faster), adaptation efficiency, and generalization robustness on broad and diverse task distributions.",

The key to accelerating these processes is understanding the structure-functionality relationships of materials. Machine learning has enabled large-scale analysis of underlying relationships between materials via their vector representations, or embeddings. However, the learning of material embeddings spanning most known inorganic materials has remained largely unexplored due to the expert knowledge and efforts required to annotate large-scale materials data. Here we show that our self-supervised deep learning approach can successfully learn material embeddings from crystal structures of over 120 000 materials, without any annotations, to capture the structure-functionality relationships among materials. These embeddings revealed the profound similarity between materials, or ‘materials concepts’, such as cuprate superconductors and lithium-ion battery materials from the unannotated structural data. Consequently, our results enable us to both draw a large-scale map of the materials space, capturing various materials concepts, and measure the functionality-aware similarities between materials. Our findings will enable more strategic approaches to material development.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed in machine learning projects for its convenience of reducing self-labeled datasets in recent years. However, the implementation of SSL in large-scale recommendation systems has lagged behind the evolution because of their scarce and tailed characteristics. In 2021, an article proposed the use of SSL in recommendation systems to pursue an improvement in the performance of recommender models. This article is built on this previous investigation and aims to further explore the role of SSL in recommendation systems and to investigate an improvement of the models efficiency. To answer research questions, this paper tests three models with different numbers of towers to discover the best performance of the use of SSL in recommender models. Consequently, it is found that implementing SSL on the item side only (two-tower DNNs) produced the best result. Then, when constructing the two-tower DNNs model, this article examines different numbers of negative pairs to change the InfoNCE loss to investigate a tradeoff between the number of positive and negative samples in the performance of the model. As a result, it turns out to be a weak correlation between this ratio and the performance; Hence, it is concluded that the change of the number of positive and negative samples would not necessarily affect the two-tower DNNs model. In our experiential stage, this paper uses a real-world dataset with 100k training samples to testify and compare our results.",

        "abstract": "In processing data science, data is needed as input. Sometimes the data needed does not exist in public data, this is where the purpose of this research is made. The acquisition process is so important to process information into data. After that, the data is processed to make a decision. Micro-controller in controlling conditions, such as temperature, and humidity are very common devices, and a lot of research has been done. Sometimes discussing it only shows how to create a series and save it on online platforms, such as firebase, tinger.io, and many others online platforms. So that the process of storing data on an external or online platform is an advantage for platform providers, where platform providers do not need to do business and get data for free. This is without realizing the researchers who have produced a micro-controller device. Many platforms for storing data range from hardware and software devices. Some devices are paid or open source. This research uses software tools that are open source. Because using open source-based tools it will be easy to develop and for further research purposes. The development of the following research by entering code into a micro-controller system or what is called an embedded system. Data is a very valuable asset. Because data is one of the most important components in processing in data science. And it is better to take care of the data logger. This research uses Arduino as a micro-controller and ultrasonic distance sensor and potentiometer",

Specifically, model validation is the step used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. Here, we often integrate a cross-validation process, which we discuss in detail in this chapter. Model evaluation, on the other hand, is the process of testing the performance of the model using unseen data, the test dataset. These processes are used to ensure that the model we developed through the algorithms discussed in Chapter 6 are reliable, given our data. The chapter will include labs to give you a practical introduction to these steps, given the modeling techniques discussed in the last chapter.",

        "abstract": "The recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the fields of smart vehicles and integration empowers all cars to join to the internet and transfer sensitive traffic information. To enhance the security for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and maintain privacy, this paper proposes an ultralight authentication scheme. Physical unclonable function (PUF), supervised machine learning (SML), and XOR functions are used to authenticate both server and device in a two message flow. The proposed framework can authenticate devices with a low computation time (3 ms) compared to other proposed frameworks while protecting against existing potential threats. Furthermore, the proposed framework needs low overhead (21 bytes) that avoids adding to the IoV network’s workload. Moreover, SML makes weak PUF responses as random numbers to provide the functionality of a strong PUF for the framework. In addition, both formal (Burrows, Abadi, Needham (BAN) logic) and informal analysis are presented to show the resistance against known attacks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACTAccurately predicting chromatin loops from genome-wide interaction matrices such as Hi-C data is critical to deepen our understanding of proper gene regulation events. Current approaches are mainly focused on searching for statistically enriched dots on a genome-wide map. However, given the availability of a wide variety of orthogonal data types such as ChIA-PET, GAM, SPRITE, and high-throughput imaging, a supervised learning approach could facilitate the discovery of a comprehensive set of chromatin interactions. Here we present Peakachu, a Random Forest classification framework that predicts chromatin loops from genome-wide contact maps. Compared with current enrichment-based approaches, Peakachu identified more meaningful short-range interactions. We show that our models perform well in different platforms such as Hi-C, Micro-C, and DNA SPRITE, across different sequencing depths, and across different species. We applied this framework to systematically predict chromatin loops in 56 Hi-C datasets, and the results are available at the 3D Genome Browser (www.3dgenome.org).",

This task involves two research fields: computer vision and natural language processing; thus, it has received much attention in computer science. In this review paper, we follow the Kitchenham review methodology to present the most relevant approaches to image description methodologies based on deep learning. We focused on works using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the characteristics of images and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for automatic sentence generation. As a result, 53 research articles using the encoder-decoder approach were selected, focusing only on supervised learning. The main contributions of this systematic review are: (i) to describe the most relevant image description papers implementing an encoder-decoder approach from 2014 to 2022 and (ii) to determine the main architectures, datasets, and metrics that have been applied to image description.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMuch of the existing linguistic data in many languages of the world is locked away in non- digitized books and documents. Optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to produce digitized text, and previous work has demonstrated the utility of neural post-correction methods that improve the results of general- purpose OCR systems on recognition of less- well-resourced languages. However, these methods rely on manually curated post- correction data, which are relatively scarce compared to the non-annotated raw images that need to be digitized. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning method that makes it possible to utilize these raw images to improve performance, specifically through the use of self-training, a technique where a model is iteratively trained on its own outputs. In addition, to enforce consistency in the recognized vocabulary, we introduce a lexically aware decoding method that augments the neural post-correction model with a count-based language model constructed from the recognized texts, implemented using weighted finite-state automata (WFSA) for efficient and effective decoding. Results on four endangered languages demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, with relative error reductions of 15%–29%, where we find the combination of self-training and lexically aware decoding essential for achieving consistent improvements.1",

        "abstract": "The Smart home possesses the capability of facilitating home services to their users with the systematic advance in The Internet of Things (IoT) and information and communication technologies (ICT) in recent decades. The home service offered by the smart devices helps the users in utilize maximized level of comfort for the objective of improving life quality. As the user and smart devices communicate through an insecure channel, the smart home environment is prone to security and privacy problems. A secure authentication protocol needs to be established between the smart devices and the user, such that a situation for device authentication can be made feasible in smart home environments. Most of the existing smart home authentication protocols were identified to fail in facilitating a secure mutual authentication and increases the possibility of lunching the attacks of session key disclosure, impersonation and stolen smart device. In this paper, Secure Supervised Learning-based Smart Home Authentication Framework (SSL-SHAF) is proposed as are liable mutual authentication that can be contextually imposed for better security. The formal analysis of the proposed SSL-SHAF confirmed better resistance against session key disclosure, impersonation and stolen smart device attacks. The results of SSL-SHAF confirmed minimized computational costs and security compared to the baseline protocols considered for investigation.",

It concerns techniques that enable a cyberattacker, after establishing foothold, to maintain ongoing access and penetrate further into a network in quest of prized booty. This is done by moving through the infiltrated network and gaining elevated privileges using an assortment of tools. Concentrating on the MS Windows platform, this work provides the first to our knowledge holistic methodology supported by an abundance of experimental results towards the identification of LM via machine learning (ML) techniques. We not only assess this potential by means of both traditional and deep learning models, but also contribute a publicly available, open-source tool, which can convert Windows system monitor logs to turnkey datasets, ready to be fed into ML models. Vis-`a-vis the relevant literature, and by considering a highly unblalanced dataset and a multiclass classification problem, we report superior scores in terms of the F1 and AUC metrics, 99.41% and 99.84%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "AbstractObjectiveRecent deep learning techniques hold promise to enable IMU-driven kinetic assessment; however, they require large extents of ground reaction force (GRF) data to serve as labels for supervised model training. We thus propose using existing self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to leverage large IMU datasets to pre-train deep learning models, which can improve the accuracy and data efficiency of IMU-based GRF estimation.MethodsWe performed SSL by masking a random portion of the input IMU data and training a transformer model to reconstruct the masked portion. We systematically compared a series of masking ratios across three pre-training datasets that included real IMU data, synthetic IMU data, or a combination of the two. Finally, we built models that used pre-training and labeled data to estimate GRF during three prediction tasks: overground walking, treadmill walking, and drop landing.ResultsWhen using the same amount of labeled data, SSL pre-training significantly improved the accuracy of 3-axis GRF estimation during walking compared to baseline models trained by conventional supervised learning. Fine-tuning SSL model with 1–10% of walking data yielded comparable accuracy to training baseline model with 100% of walking data. The optimal masking ratio for SSL is 6.25–12.5%.ConclusionSSL leveraged large real and synthetic IMU datasets to increase the accuracy and data efficiency of deep-learning-based GRF estimation, reducing the need for labeled data.SignificanceThis work, with its open-source code and models, may unlock broader use cases of IMU-driven kinetic assessment by mitigating the scarcity of GRF measurements in practical applications.",

Existing M3L approaches assume a complete correspondence between  bags and  views, and also assume a complete annotation for training. However, in practice, neither the correspondence between bags, nor the bags' annotations are complete. To tackle such a weakly-supervised M3L task, a solution called WSM3L is introduced. WSM3L adapts multimodal dictionary learning to learn a shared dictionary (representational space) across views and individual encoding vectors of bags for each view. The label similarity and feature similarity of encoded bags are jointly used to match bags across views. In addition, it replenishes the annotations of a bag based on the annotations of its neighborhood bags, and introduces a dispatch and aggregation term to dispatch bag-level annotations to instances and to reversely aggregate instance-level annotations to bags. WSM3L unifies these objectives and processes in a joint objective function to predict the instance-level and bag-level annotations in a coordinated fashion, and it further introduces an alternative solution for the objective function optimization. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of WSM3L on benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderwater inspections are crucial for the preventive maintenance of offshore equipment from the oil and gas industry. However, the entire inspection process is costly, subjective and time-consuming. Traditionally, specialists assess equipment conditions through image and sensor data collected by underwater vehicles that travel to the seabed. Since this data can present a wide range of events, an inspection can yield a considerable amount of data. Despite being a tedious task, this data is undoubtedly domain-specific, requiring a group of highly specialized professionals to correctly scrutinize it. In this scenario, we propose using image classification models to help specialists find event(s) of interest. However, there are challenges inherent to the underwater inspection image classification problem, such as: high cost and scarcity of balanced labeled data, presence of label noise, high intra-class variance and characteristics of underwater images such as turbidity and uneven lightning conditions. Therefore, traditional supervised models might not fulfill the task. We undertake this problem with the methods DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO labels, self-supervised) and a new proposed method mPAWS, a multi-label version of PAWS (Predicting View Assignments With Support Samples, semi-supervised). The results obtained show the benefits of using such models for the application, achieving an improvement of $2.7\\%$ when compared to current state-of-the-art supervised models. Such models can perform real-time inference, which can help accelerate the tasks of the underwater vehicle, making the work of the specialists more time-efficient.",

        "abstract": "During the training phase of the supervised learning, it is not feasible to collect all the datasets of labelled data in an outdoor environment for the localization problem. The semi-supervised transfer learning is consequently used to pre-train a small number of labelled data from the source domain to generate a kernel knowledge for the target domain. The kernel knowledge is transferred to a target domain to transfer some unlabelled data into the virtual labelled data. In this paper, we have proposed a new outdoor localization scheme using a semi-supervised transfer learning for LoRaWANs. In the proposed localization algorithm, a grid segmentation concept is proposed so as to generate a number of virtual labelled data through learning by constructing the relationship of labelled and unlabelled data. The labelled-unlabelled data relationship is repeatedly fine-tuned by correctly adding some more virtual labelled data. Basically, the more the virtual labelled data are added, the higher the location accuracy will be obtained. In the real implementation, three types of signal features, RSSI, SNR, and timestamps, are used for training to improve the location accuracy. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme can improve the location accuracy and reduce the localization error as opposed to the existing outdoor localization schemes.",

        "abstract": "<abstract><p>Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification plays an important role in different Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in the MI-EEG classification tasks, however this technology requires a large number of labeled training samples which are difficult to obtain, and insufficient labeled training samples will result in a degradation of the classification performance. To address the degradation problem, we investigate a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) based MI-EEG classification method to reduce the dependence on a large number of labeled training samples. The proposed method includes a pretext task and a downstream classification one. In the pretext task, each MI-EEG is rearranged according to the temporal characteristic. A network is pre-trained using the original and rearranged MI-EEGs. In the downstream task, a MI-EEG classification network is firstly initialized by the network learned in the pretext task and then trained using a small number of the labeled training samples. A series of experiments are conducted on Data sets 1 and 2b of BCI competition IV and IVa of BCI competition III. In the case of one third of the labeled training samples, the proposed method can obtain an obvious improvement compared to the baseline network without using SSL. In the experiments under different percentages of the labeled training samples, the results show that the designed SSL strategy is effective and beneficial to improving the classification performance.</p></abstract>",

        "abstract": "This paper studies how to train machine-learning models that directly approximate the optimal solutions of constrained optimization problems. This is an empirical risk minimization under constraints, which is challenging as training must balance optimality and feasibility conditions. Supervised learning methods often approach this challenge by training the model on a large collection of pre-solved instances. This paper takes a different route and proposes the idea of Primal-Dual Learning (PDL), a self-supervised training method that does not require a set of pre-solved instances or an optimization solver for training and inference. Instead, PDL mimics the trajectory of an Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) and jointly trains primal and dual neural networks. Being a primal-dual method, PDL uses instance-specific penalties of the constraint terms in the loss function used to train the primal network. Experiments show that, on a set of nonlinear optimization benchmarks, PDL typically exhibits negligible constraint violations and minor optimality gaps, and is remarkably close to the ALM optimization. PDL also demonstrated improved or similar performance in terms of the optimality gaps, constraint violations, and training times compared to existing approaches.",

Moreover, dehazing performance of the learned model may deteriorate significantly when the training hazy-clean image pairs are insufficient and are different from real hazy images in applications. In this paper, we show that exploiting large scale training set and adapting to real hazy images are two critical issues in learning effective deep dehazing models. Under the depth guidance estimated by a well-trained depth estimation network, we leverage the conventional atmospheric scattering model to generate massive hazy-clean image pairs for the self-supervised pre-training of dehazing network. Furthermore, self-supervised adaptation is presented to adapt pre-trained network to real hazy images. Learning without forgetting strategy is also deployed in self-supervised adaptation by combining self-supervision and model adaptation via contrastive learning.

        "abstract": "AbstractLand suitability models for Canada are currently based on single-crop inventories and expert opinion. We present a data-driven multi-layer perceptron that simultaneously predicts the land suitability of several crops in Canada, including barley, peas, spring wheat, canola, oats, and soy. Available crop yields from 2013–2020 are downscaled to the farm level by masking the district level crop yield data to focus only on areas where crops are cultivated and leveraging soil-climate-landscape variables obtained from Google Earth Engine for crop yield prediction. This new semi-supervised learning approach can accommodate data from different spatial resolutions and enables training with unlabelled data. The incorporation of a crop indicator function further allows for the training of a multi-crop model that can capture the interdependences and correlations between various crops, thereby leading to more accurate predictions. Through k-fold cross-validation, we show that compared to the single crop models, our multi-crop model could produce up to a 2.82 fold reduction in mean absolute error for any particular crop. We found that barley, oats, and mixed grains were more tolerant to soil-climate-landscape variations and could be grown in many regions of Canada, while non-grain crops were more sensitive to environmental factors. Predicted crop suitability was associated with a region’s growing season length, which supports climate change projections that regions of northern Canada will become more suitable for agricultural use.

        "abstract": "We propose a method for effectively utilizing weakly annotated image data in an object detection tasks of breast ultrasound images. Given the problem setting where a small, strongly annotated dataset and a large, weakly annotated dataset with no bounding box information are available, training an object detection model becomes a non-trivial problem. We suggest a controlled weight for handling the effect of weakly annotated images in a two stage object detection model. We also present a subsequent active learning scheme for safely assigning weakly annotated images a strong annotation using the trained model. Experimental results showed a 24% point increase in correct localization (CorLoc) measure, which is the ratio of correctly localized and classified images, by assigning the properly controlled weight. Performing active learning after a model is trained showed an additional increase in CorLoc. We tested the proposed method on the Stanford Dog datasets to assure that it can be applied to general cases, where strong annotations are insufficient to obtain resembling results. The presented method showed that higher performance is achievable with lesser annotation effort.",

From 143 articles using Add Health data Waves I through IV, 62 adolescent family variables from eight domains (e.g., socioeconomics, parenting, health) were identified as predictors of young adult (ages 24–32) educational attainment. Following benchmark regression models, ML models were trained using Lasso regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting; these were tested separately from training data and interpreted through SHapley Additive exPlanations.ResultsThe random forest model performed best (R2 = .382 for the model with all the predictors): 14 variables were identified to be the key predictors of educational attainment. Patterns among these predictors, including directionality, nonlinearity and interactions emerged.ConclusionsSupervised ML research can be used to inform further confirmatory analyses and advance theory.",

        "abstract": "The performance of existing supervised neuron segmentation methods is highly dependent on the number of accurate annotations, especially when applied to large scale electron microscopy (EM) data. By extracting semantic information from unlabeled data, self-supervised methods can improve the performance of downstream tasks, among which the mask image model (MIM) has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in recovering original information from masked images. However, due to the high degree of structural locality in EM images, as well as the existence of considerable noise, many voxels contain little discriminative information, making MIM pretraining inefficient on the neuron segmentation task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decision-based MIM that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically search for optimal image masking ratio and masking strategy. Due to the vast exploration space, using single-agent RL for voxel prediction is impractical. Therefore, we treat each input patch as an agent with a shared behavior policy, allowing for multi-agent collaboration. Furthermore, this multi-agent model can capture dependencies between voxels, which is beneficial for the downstream segmentation task. Experiments conducted on representative EM datasets demonstrate that our approach has a significant advantage over alternative self-supervised methods on the task of neuron segmentation.

ML techniques are divided into two approaches: supervised and unsupervised learning, since we herein testified an OM feature selection(FS)using four ML techniques. In this paper, we had implemented number of experiments via four machine learning techniques on the same three Arabic language corpora. This paper aims at increasing the accuracy of opinion highlighting on Arabic language, by using enhanced feature selection approaches. FS proposed model is adopted for enhancing opinion highlighting purpose. The experimental results show the outperformance of the proposed approaches in variant levels of supervisory,i.e. different techniques via distinct data domains.

Specifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference tokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the reference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with multi-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction tasks.

        "abstract": "Abstract. Discourse may contain both named and nominal entities. Most common nouns or nominal mentions in natural language do not have a single, simple meaning but rather a number of related meanings. This form of ambiguity led to the development of a task in natural language processing known as Word Sense Disambiguation. Recognition and categorisation of named and nominal entities is an essential step for Word Sense Disambiguation methods. Up to now, named entity recognition and categorisation systems mainly focused on the annotation, categorisation and identification of named entities. This paper focuses on the annotation and the identification of spatial nominal entities. We explore the combination of Transfer Learning principle and supervised learning algorithms, in order to build a system to detect spatial nominal entities. For this purpose, different supervised learning algorithms are evaluated with three different context sizes on two manually annotated datasets built from Wikipedia articles and hiking description texts. The studied algorithms have been selected for one or more of their specific properties potentially useful in solving our problem. The results of the first phase of experiments reveal that the selected algorithms have similar performances in terms of ability to detect spatial nominal entities. The study also confirms the importance of the size of the window to describe the context, when word-embedding principle is used to represent the semantics of each word.  \n                    ",

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has received increasing attention in the field of skeleton-based action representations in recent years. Most contrastive learning methods use simple augmentation strategies to construct pairs of positive samples. When using such pairs of positive samples to learn action representations, deeper feature information cannot be learned, thus affecting the performance of downstream tasks. To solve the problem of insufficient learning ability, we propose an asymmetric data augmentation strategy and attempt to apply it to the training of 3D skeleton-based action representations. First, we carefully study the different characteristics presented by different skeleton views and choose a specific augmentation method for a certain view. Second, specific augmentation methods are incorporated into the left and right branches of the asymmetric data augmentation pipeline to increase the convergence difficulty of the contrastive learning task, thereby significantly improving the quality of the learned action representations. Finally, since many methods directly act on the joint view, the augmented samples are quite different from the original samples. We use random probability activation to transform the joint view to avoid extreme augmentation of the joint view. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB + D datasets show that our method is effective.",

In fact, however, it is difficult to meet the requirement of sufficient and redundant views At the same time, the constraints of Co-Training is further relaxed to solve the problem of inaccurate confidence estimation of unlabeled samples. In this paper, imml-knn and mlplsa-knn are used to train the basic classifiers with great difference. By using unlabeled data in the way of providing Pseudotag sample to each other, a Multi-Label Text Classification Algorithm CT-MLTC based on Co-Training is proposed. Experimental results show that the algorithm has good performance in multi label text classification tasks with more unlabeled data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractUrinary Incontinence affects over 200 million people worldwide, severely impacting the quality of life of individuals. Bladder state detection technology has the potential to improve the lives of people with urinary incontinence by alerting the user before voiding occurs. To this end, the objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using supervised machine learning classifiers to determine the bladder state of ‘full’ or ‘not full’ from electrical impedance measurements. Electrical impedance data was obtained from computational models and a realistic experimental pelvic phantom. Multiple datasets with increasing complexity were formed for varying noise levels in simulation. 10-Fold testing was performed on each dataset to classify ‘full’ and ‘not full’ bladder states, including phantom measurement data. Support vector machines and k-Nearest-Neighbours classifiers were compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The minimum and maximum accuracies across all datasets were 73.16% and 100%, respectively. Factors that contributed most to misclassification were the noise level and bladder volumes near the threshold of ‘full’ or ‘not full’. This paper represents the first study to use machine learning for bladder state detection with electrical impedance measurements. The results show promise for impedance-based bladder state detection to support those living with urinary incontinence.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThe advent of metagenomic sequencing provides microbial abundance patterns that can be leveraged for sample origin prediction. Supervised machine learning classification approaches have been reported to predict sample origin accurately when the origin has been previously sampled. Using metagenomic datasets provided by the 2019 CAMDA challenge, we evaluated the influence of variable technical, analytical and machine learning approaches for result interpretation and novel source prediction.ResultsComparison between 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun sequencing approaches as well as metagenomic analytical tools showed differences in normalized microbial abundance, especially for organisms present at low abundance. Shotgun sequence data analyzed using Kraken2 and Bracken, for taxonomic annotation, had higher detection sensitivity. As classification models are limited to labeling pre-trained origins, we took an alternative approach using Lasso-regularized multivariate regression to predict geographic coordinates for comparison. In both models, the prediction errors were much higher in Leave-1-city-out than in 10-fold cross validation, of which the former realistically forecasted the increased difficulty in accurately predicting samples from new origins. This challenge was further confirmed when applying the model to a set of samples obtained from new origins. Overall, the prediction performance of the regression and classification models, as measured by mean squared error, were comparable on mystery samples. Due to higher prediction error rates for samples from new origins, we provided an additional strategy based on prediction ambiguity to infer whether a sample is from a new origin. Lastly, we report increased prediction error when data from different sequencing protocols were included as training data.ConclusionsHerein, we highlight the capacity of predicting sample origin accurately with pre-trained origins and the challenge of predicting new origins through both regression and classification models. Overall, this work provides a summary of the impact of sequencing technique, protocol, taxonomic analytical approaches, and machine learning approaches on the use of metagenomics for prediction of sample origin.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we aim to learn highly descriptive representations for a wide set of machinery sounds and exploit this knowledge to perform condition monitoring of mechanical equipment. We propose a comprehensive feature learning approach that operates on raw audio, by supervising the formation of salient audio embeddings in latent states of a deep temporal convolutional neural network. By fusing the supervised feature learning approach with an unsupervised deep one-class neural network, we are able to model the characteristics of each source and implicitly detect anomalies in different operational states of industrial machines. Moreover, we enable the exploitation of spatial audio information in the learning process, by formulating a novel front-end processing strategy for circular microphone arrays. Experimental results on the MIMII dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, reaching a state-of-the-art mean AUC score of 91.0%. Anomaly detection performance is significantly improved by incorporating multi-channel audio data in the feature extraction process, as well as training the convolutional neural network on the spatially invariant front-end. Finally, the proposed semi-supervised approach allows the concise modeling of normal machine conditions and accurately detects system anomalies, compared to existing anomaly detection methods.",

Currently, many available glioma datasets often contain some unlabeled brain scans, and many datasets are moderate in size.\n\nMethods\nWe propose to exploit deep semi-supervised learning to make full use of the unlabeled data. Deep CNN features were incorporated into a new graph-based semi-supervised learning framework for learning the labels of the unlabeled data, where a new 3D-2D consistent constraint is added to make consistent classifications for the 2D slices from the same 3D brain scan. A deep-learning classifier is then trained to classify different glioma types using both labeled and unlabeled data with estimated labels. To alleviate the overfitting caused by moderate-size datasets, synthetic MRIs generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are added in the training of CNNs.\n\nResults\nThe proposed scheme has been tested on two glioma datasets, TCGA dataset for IDH-mutation prediction (molecular-based glioma subtype classification) and MICCAI dataset for glioma grading. Our results have shown good performance (with test accuracies 86.53% on TCGA dataset and 90.70% on MICCAI dataset).\n\nConclusions\nThe proposed scheme is effective for glioma IDH-mutation prediction and glioma grading, and its performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art.\n",

        "abstract": " University students face immense challenges in current situations in ideological and political research. Therefore, the way ideological work constantly needs to be adapted, and the exchange of advanced experience strengthened to increase ideological and political education (IPE) in universities. Specific methods of university administration may include only ideological and political courses. Courses information and student grades did not conduct an ideological or political evaluation of the student. They assessed the psychological behaviors of the student based on their success, nor did them include clear information on the course schedule for specific ideological and political courses. This article, Supervised learning-based teaching evaluation approach (SL-TEA), has been proposed to focus on supervised learning from ideas about machine learning technology and the current IPE status, to be developed using a brief analysis procedure. Supervised learning uses a practice set to provide the necessary quality through teaching models. Inputs and correct outputs that allow the model to learn over time are part of this training data. The study uses the system of experts to manage, operate and monitor model evaluation data and create a related database for a real-time update. Besides, to check the impact of the model and to run simulation tests. This study SL-TEA model follows the real needs of the system that the ideological and political teaching content of colleges and colleges can be evaluated. Thus, the experimental results show the better performance through the highest student accuracy ratio of 97.1 %, a high-performance ratio of 94.3%, improved political thinking rate of 92.8%, improved actual positive rate of 90.2%, the false-positive rate of 92.2%, enhance learning rate of 96.6% and reduce the error rate 21.2%, compared to other methods.

        "abstract": "While deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision and many other fields, currently it does not work very well on patient genomic data with the “big p, small N” problem (i.e., a relatively small number of samples with highdimensional features). In order to make deep learning work with a small amount of training data, we have to design new models that facilitate few-shot learning. Here we present the Affinity Network Model (AffinityNet), a data efficient deep learning model that can learn from a limited number of training examples and generalize well. The backbone of the AffinityNet model consists of stacked k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) attention pooling layers. The kNN attention pooling layer is a generalization of the Graph Attention Model (GAM), and can be applied to not only graphs but also any set of objects regardless of whether a graph is given or not. As a new deep learning module, kNN attention pooling layers can be plugged into any neural network model just like convolutional layers. As a simple special case of kNN attention pooling layer, feature attention layer can directly select important features that are useful for classification tasks. Experiments on both synthetic data and cancer genomic data from TCGA projects show that our AffinityNet model has better generalization power than conventional neural network models with little training data.",

This research aims to target the falsehood part of the infodemic, which prominently proliferates in news articles and false medical publications. Here, we present NeoNet, a novel supervised machine learning text mining algorithm that analyzes the content of a document (news article, a medical publication) and assigns a label to it. The algorithm is trained by TFIDF bigram features which contribute a network training model. The algorithm is tested on two different real-world datasets from the CBC news network and Covid-19 publications. In five different fold comparisons, the algorithm predicted a label of an article with a precision of 97-99 %. When compared with prominent algorithms such as Neural Networks, SVM, and Random Forests NeoNet surpassed them. The analysis highlighted the promise of NeoNet in detecting disputed online contents which may contribute negatively to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In the ideal case, iSCAT is limited by shot noise so that collection of more photons should allow its detection sensitivity to biomolecules of arbitrarily low mass. However, a number of technical noise sources combined with speckle-like background fluctuations have restricted the detection limit in iSCAT. Here, we show that an unsupervised machine learning isolation forest algorithm for anomaly detection pushes the mass sensitivity limit by a factor of four to below 10 kDa. We implement this scheme both with a user-defined feature matrix and a self-supervised FastDVDNet and validate our results with correlative fluorescence images recorded in total internal reflection mode. Our work opens the door to the optical detection of small traces of disease markers such as alpha-synuclein, chemokines, and cytokines.",

The matching is used to improve the efficiency. Existing variable selection methods for matched case–control studies are challenged in high-dimensional settings where interactions among variables are also important. We describe a quite different method for high-dimensional matched case–control data, based on the potential outcome model, which is not only flexible regarding the number of matching and exposure variables but also able to detect interaction effects.\n\n\nResults\nWe present Matched Forest (MF), an algorithm for variable selection in matched case–control data. The method preserves the case and control values in each instance but transforms the matched case–control data with added counterfactuals. A modified variable importance score from a supervised learner is used to detect important variables. The method is conceptually simple and can be applied with widely available software tools. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of MF in identifying important variables. MF is also applied to data from the biomedical domain and its performance is compared with alternative approaches.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nR code for implementing MF is available at https://github.com/NooshinSh/Matched_Forest.\n\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Presently, there is a wide variety of classification methods and deep neural networks approaches in bioinformatics. Deep neural networks have proven their effectiveness for classification tasks, and have outperformed classical methods, but they suffer from a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these innovative methods are not appropriate for decision support systems in healthcare. The algorithm should provide the main pieces of information allowing computed diagnosis and prognosis for the final decision by the clinician. To address this lack of interpretability, we used a new supervised autoencoder (SAE). The main advantage of our supervised autoencoder is its ability to provide a diagnosis with a confidence score for each patient thanks to a softmax classifier, and a meaningful latent space visualization. This confidence score and visual evaluation are crucial for clinical interpretability. Moreover, we used a new efficient feature selection method with a structured constraint for biologically interpretable results. Experimental results on three metabolomics datasets of clinical samples illustrate the effectiveness of our confidence score diagnostic method: Results: The supervised autoencoder provides an accurate localization of the patients in the latent space, and an efficient confidence score. Experiments show that the SAE outperforms classical methods (PLS-DA, Random Forests, SVM, and neural networks (NN)). Furthermore, the metabolites selected by the SAE were found to be relevant. Conclusion: In this paper, we have proposed a new efficient method for diagnosis or prognosis support using clinical metabolomics analyses.",

        "abstract": "The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the most pernicious threats in cyberspace. Catastrophic failures over the past two decades have resulted in catastrophic and costly disruption of services across all sectors and critical infrastructure. Machine-learning-based approaches have shown promise in developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for detecting cyber-attacks, such as DDoS. Herein, we present a solution to detect DDoS attacks through an ensemble-based machine learning approach that combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning ensemble frameworks. This combination produces higher performance in detecting known DDoS attacks using supervised ensemble and for zero-day DDoS attacks using an unsupervised ensemble. The unsupervised ensemble, which employs novelty and outlier detection, is effective in identifying prior unseen attacks. The ensemble framework is tested using three well-known benchmark datasets, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017. The results show that ensemble classifiers significantly outperform single-classifier-based approaches. Our model with combined supervised and unsupervised ensemble models correctly detects up to 99.1% of the DDoS attacks, with a negligible rate of false alarms.",

Both positive and negative examples are needed to perform supervised and semi-supervised learning. However, GRN datasets include only positive examples and/or unlabeled ones. Recently a growing interest is being devoted to the generation of negative examples from unlabeled data. Within this context, the authors propose to generate potential negative examples from the set of unlabeled ones and keep those that lead to the best classification accuracy when used with positive examples. A new proposed genetic algorithm for fixed-size subset selection has been combined with a support vector machine model for this purpose. The authors assessed the performance of the proposed approach using simulated and experimental datasets. Using simulated datasets, the proposed approach outperforms the other methods in most cases and improves the performance metrics when using balanced data. Experimental datasets show that the proposed approach allows finding the optimal solution for each transcription factor in this study.",

        "abstract": "Success and failure in oil and gas exploration is heavily dependent upon the quantity and quality of the subsurface data used during the analysis. Traditionally, the quality of seismic data has been characterised through the domain expertise of geoscientists and through traditional analytical methods, such as frequency decomposition, autocorrelations and signal to noise ratios. Unfortunately, due to the non-linearity and spatial heterogeneity of the data, these analytical methods can be unreliable or difficult to interpret by geoscientists. Machine learning, in particular deep learning, has been shown to analyse subsurface data in a multitude of ways by integrating domain expertise with powerful non-linear mathematical analysis. Thus, it seems that deep learning could be a natural fit for evaluating seismic data quality. In this paper we outline the issues of what is considered good- and bad-quality seismic data and introduce the labelling scheme that was implemented for the supervised learning. Examples of the labelling are shown, as well as the challenges encountered during the extensive labelling process. Neural network architecture testing and validation of the architecture are shown. Finally, applications to three-dimensional datasets on the North West Shelf, how the results can be interpreted and potential further avenues of research are discussed.",

This paper presents the potential of an Autoencoders (AEs) and Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs)-based self-supervised learning approach for the decorrelation and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional vegetation indices derived from satellite observations. This research was implemented in Mt. Zao and its base in northeast Japan with a cool temperate climate by collecting the ground truth points belonging to 16 vegetation types (including some non-vegetation classes) in 2018. Monthly median composites of 16 vegetation indices were generated by processing all Sentinel-2 scenes available for the study area from 2017 to 2019. The performance of AEs and CAEs-based compressed images for the clustering and visualization of vegetation types was quantitatively assessed by computing the bootstrap resampling-based confidence interval. The AEs and CAEs-based compressed images with three features showed around 4% and 9% improvements in the confidence intervals respectively over the classical method. CAEs using convolutional neural networks showed better feature extraction and dimensionality reduction capacity than the AEs. The class-wise performance analysis also showed the superiority of the CAEs.

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have emerged as a powerful tool to study and in some cases forecast natural disasters [1,2]. Recent works have successfully combined deep learning modeling with scientific knowledge stemming from the SAR Interferometry domain propelling research on tasks like volcanic activity monitoring [3], associated with ground deformation. A milestone in this interdisciplinary field has been the release of the Hephaestus [4] InSAR dataset, facilitating automatic InSAR interpretation, volcanic activity localization as well as the detection and categorization of atmospheric contributions in wrapped interferograms. Hephaestus contains annotations for approximately 20,000 InSAR frames, covering the 44 most active volcanoes in the world. The annotation was performed&#160; by a team of InSAR experts that manually examined each InSAR frame individually. However, even with such a large dataset, class imbalance remains a challenge, i.e. the InSAR samples containing volcano deformation fringes are orders of magnitude less than those that do not. This is anticipated since natural hazards are in principle rare in nature. To counter that, the authors of Hephaestus provide more than 100,000 unlabeled InSAR frames to be used for global large-scale self-supervised learning, which is more robust to class imbalance when compared to supervised learning [5].&#160;Motivated by the Hephaestus dataset and the insights provided by [2], we train global, task-agnostic models in a self-supervised learning fashion that can handle distribution shifts caused by spatio-temporal variability as well as major class imbalances. By finetuning such a model to the labeled part of Hephaestus we obtain the backbone for a global volcanic activity alerting system, namely Pluto. Pluto is a novel end-to-end AI based system that provides early warnings of volcanic unrest on a global scale.Pluto automatically synchronizes its database with the Comet-LiCS [6] portal to receive newly generated Sentinel-1 InSAR data acquired over volcanic areas. The new samples are fed to our volcanic activity detection model. If volcanic activity is detected, an automatic email is sent to the service users, which contains information about the intensity, the exact location and the type (Mogi, Sill, Dyk) of the event. To ensure a robust and ever-improving service we augment Pluto with an iterative pipeline that collects samples that were misclassified in production, and uses them to further improve the existing model.&#160;&#160;[1] Kondylatos et al. \"Wildfire danger prediction and understanding with Deep Learning.\" Geophysical Research Letters 49.17 (2022): e2022GL099368.[2] Bountos et al. \"Self-supervised contrastive learning for volcanic unrest detection.\" IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters 19 (2021): 1-5.[3] Bountos et al. \"Learning from Synthetic InSAR with Vision Transformers: The case of volcanic unrest detection.\" IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (2022).[4] Bountos et al. \"Hephaestus: A large scale multitask dataset towards InSAR understanding.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF CVPR. 2022.[5] Liu et al. \"Self-supervised learning is more robust to dataset imbalance.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.05025 (2021).[6] Lazeck&#253; et al. \"LiCSAR: An automatic InSAR tool for measuring and monitoring tectonic and volcanic activity.\" Remote Sensing 12.15 (2020): 2430.",

Therefore, detecting DN early is important. This study presents an approach for diagnosing various stages of the progression of DM in lower extremities using machine learning to classify individuals with prediabetes (PD; n = 19), diabetes without (D; n = 62), and diabetes with peripheral neuropathy (DN; n = 29) based on dynamic pressure distribution collected using pressure-measuring insoles. Dynamic plantar pressure measurements were recorded bilaterally (60 Hz) for several steps during the support phase of walking while participants walked at self-selected speeds over a straight path. Pressure data were grouped and divided into three plantar regions: rearfoot, midfoot, and forefoot. For each region, peak plantar pressure, peak pressure gradient, and pressure–time integral were calculated. A variety of supervised machine learning algorithms were used to assess the performance of models trained using different combinations of pressure and non-pressure features to predict diagnoses. The effects of choosing various subsets of these features on the model’s accuracy were also considered. The best performing models produced accuracies between 94–100%, showing the proposed approach can be used to augment current diagnostic methods.",

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised deep learning for the biomedical graph and advanced manufacturing graph is rapidly becoming an important topic in both academia and industry. Many existing types of research focus on semi-supervised link prediction and node classification, as well as the application of these methods in sustainable development and advanced manufacturing. To date, most manufacturing graph neural networks are mainly evaluated on social and information networks, which improve the quality of network representation y integrating neighbor node descriptions. However, previous methods have not yet been comprehensively studied on biomedical networks. Traditional techniques fail to achieve satisfying results, especially when labeled nodes are deficient in number. In this paper, a new semi-supervised deep learning method for the biomedical graph via sustainable knowledge transfer called SeBioGraph is proposed. In SeBioGraph, both node embedding and graph-specific prototype embedding are utilized as transferable metric space characterized. By incorporating prior knowledge learned from auxiliary graphs, SeBioGraph further promotes the performance of the target graph. Experimental results on the two-class node classification tasks and three-class link prediction tasks demonstrate that the SeBioGraph realizes state-of-the-art results. Finally, the method is thoroughly evaluated.",

This study has been conducted to develop a new non-linear subspace learning method named “supervised kernel locality-based discriminant neighborhood embedding,” which performs data classification by learning an optimum embedded subspace from a principal high dimensional space. In this approach, not only nonlinear and complex variation of face images is effectively represented using nonlinear kernel mapping, but local structure information of data from the same class and discriminant information from distinct classes are also simultaneously preserved to further improve final classification performance. Moreover, in order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, it was compared with several well-known pattern recognition methods through comprehensive experiments with six publicly accessible datasets. Experiment results reveal that our method consistently outperforms its competitors, which demonstrates strong potential to be implemented in many real-world systems.",

        "abstract": "Economic Intrusion detection is discovering unauthorized net-work activity and recognizing whether the data is an abnormal network transmission. Recent research has focused on semi-supervised learning mechanisms for identifying abnormal net-work traffic to deal with both labeled and unlabeled in industry. Economic shift generation is very crucial in creating a balance between hyper sensitive generation and superficial balance. However, real-time training and classifying network traffic remains as challenges, as they can lead to the degradation of the overall dataset and difficulties in preventing attacks. Addi-tionally, existing semi-supervised learning research may not comprehensively analyze the experimental results. To address these issues, we propose XA-GANomaly, a novel technique for explainable adaptive semi-supervised learning using GANoma-ly, an image anomalous detection model, that sequentially trains small subsets in a dynamic way. First, we introduce a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based GANomaly for semi-supervised learning. Second, we present our proposed adaptive algorithm for DNN-based GANomaly, validated with four sub-sets of the adaptive dataset. Finally, we demonstrate a monitor-ing system that incorporating three explainable techniques – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), reconstruction error visualization, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) – to respond effectively to attacks toward traffic data at each stage of feature engineering, semi-supervised learning, and adaptive learning. Compared to other single-class classifi-cation techniques, the proposed DNN-based GANomaly achieves higher scores than 13% and 8% of F1 scores and accuracy of 4.17% and 11.51% for the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, respectively. In addition, our adaptive learning experiments show mostly improved results over initial values, and we provide an analysis and monitoring system based on the combination of the three explainable methodologies. As a result, our proposed method has the potential to be applied in the real industry, and future research will explore on handling unbalanced real-time datasets in various scenarios.The essence of such shifts in economic paradigm can be better understood by applying various triggers in functional machine to machine interaction.This can be better understood by creating a super-vised paradigm which better understands global economic shifts.",

Limited research is done in the area of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that leverage unlabelled data and none that utilize contrastive SSL. However, with the dominance of contrastive SSL in domains such as computer vision, it is essential to see if the same excellence in performance can be obtained on an ECG-based stress assessment dataset. In this paper, we propose a contrastive SSL model for stress assessment using ECG signals based on the SimCLR framework. We test our model on two ECG-based stress assessment datasets. We show that our proposed solution results in a 9% improvement in accuracy on the WESAD dataset and 3.7% on the RML dataset when compared with SOTA ECG-based SSL models for stress assessment. The development of more accurate stress assessment models, particularly those that employ non-invasive data such as ECG for assessment, leads to developments in wearable technology and the creation of better health monitoring applications in areas such as stress management and relaxation therapy.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis helps to determine hidden intention of the concerned author of any topic and provides an evaluation report on the polarity of any document. The polarity may be positive, negative or neutral. It is observed that very often the data associated with the sentiment analysis consist of the feedback given by various specialists on any topic or product. Thus, the review may be categorized properly into any sort of class based on the polarity, in order to have a good knowledge about the product. This article proposes an approach to classify the review dataset made on basis of sentiment analysis into different polarity groups. Four machine learning algorithms viz., Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have been considered in this paper for classification process. The obtained result on values of accuracy of the algorithms are critically examined by using different performance parameters, applied on two different datasets.",

        "abstract": "During ASIM operations from June 2018 until the end of 2019, 486 TGFs were observed. For this task, the ASDC (ASIM Science Data Center) dealt with numerous triggers from the instrument (5000 per week). The relocation of the instrument from EPF SDX to EPF SDN (Starboard Deck Nadir) of the Columbus ISS Module on January 10, 2022, demonstrated that the MXGS location capabilities could be used not only for TGF location but also for imaging GRB events, as its Field of View in the SDN port encompasses both Earth and space.\nIt's worth noting that only a few of the ASIM triggers correspond to TGF events. There is a screening process employing a series of algorithms to detect and discard false positives (triggers that are not TGFs). Nevertheless, the ASIM archive retains all data from every trigger. Due to the extended operational time, there is currently a sufficiently large database that enables us to present the initial results here using novel machine learning methods, such as kernel methods or neural networks, for the automatic categorization of both present and future events.\nFurthermore, our interest goes beyond mere classification, as we are currently investigating whether various explainability methods applied to these techniques can assist in identifying the relevant features of the signal for such classification. The aim of this work is to provide a tool to quantify new physical processes that could be the cause of instrument triggers and to examine whether there is a connection with the Earth-Space global circuit.",

        "abstract": "AbstractCompletely labeled pathology datasets are often challenging and time-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are able to learn from fewer labeled data points with the help of a large number of unlabeled data points. In this paper, we investigated the possibility of using clustering analysis to identify the underlying structure of the data space for SSL. A cluster-then-label method was proposed to identify high-density regions in the data space which were then used to help a supervised SVM in finding the decision boundary. We have compared our method with other supervised and semi-supervised state-of-the-art techniques using two different classification tasks applied to breast pathology datasets. We found that compared with other state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods, our SSL method is able to improve classification performance when a limited number of labeled data instances are made available. We also showed that it is important to examine the underlying distribution of the data space before applying SSL techniques to ensure semi-supervised learning assumptions are not violated by the data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractManual behavioral observations have been applied in both environment and laboratory experiments in order to analyze and quantify animal movement and behavior. Although these observations contributed tremendously to ecological and neuroscientific disciplines, there have been challenges and disadvantages following in their footsteps. They are not only time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone but they can also be subjective, which induces further difficulties in reproducing the results. Therefore, there is an ongoing endeavor towards automated behavioral analysis, which has also paved the way for open-source software approaches. Even though these approaches theoretically can be applied to different animal groups, the current applications are mostly focused on mammals, especially rodents. However, extending those applications to other vertebrates, such as birds, is advisable not only for extending species-specific knowledge but also for contributing to the larger evolutionary picture and the role of behavior within. Here we present an open-source software package as a possible initiation of bird behavior classification. It can analyze pose-estimation data generated by established deep-learning-based pose-estimation tools such as DeepLabCut for building supervised machine learning predictive classifiers for pigeon behaviors, which can be broadened to support other bird species as well. We show that by training different machine learning and deep learning architectures using multivariate time series data as input, an F1 score of 0.874 can be achieved for a set of seven distinct behaviors. In addition, an algorithm for further tuning the bias of the predictions towards either precision or recall is introduced, which allows tailoring the classifier to specific needs.",

Previous studies typically assume that for each instance, the full set of relevant labels associated with each training instance is given. In many applicationssuch as image annotation, however, it’s usually difficult to get the full label set for each instance and only a partial or even empty set of relevant labels is available. We call this kind of problem as \"semi-supervised weak-label learning\" problem. In this work we propose the SSWL (Semi-Supervised Weak-Label) method to address this problem. Both instance similarity and label similarity are considered for the complement of missing labels. Ensemble of multiple models are utilized to improve the robustness when label information is insufficient. We formulate the objective as a bi-convex optimization problem with an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm. Experiments validate the effectiveness of SSWL.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "The continuous increase of digital documents on the web creates the need to search for information patterns that allow the categorization of organizational documents to generate knowledge in an institution. An Artificial Intelligence technique for this purpose is text classification, it for its application uses labels (previously categorized documents) with supervised (with labels) or unsupervised (without labels) training models. Both traditional models with their advantages and disadvantages have been joined into semi-supervised models that extract the best qualities of each one, however, the labeling process involves resources and time that try to be optimized to improve classification accuracy.\r\nAn analysis of the different semi-supervised models would show us the advantages of their training and the way how the structure of each of them affects the accuracy of their classification. In the present study, a classification structure of the semi-supervised models in the classification of documents is proposed to analyze their qualities and categorization process, through an SLR (Revision of systematic literature) that extracts performance metrics from the identified studies to perform a meta-analysis through forest plots.\r\nTo define the search strategy for studies, the PICOC (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outputs, Context) method has been used, it is supported by the research question defines a search string, which has allowed the collection of 228 research, these are filtered with the PRISMA declaration method and the determination of exclusion criteria, in this way 35 researches are selected for the present study.\r\nThe analysis of the selected studies identifies a structure for the different semi-supervised learning models, and a scheme of their work process is obtained, it has been used to extract advantages, disadvantages, and performance metrics. Through a meta-analysis with forest diagrams, the classification accuracy performance of the researches in each learning model is evaluated, determining as results that regardless of the characteristics of its process, active learning (0.89) and assembled learning (0.83) present the best performance levels.",

We illustrate their use on artificial and real-world datasets and show that by varying the metric we can improve accuracy in classification tasks.",

This paper presents a general prediction model to hierarchical multi-label classification, where the attributes to be inferred can be specified as a strict poset. It is based on a top-down classification approach that addresses hierarchical multi-label classification with supervised learning by building a local classifier per class. The proposed model is showcased with a case study on the prediction of gene functions for Oryza sativa Japonica, a variety of rice. It is compared to the Hierarchical Binomial-Neighborhood, a probabilistic model, by evaluating both approaches in terms of prediction performance and computational cost. The results in this work support the working hypothesis that the proposed model can achieve good levels of prediction efficiency, while scaling up in relation to the state of the art.",

We develop a method that analyzes mechanisms of FOLFOX resistance and predicts whether a patient will benefit from FOLFOX.MethodsGene expression data of 83 stage IV CRC tumor samples (FOLFOX responder n=42, non-responder n=41) were used to develop a supervised learning method IML and analyze subgroups of FOLFOX resistance mechanism. Datasets of 32 FOLFOX treated stage IV CRC patients and 55 FOLFOX treated stage III CRC patients were used as independent validations.ResultsAn iterative supervised learning (IML) method identified two distinct subgroups of CRC patients who resist FOLFOX. Each subgroup relies on different types of DNA damage repair proteins and they are mutually exclusive. Protein-protein networks showed the main mechanism might be the synergistic effect of resisting apoptosis and an altered cell cycle. IML method was validated in two independent validation sets, one FOLFOX treated stage IV CRC patients(HR=2.6, p-value=0.02, 3-years survival rate of the predicted responder group 61.9%, predicted nonresponder group 18.8%) and one FOLFOX treated stage III CRC patients (estimated HR=2.36, p-value=0.02). A subgroup of mesenchymal subtype patients shows the pattern as FOLFOX responders.ConclusionsIML method reflects the underlying biology of FOLFOX resistance and predicts FOLFOX response.",

        "abstract": "AbstractPerforming quality control to detect image artifacts and data-processing errors is crucial in structural magnetic resonance imaging, especially in developmental studies. Currently, many studies rely on visual inspection by trained raters for quality control. The subjectivity of these manual procedures lessens comparability between studies, and with growing study sizes quality control is increasingly time consuming. In addition, both inter-rater as well as intra-rater variability of manual quality control is high and may lead to inclusion of poor quality scans and exclusion of scans of usable quality. In the current study we present the Qoala-T tool, which is an easy and free to use supervised-learning model to reduce rater bias and misclassification in manual quality control procedures. First, we manually rated quality of N = 784 FreeSurfer-processed T1-weighted scans. Different supervised-learning models were then compared to predict manual quality ratings. Results show that the Qoala-T tool using random forests is able to predict scan quality with both high sensitivity and specificity (mean area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98). In addition, the Qoala-T tool was also able to adequately predict the quality of a novel unseen dataset (N = 112; mean AUC = 0.95). These outcomes indicate that using Qoala-T in other datasets could greatly reduce the time needed for quality control. More importantly, this procedure could further help to reduce variability related to manual quality control, thereby benefiting the comparability of data quality between studies.",

        "abstract": "The increasing size of modern datasets combined with the difficulty of obtaining real label information (e.g., class) has made semi-supervised learning a problem of considerable practical importance in modern data analysis. Semi-supervised learning is supervised learning with additional information on the distribution of the examples or, simultaneously, an extension of unsupervised learning guided by some constraints. In this article we present a methodology that bridges between artificial neural network output vectors and logical constraints. In order to do this, we present a semantic loss function and a generalized entropy loss function (Rényi entropy) that capture how close the neural network is to satisfying the constraints on its output. Our methods are intended to be generally applicable and compatible with any feedforward neural network. Therefore, the semantic loss and generalized entropy loss are simply a regularization term that can be directly plugged into an existing loss function. We evaluate our methodology over an artificially simulated dataset and two commonly used benchmark datasets which are MNIST and Fashion-MNIST to assess the relation between the analyzed loss functions and the influence of the various input and tuning parameters on the classification accuracy. The experimental evaluation shows that both losses effectively guide the learner to achieve (near-) state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised multiclass classification.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nDeep learning models have shown great success in automating tasks in sleep medicine by learning from carefully annotated electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, effectively using a large amount of raw EEG data remains a challenge.\n\n\nObjective\nIn this study, we aim to learn robust vector representations from massive unlabeled EEG signals, such that the learned vectorized features (1) are expressive enough to replace the raw signals in the sleep staging task, and (2) provide better predictive performance than supervised models in scenarios involving fewer labels and noisy samples.\n\n\nMethods\nWe propose a self-supervised model, Contrast with the World Representation (ContraWR), for EEG signal representation learning. Unlike previous models that use a set of negative samples, our model uses global statistics (ie, the average representation) from the data set to distinguish signals associated with different sleep stages. The ContraWR model is evaluated on 3 real-world EEG data sets that include both settings: at-home and in-laboratory EEG recording.\n\n\nResults\nContraWR outperforms 4 recently reported self-supervised learning methods on the sleep staging task across 3 large EEG data sets. ContraWR also supersedes supervised learning when fewer training labels are available (eg, 4% accuracy improvement when less than 2% of data are labeled on the Sleep EDF data set). Moreover, the model provides informative, representative feature structures in 2D projection.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe show that ContraWR is robust to noise and can provide high-quality EEG representations for downstream prediction tasks. The proposed model can be generalized to other unsupervised physiological signal learning tasks. Future directions include exploring task-specific data augmentations and combining self-supervised methods with supervised methods, building upon the initial success of self-supervised learning reported in this study.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLaser Directed Energy Deposition (L-DED) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technology that offers unique advantages for creating and repairing metallic parts. The quality of the final print is highly dependent on the consistency of the printing parameters, and as a result, the deposited bead geometry along the printing pathway. Inconsistencies, particularly in the bead width, can produce defects between adjacent beads, increasing the material susceptibility to failure. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and predict the printing parameters in real-time during the process. The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the width of the deposited track in real-time. To achieve this, a dataset with approximately 12,379 melt pool images was used to train the algorithm and predict the width of the deposited track. Each one of the deposited track was measured by a profilometer at 10 points along the pathway, and intermediate labels were predicted using a spline curve, making the model semi-supervised. To implement the machine learning model, pre-trained frozen networks based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet were employed, using transfer learning principles. These networks were integrated into a dense, fully connected network containing trainable parameters. The results demonstrate a good model fit, with a mean absolute error of 4.5% and a mean absolute error of 0.0358 mm. Moreover, the processing frequency of the best model, at 55 Hz, enables real-time control of the L-DED manufacturing process. It is important to highlight, however, that the VGG based model shows a frequency of 250 Hz and similar results. Thus, accurately predicting the width of the deposited bead has the potential to significantly improve the quality of the final part by reducing overall defects, such as lack of fusion and porosity, whenever this data is used as input to a feed-back control system. This is particularly valuable in industries where mechanical properties and fatigue life are critical, such as automotive, aerospace, and biomedical sectors. The models developed in this study offer a promising approach to effectively provide data to control the L-DED manufacturing process in real-time, enabling the reliable production of high-quality components associated with reduced manufacturing costs.",

We use a spatiotemporal dataset of crimes in San Francisco, CA to demonstrate some of these strategies for crime analysis. We use classification models, namely, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Naive Bayes to predict crime types such as Larceny, Theft, etc. and propose model optimization strategies. Further, we use a graph based unsupervised machine learning technique called core periphery structures to analyze how crime behavior evolves over time. These methods can be generalized to use for different counties and can be greatly helpful in planning police task forces for law enforcement and crime prevention.",

        "abstract": "Data classification is a data mining task that consists of an algorithm adjusted by a training dataset that is used to predict an object’s class (unclassified) on analysis. A significant part of the performance of the classification algorithm depends on the dataset’s complexity and quality. Data Complexity involves the investigation of the effects of dimensionality, the overlap of descriptive attributes, and the classes’ separability. Data Quality focuses on the aspects such as noise data (outlier) and missing values. The factors Data Complexity and Data Quality are fundamental for the performance of classification. However, the literature has very few studies on the relationship between these factors and to highlight their significance. This paper applies Structural Equation Modeling and the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) algorithm and, in an innovative manner, associates Data Complexity and Data Quality contributions to Classification Quality. Experimental analysis with 178 datasets obtained from the OpenML repository showed that the control of complexity improves the classification results more than data quality does. Additionally paper also presents a visual tool of datasets analysis about the classification performance perspective in the dimensions proposed to represent the structural model.",

The model combines hydrological simulations as well as measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite missions. The efficiency of the high-resolution information is proved by closing the water balance equation in small basins while preserving large-scale accuracy inherited from the GRACE(-FO) measurements. The product contributes to monitoring natural hazards locally and shows potential for better understanding the impacts of natural and anthropogenic activities on the water cycle.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nUnderstanding the vertical discrete electrofacies distributions in wells is a vital step to preserve the reservoir heterogeneity. Predicting the electrofacies distribution at all wells is commonly conducted manually or with the use of some graphing approaches, but recently different machine learning techniques have been adopted to categorize electrofacies. In this paper, two supervised machine-learning techniques were implemented to model electrofacies given well logging data for a well in order to predict the distributions in all other wells (classification) in a carbonate reservoir in a giant southern Iraqi Oil Field.\nThe available data included open-hole and CPI well logging records in addition to the routine core analysis. The well discrete electrofacies distribution for the entire reservoir thickness has been obtained in our paper [OTC-29269-MS] using the Ward Hierarchical Clustering Analysis. For electrofacies classification, two supervised machine-learning techniques, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forests (RF), were adopted to model the resulting electrofacies given the CPI well logging data for a well to predict at other wells that have missing data. These two supervised learning techniques were implemented as non-linear and non-parametric classifiers, which are imperative attribute due to the non-linearity of the electrofacies properties and the geological reservoir control.\nThe results of this research illustrated that the reservoir electrofacies can be predicted through the use of the supervised learning techniques when well logging records and core data are available. The two adopted classification algorithms were analyzed and compared based on confusion table, transition probability matrix and total percent correct (TCP) of the identified electrofacies that reveal the accuracy of the classification. RF was observed to be the optimum approach as it led to better electrofacies classification in this carbonate reservoir than the KNN.\nThe application of supervised machine learning techniques enhanced the accuracy and reduced the time spent in electrofacies classification. The two machine learning algorithms were implemented by R software, the most powerful statistical programming language.",

        "abstract": "Autism appears to be a neuro developmental disorder that is visible in the early years. It is a wide-spectrum disorder that indicates that the severity and symptoms can vary from person to person. The Centre for Disease Control found that one in 68 was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with increasing numbers in every year. Detection of autism in adults is a cumbersome procedure because in adults, many symptoms can blend with some other mental health, motor impairment disorders so misinterpretation of actual diseases can in turn lead to a terrible life without proper diagnosis and effective treatment mechanisms. Machine learning is a powerful computer tool that supports different application domains Learning complex relationships or patterns from large datasets to draw accurate conclusions. Disease assessment can be done with predictive health data analysis and more appropriate treatment mechanisms that are now a hot area of research. Supervised learning is an important step of Machine learning which uses a rule-based approach by examining empirical data sets to build accurate predictive models. In this paper, decision tree, random forest, SVM, neural networks algorithms are applied on autism spectrum data which have been collected from UCI repository. The results of decision tree, random forest, SVM, neural networks algorithms on autism dataset are presented in this paper in an efficient manner. Analysis performed over these accurate results which will be useful to make right decisions in predicting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at early stages. Thus, early autism intervention using machine learning techniques opens up a new way for autistic individuals to develop the potential to lead a better life by improving their behavioural and emotional skills.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSupervised learning aims to build a function or model that seeks as many mappings as possible between the training data and outputs, where each training data will predict as a label to match its corresponding ground‐truth value. Although supervised learning has achieved great success in many tasks, sufficient data supervision for labels is not accessible in many domains because accurate data labelling is costly and laborious, particularly in medical image analysis. The cost of the dataset with ground‐truth labels is much higher than in other domains. Therefore, it is noteworthy to focus on weakly supervised learning for medical image analysis, as it is more applicable for practical applications. In this review, the authors give an overview of the latest process of weakly supervised learning in medical image analysis, including incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate supervision, and introduce the related works on different applications for medical image analysis. Related concepts are illustrated to help readers get an overview ranging from supervised to unsupervised learning within the scope of machine learning. Furthermore, the challenges and future works of weakly supervised learning in medical image analysis are discussed.",

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are able to learn from fewer labeled data points with the help of a large number of unlabeled data points. In this paper, we investigated the possibility of using clustering analysis to identify the underlying structure of the data space for SSL. A cluster-then-label method was proposed to identify high-density regions in the data space which were then used to help a supervised SVM in finding the decision boundary. We have compared our method with other supervised and semi-supervised state-of-the-art techniques using two different classification tasks applied to breast pathology datasets. We found that compared with other state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised methods, our SSL method is able to improve classification performance when a limited number of labeled data instances are made available. We also showed that it is important to examine the underlying distribution of the data space before applying SSL techniques to ensure semi-supervised learning assumptions are not violated by the data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractManual behavioral observations have been applied in both environment and laboratory experiments in order to analyze and quantify animal movement and behavior. Although these observations contributed tremendously to ecological and neuroscientific disciplines, there have been challenges and disadvantages following in their footsteps. They are not only time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone but they can also be subjective, which induces further difficulties in reproducing the results. Therefore, there is an ongoing endeavor towards automated behavioral analysis, which has also paved the way for open-source software approaches. Even though these approaches theoretically can be applied to different animal groups, the current applications are mostly focused on mammals, especially rodents. However, extending those applications to other vertebrates, such as birds, is advisable not only for extending species-specific knowledge but also for contributing to the larger evolutionary picture and the role of behavior within. Here we present an open-source software package as a possible initiation of bird behavior classification. It can analyze pose-estimation data generated by established deep-learning-based pose-estimation tools such as DeepLabCut for building supervised machine learning predictive classifiers for pigeon behaviors, which can be broadened to support other bird species as well. We show that by training different machine learning and deep learning architectures using multivariate time series data as input, an F1 score of 0.874 can be achieved for a set of seven distinct behaviors. In addition, an algorithm for further tuning the bias of the predictions towards either precision or recall is introduced, which allows tailoring the classifier to specific needs.",

Previous studies typically assume that for each instance, the full set of relevant labels associated with each training instance is given. In many applicationssuch as image annotation, however, it’s usually difficult to get the full label set for each instance and only a partial or even empty set of relevant labels is available. We call this kind of problem as \"semi-supervised weak-label learning\" problem. In this work we propose the SSWL (Semi-Supervised Weak-Label) method to address this problem. Both instance similarity and label similarity are considered for the complement of missing labels. Ensemble of multiple models are utilized to improve the robustness when label information is insufficient. We formulate the objective as a bi-convex optimization problem with an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm. Experiments validate the effectiveness of SSWL.\n      \n    ",

An Artificial Intelligence technique for this purpose is text classification, it for its application uses labels (previously categorized documents) with supervised (with labels) or unsupervised (without labels) training models. Both traditional models with their advantages and disadvantages have been joined into semi-supervised models that extract the best qualities of each one, however, the labeling process involves resources and time that try to be optimized to improve classification accuracy.\r\nAn analysis of the different semi-supervised models would show us the advantages of their training and the way how the structure of each of them affects the accuracy of their classification.

It is compared to the Hierarchical Binomial-Neighborhood, a probabilistic model, by evaluating both approaches in terms of prediction performance and computational cost.

Specifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference tokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the reference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with multi-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction tasks.

        "abstract": "AbstractEarly diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an important task that facilitates the development of treatment and prevention strategies and may potentially improve patient outcomes. Neuroimaging has shown great promise, including the amyloid-PET which measures the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain – a hallmark of AD. It is desirable to train end-to-end deep learning models to predict the progression of AD for individuals at early stages based on 3D amyloid-PET. However, commonly used models are trained in a fully supervised learning manner and they are inevitably biased toward the given label information. To this end, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to predict AD progression with 3D amyloid-PET. It uses unlabeled data to capture general representations underlying the images. As the downstream task is given as classification, unlike the general self-supervised learning problem that aims to generate task-agnostic representations, we also propose a loss function to utilize the label information in the pre-training. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The results confirmed that the proposed method is capable of providing appropriate data representations, resulting in accurate classification.",

        "abstract": "Background: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an intense inflammatory process of the lungs. Most ARDS patients require mechanical ventilation (MV). Few studies have investigated the prediction of MV duration over time. We aimed at characterizing the best early scenario during the first two days in the intensive care unit (ICU) to predict MV duration after ARDS onset using supervised machine learning (ML) approaches. Methods: For model description, we extracted data from the first 3 ICU days after ARDS diagnosis from patients included in the publicly available MIMIC-III database. Disease progression was tracked along those 3 ICU days to assess lung severity according to Berlin criteria. Three robust supervised ML techniques were implemented using Python 3.7 (Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM); Random Forest (RF); and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for predicting MV duration. For external validation, we used the publicly available multicenter database eICU. Results: A total of 2466 and 5153 patients in MIMIC-III and eICU databases, respectively, received MV for >48 h. Median MV duration of extracted patients was 6.5 days (IQR 4.4–9.8 days) in MIMIC-III and 5.0 days (IQR 3.0–9.0 days) in eICU. LightGBM was the best model in predicting MV duration after ARDS onset in MIMIC-III with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.10–6.41 days, and it was externally validated in eICU with RMSE of 5.87–6.08 days. The best early prediction model was obtained with data captured in the 2nd day. Conclusions: Supervised ML can make early and accurate predictions of MV duration in ARDS after onset over time across ICUs. Supervised ML models might have important implications for optimizing ICU resource utilization and high acute cost reduction of MV.",

        "abstract": "Emotion recognition models using audio input data can enable the development of interactive systems with applications in mental healthcare, marketing, gaming, and social media analysis. While the field of affective computing using audio data is rich, a major barrier to achieve consistently high-performance models is the paucity of available training labels. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a family of methods which can learn despite a scarcity of supervised labels by predicting properties of the data itself. To understand the utility of self-supervised learning for audio-based emotion recognition, we have applied self-supervised learning pre-training to the classification of emotions from the CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU- MOSEI)’s acoustic data. Unlike prior papers that have experimented with raw acoustic data, our technique has been applied to encoded acoustic data with 74 parameters of distinctive audio features at discrete timesteps. Our model is first pre-trained to uncover the randomly masked timestamps of the acoustic data. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned using a small sample of annotated data. The performance of the final model is then evaluated via overall mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute error (MAE) per emotion, overall four-class accuracy, and four-class accuracy per emotion. These metrics are compared against a baseline deep learning model with an identical backbone architecture. We find that self-supervised learning consistently improves the performance of the model across all metrics, especially when the number of annotated data points in the fine-tuning step is small. Furthermore, we quantify the behaviors of the self-supervised model and its convergence as the amount of annotated data increases. This work characterizes the utility of self-supervised learning for affective computing, demonstrating that self-supervised learning is most useful when the number of training examples is small and that the effect is most pronounced for emotions which are easier to classify such as happy, sad, and angry. This work further demonstrates that self-supervised learning still improves performance when applied to the embedded feature representations rather than the traditional approach of pre-training on the raw input space.",

We present a simple non-invasive computational technique that, when coupled with experiments, has the potential for characterization of a wide range of biological tissues. The fundamental idea of our approach is to find a supervised learner that links the scattering pattern of a turbid sample to its thickness and scattering parameters. Once found, this supervised learner is employed in an inverse optimization problem for estimating the scattering parameters of a sample given its thickness and scattering pattern. Multi-response Gaussian processes are used for the supervised learning task and a simple setup is introduced to obtain the scattering pattern of a tissue sample. To increase the predictive power of the supervised learner, the scattering patterns are filtered, enriched by a regressor, and finally characterized with two parameters, namely, transmitted power and scaled Gaussian width. We computationally illustrate that our approach achieves errors of roughly 5% in predicting the scattering properties of many biological tissues. Our method has the potential to facilitate the characterization of tissues and fabrication of phantoms used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes over a wide range of optical spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. While it is relatively straightforward to automate the processing of lidar signals, it is more difficult to choose periods of \"good\" measurements to process. Groups use various ad hoc procedures involving either very simple (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio) or more complex procedures (e.g. Wing et al., 2018) to perform a task which is easy to train humans to perform but is time consuming. Here, we use machine learning techniques to train the machine to sort the measurements before processing. The presented methods is generic and can be applied to most lidars. We test the techniques using measurements from the Purple Crow Lidar (PCL) system located in London, Canada. The PCL has over 200,000 raw scans in Rayleigh and Raman channels available for classification. We classify raw (level-0) lidar measurements as \"clear\" sky scans with strong lidar returns, \"bad\" scans, and scans which are significantly influenced by clouds or aerosol loads. We examined different supervised machine learning algorithms including the random forest, the support vector machine, and the gradient boosting trees, all of which can successfully classify scans. The algorithms where trained using about 1500 scans for each PCL channel, selected randomly from different nights of measurements in different years. The success rate of identification, for all the channels is above 95 %. We also used the t-distributed Stochastic Embedding (t-SNE) method, which is an unsupervised algorithm, to cluster our lidar scans. Because the t-SNE is a data driven method in which no labelling of training set is needed, it is an attractive algorithm to find anomalies in lidar scans. The method has been tested on several nights of measurements from the PCL measurements.The t-SNE can successfully cluster the PCL data scans into meaningful categories. To demonstrate the use of the technique, we have used the algorithm to identify stratospheric aerosol layers due to wildfires.\n                        ",

We present a simple non-invasive computational technique that, when coupled with experiments, has the potential for characterization of a wide range of biological tissues. The fundamental idea of our approach is to find a supervised learner that links the scattering pattern of a turbid sample to its thickness and scattering parameters. Once found, this supervised learner is employed in an inverse optimization problem for estimating the scattering parameters of a sample given its thickness and scattering pattern. Multi-response Gaussian processes are used for the supervised learning task and a simple setup is introduced to obtain the scattering pattern of a tissue sample. To increase the predictive power of the supervised learner, the scattering patterns are filtered, enriched by a regressor, and finally characterized with two parameters, namely, transmitted power and scaled Gaussian width. We computationally illustrate that our approach achieves errors of roughly 5% in predicting the scattering properties of many biological tissues. Our method has the potential to facilitate the characterization of tissues and fabrication of phantoms used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes over a wide range of optical spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Medical time series are sequential data collected over time that measures health-related signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and intensive care unit (ICU) readings. Analyzing medical time series and identifying the latent patterns and trends that lead to uncovering highly valuable insights for enhancing diagnosis, treatment, risk assessment, and disease progression. However, data mining in medical time series is heavily limited by the sample annotation which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and expert-depending. To mitigate this challenge, the emerging self-supervised contrastive learning, which has shown great success since 2020, is a promising solution. Contrastive learning aims to learn representative embeddings by contrasting positive and negative samples without the requirement for explicit labels. Here, we conducted a systematic review of how contrastive learning alleviates the label scarcity in medical time series based on PRISMA standards. We searched the studies in five scientific databases (IEEE, ACM, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed) and retrieved 1908 papers based on the inclusion criteria. After applying excluding criteria, and screening at title, abstract, and full text levels, we carefully reviewed 43 papers in this area. Specifically, this paper outlines the pipeline of contrastive learning, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and testing. We provide a comprehensive summary of the various augmentations applied to medical time series data, the architectures of pre-training encoders, the types of fine-tuning classifiers and clusters, and the popular contrastive loss functions. Moreover, we present an overview of the different data types used in medical time series, highlight the medical applications of interest, and provide a comprehensive table of 51 public datasets that have been utilized in this field. In addition, this paper will provide a discussion on the promising future scopes such as providing guidance for effective augmentation design, developing a unified framework for analyzing hierarchical time series, and investigating methods for processing multimodal data. Despite being in its early stages, self-supervised contrastive learning has shown great potential in overcoming the need for expert-created annotations in the research of medical time series.",

        "abstract": "While the advance of deep learning has allowed to automate many tasks in bioimage analysis, quantifying key visual features of biological objects in an image, such as cells, organs, or tissues, is still a multi-step and laborious task. It requires image segmentation and definition of features of interest, which often might be image- and problem-specific. This approach requires image labeling and training of the segmentation method as well as manual feature design and implementation of dedicated procedures for their quantification. Here we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to encoding in microscopy images morphological features of molecular structures that play role in disease phenotype and patient clinical diagnosis. We encode super-resolution images of slit diaphragm (SD)—a specialized membrane between podocyte cells in kidney—in a high-dimensional embedding space in an unsupervised manner, without the need of image segmentation and feature quantification. We inspect the embedding space and demonstrate its relationship to the morphometric parameters of the SD estimated with a previously published method. The SSL-derived image representations additionally reflect the level of albuminuria—a key marker of advancement of kidney disease in a cohort of chronic kidney disease patients. Finally, the embeddings allow for distinguishing mouse model of kidney disease from the healthy subjects with a comparable accuracy to classification based on SD morphometric features. In a one step and label-free manner the SSL approach offers possibility to encode meaningful details in biomedical images and allow for their exploratory, unsupervised analysis as well as further fine-tuning for specialized supervised tasks.",

Recent studies indicate that the usage of unlabeled data might even deteriorate performance. Although some proposals have been developed to alleviate such a fundamental challenge for semi-supervised classification, the efforts on semi-supervised regression (SSR) remain to be limited. In this work we consider the learning of a safe prediction from multiple semi-supervised regressors, which is not worse than a direct supervised learner with only labeled data. We cast it as a geometric projection issue with an efficient algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the proposal is provably safe and has already achieved the maximal performance gain, if the ground-truth label assignment is realized by a convex linear combination of base regressors. This provides insight to help understand safe SSR. Experimental results on a broad range of datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposal.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "\n      \n        Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most important noninvasive neuroimaging tools that provides excellent temporal accuracy. As the EEG electrode sensors measure electrical potentials on the scalp instead of direct measuring activities of brain voxels deep inside the head, many approaches are proposed to infer the activated brain regions due to its significance in neuroscience research and clinical application. However, since mostly part of the brain activity is composed of the spontaneous neural activities or non-task related activations, task related activation patterns will be corrupted in strong background signal/noises. In our research, we proposed a sparse learning framework for solving EEG inverse problem which aims to explicitly extract the discriminative sources for different cognitive tasks by fusing the label information into the inverse model. The proposed framework is capable of estimation the discriminative brain sources under given different brain states where traditional inverse methods failed. We introduced two models, one is formulated as supervised sparse dictionary learning and the other one is the graph regularized discriminative source estimation model to promote the consistency within same class. Preliminary experimental results also validated that the proposed sparse learning framework is effective to discover the discriminative task-related brain activation sources, which shows the potential to advance the high resolution EEG source analysis for real-time non-invasive brain imaging research.\n      \n    ",

        "abstract": "Leading trends in multimodal deep learning for visual-question answering include Multimodal joint-embedding model, multimodal attention-based model, and multimodal external knowledge-based model. Several mechanisms and strategies are used in these models, including representation fusion methods, co-attention mechanisms, and knowledge base retrieval mechanisms. While a variety of works have comprehensively reviewed these strategies, a key gap in research is that there is no interdisciplinary analysis that connects these mechanisms with discoveries on human. As discussions of Neuro-AI continues to thrive, it is important to consider synergies among human level investigations and ANNs, specifically for using AI to reproduce higher order cognitive functions such as multisensory integration. Thus, Present meta-analysis aimed at the reviewing and connecting neurophysiological and psychophysical references to trends in VQA multimodal deep learning, focusing on 1) Providing back-up explanations for why several strategies in VQA MMDL leads to performances that are closer to human level and 2) Using VQA MMDL as an example to demonstrate how interdisciplinary perspective may foster the development of human level AI. The result of the meta-analysis builds connections between several sub-fields: Joint embedding mechanisms and SC neurons, multimodal attention mechanism and the retro-cue effect, and external knowledge base and engram mechanisms.

        "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning has made remarkable achievements in the self-supervised representation learning of graph-structured data. By employing perturbation function (i.e., perturbation on the nodes or edges of graph), most graph contrastive learning methods construct contrastive samples on the original graph. However, the perturbation based data augmentation methods randomly change the inherent information (e.g., attributes or structures) of the graph. Therefore, after nodes embedding on the perturbed graph, we cannot guarantee the validity of the contrastive samples as well as the learned performance of graph contrastive learning. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel generation based multi-view contrastive learning framework (GMVC) for self-supervised graph representation learning, which generates the contrastive samples based on our generator rather than perturbation function. Specifically, after nodes embedding on original graph we first employ random walk in the neighborhood to develop multiple relevant node sequences for each anchor node. We then utilize the transformer to generate the representations of relevant contrastive samples of anchor node based on the features and structures of the sampled node sequences. Finally, by maximizing the consistency between the anchor view and the generated views, we force the model to effectively encode graph information into nodes embeddings. We perform extensive experiments of node classification and link prediction tasks on eight benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our generation based multi-view graph contrastive learning method.",

        "abstract": "No studies have examined the immune fingerprint of major neuro-cognitive psychosis (MNP) or deficit schizophrenia using M1 macrophage cytokines in combination with chemokines such as CCL-2 and CCL-11. The present study delineated the neuro-immune fingerprint of MNP/deficit schizophrenia by analyzing plasma levels of IL-1&beta;, sIL-1RA, TNF-&alpha;, sTNFR1, sTNFR2, CCL-2 and CCL-11 in MNP (n=120) versus healthy controls (n=54) in association with neurocognitive deficits (as assessed with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia) and PHEMN (psychotic, hostility, excitation, mannerism and negative) symptoms. All immune biomarkers were significantly higher in MNP than in normal controls. MNP was best predicted by a combination of CCL-11, TNF-&alpha;, IL-1&beta; and sIL-1RA which yielded a bootstrapped (n=2000) area under the Receiver Operating Curve of 0.985. Composite scores reflecting M1 macrophage activity and neurotoxic potential including combined effects of CCL-11 plus CCL-2 were significantly increased in MNP. Nevertheless, the effects of increased IL-1&beta; and TNF-&alpha; in MNP were attenuated (statistically) by increased sIL-1RA and sTNFR2, two negative immune-regulatory markers. A large part of the variance in PHEM (38.4%-52.6%) and negative (65.8-7439%) symptoms was explained by combinations of immune markers whereby CCL-11 was consistently the most important. The immune markers also explained a large part of the variance in the Mini Mental State examination, list learning, digit sequencing task, category instances, controlled word association, symbol coding and Tower of London. Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy performed on the biomarkers showed that the inter-class distance between the models constructed around MNP and controls was 19.3 indicating a good separation. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that 72.7% of the variance in overall phenomenology was explained by the regression on IL-1&beta;, sIL-1RA, CCL-11, TNF-&alpha; (all positively) and education (inversely). It is concluded that the combination of the above-mentioned markers defines MNP as a distinct neuro-immune disorder and that those markers in combination explain a large part of the variance in memory and executivive impairments and PHEMN symptoms.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundGlobal life expectancy has been increasing without a corresponding increase in health span and with greater risk for aging-associated diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An urgent need to delay the onset of aging-associated diseases has arisen and a dramatic increase in the number of potential molecular targets has led to the challenge of prioritizing targets to promote successful aging. Here, we developed a pipeline to prioritize aging-related genes which integrates the plethora of publicly available genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and morphological data of C. elegans by applying a supervised machine learning approach. Additionally, a unique biological post-processing analysis of the computational output was performed to better reveal the prioritized gene’s function within the context of pathways and processes involved in aging across the lifespan of C. elegans.ResultsFour known aging-related genes — daf-2, involved in insulin signaling; let-363 and rsks-1, involved in mTOR signaling; age-1, involved in PI3 kinase signaling — were present in the top 10% of 4380 ranked genes related to different markers of cellular dysfunction, validating the computational output. Further, our ranked output showed that 91% of the top 438 ranked genes consisted of known genes on GenAge, while the remaining genes had thus far not yet been associated with aging-related processes.ConclusionThese ranked genes can be translated to known human orthologs potentially uncovering previously unknown information about the basic aging processes in humans. These genes (and their downstream pathways) could also serve as targets against aging-related diseases, such as AD.",

        "abstract": "<p>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems are widely used for energy management, but their accuracy can be limited by the removal of monitoring equipment after the initial training phase. This removal results in a lack of ongoing training data and impairs the ability to improve recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this research proposes a novel semi-supervised learning approach for NILM systems. The approach is based on a previously proposed temporal convolutional network-conditional random field (TCN-CRF) model. It uses optimal interval filtering and unanimous voting to control the quality of pseudo-labels. The approach identifies high-precision segments in the sequence-to-sequence algorithm as semi-supervised learning targets and generates pseudo-labels, allowing for continuous self-supervised learning and sustained improvement in recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can effectively combine unlabeled data to improve model accuracy, and achieve up to 14% highest improvement in algorithm accuracy over fully self-supervised methods in small sample training.</p>",

        "abstract": "AbstractExamination of rodent vocalizations in experimental conditions can yield valuable insights into how disease manifests and progresses over time. It can also be used as an index of social interest, motivation, emotional development or motor function depending on the animal model under investigation. Most mouse communication is produced in ultrasonic frequencies beyond human hearing. These ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) are typically described and evaluated using expert defined classification of the spectrographic appearance or simplistic acoustic metrics resulting in nine call types. In this study, we aimed to replicate the standard expert-defined call types of communicative vocal behavior in mice by using acoustic analysis to characterize USVs and a principled supervised learning setup. We used four feature selection algorithms to select parsimonious subsets with maximum predictive accuracy, which are then presented into support vector machines (SVM) and random forests (RF). We assessed the resulting models using 10-fold cross-validation with 100 repetitions for statistical confidence and found that a parsimonious subset of 8 acoustic measures presented to RF led to 85% correct out-of-sample classification, replicating the experts’ labels. Acoustic measures can be used by labs to describe USVs and compare data between groups, and provide insight into vocal-behavioral patterns of mice by automating the process on matching the experts’ call types.",
