        "abstract": "Decision trees remain one of the most popular machine learning models today, largely due to their out-of-the-box performance and interpretability. In this work, we present a Bayesian approach to decision tree induction via maximum a posteriori inference of a posterior distribution over trees. We first demonstrate a connection between maximum a posteriori inference of decision trees and AND/OR search. Using this connection, we propose an AND/OR search algorithm, dubbed MAPTree, which is able to recover the maximum a posteriori tree. Lastly, we demonstrate the empirical performance of the maximum a posteriori tree both on synthetic data and in real world settings. On 16 real world datasets, MAPTree either outperforms baselines or demonstrates comparable performance but with much smaller trees. On a synthetic dataset, MAPTree also demonstrates greater robustness to noise and better generalization than existing approaches. Finally, MAPTree recovers the maxiumum a posteriori tree faster than existing sampling approaches and, in contrast with those algorithms, is able to provide a certificate of optimality. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/ThrunGroup/maptree.",

However, there is currently no publicly available chatbot for patients and care providers to determine the potential severity of a COVID-19 infection or the possible biological system responses and comorbidities that can contribute to the development of severe cases of COVID-19. This preliminary investigation assesses this lack of a COVID-19 case-by-case chatbot into consideration when building a decision tree with binary classification that was stratified by age and body system, viral infection, comorbidities, and any manifestations. After reviewing the relevant literature, a decision tree was constructed using a suite of tools to build a stratified framework for a chatbot application and interaction with users. A total of 212 nodes were established that were stratified from lung to heart conditions along body systems, medical conditions, comorbidities, and relevant manifestations described in the literature. This resulted in a possible 63,360 scenarios, offering a method toward understanding the data needed to validate the decision tree and highlighting the complicated nature of severe cases of COVID-19. The decision tree confirms that stratification of the viral infection with the body system while incorporating comorbidities and manifestations strengthens the framework. Despite limitations of a viable clinical decision tree for COVID-19 cases, this prototype application provides insight into the type of data required for effective decision support.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDecision trees have been used for many years in conventional oil and gas plays to help managers better understand risk and expected value for a project. Although industry has rapidly shifted over the past decade to developing unconventional resources, application of decision trees to these plays has lagged behind. When building decision trees for unconventional plays, it is often unclear to evaluators how to build the tree, namely, how to estimate the probability of meeting a given commercial threshold, as well as the production profiles and costs to use for each branch of the tree. This paper presents a workflow that can be used to build a decision tree for an unconventional play in the appraisal phase of development, given ranges of uncertainty in production profiles and drilling and completion costs. In applying this workflow, managers will better understand both the drivers of uncertainty in expected value and how they can influence it via appraisal program design and setting commercial thresholds. An example from a North American unconventional play is used as an example to illustrate the steps of the workflow.",

The hypothesis is that certain Compustat variables will be most used by the decision tree program and will provide insight as to how to make investing decisions. Surprisingly, the authors' experiments show that the most frequently used variables come from the International Monetary Fund and that variables provided exclusively for Financial Industry stocks were not useful for forecasting financial stock performance. These experiments might be part of a constellation of such experiments that help people map financial forecasting problems to the variables most useful for solving those problems. The research shows the value of using decision tree methodologies as applied to finance.",

        "abstract": "Coffee is one of the main plant-based goods consumed today, as well as the second most traded commodity in the modern economy after oil. Its production takes place mostly in developing countries such as Colombia, where a malfunction during the process could affect thousands of coffee farmers. Coffee rust does just that, reducing the quality and quantity of grains devastating entire productions yearly. One of the most effective ways to prevent this disease from spreading is early detection, which makes effective the extraction and replacement of withered crops. Using wireless sensor networks, it is possible to obtain data from each plant’s conditions; which allows us to determine whether a specific plant is in the early stages of infection or perfectly healthy. Serving this purpose, a data mining and machine learning concept called decision trees was implemented. With the help of one of these alone, we were able to correctly classify 79% of the plants that were studied. In search of a better result, a new method was used; one called random forest where multiple trees are built and the most common result is taken as the final one.",
