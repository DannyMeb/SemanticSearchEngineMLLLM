        "abstract": "Many combined heat and power (CHP) energy hubs work within the following heat load mode in the wintertime to supply the request for heat, and renewable energy has been often restricted in the unified energy network (UEN) markets. The power Internet of Things (PIoTs) has enabled UEN to transmit data increasingly frequently. As a result of flexible connections among various UEN networks, renewable energy increases its accommodation capacity considerably. Thus, the purpose of the study is to optimize UEN within the backdrop of PIoTs. According to the impact of PIoTs on UEN, this paper develops the combined demand response (DR) process and the layout of the important parts of UEN. Afterward, this study develops a bi-level economic dispatching process based on the cyber-physical systems of PIoTs and UEN. In the dispatching process, the higher level optimizes the total UEN function; the lower level optimizes the demand-side equipment output and combined DR. Then, the gray wolf optimization scheme is used to solve the bi-level dispatch. Lastly, the standard UEN and the practical network have been used to verify the efficiency of the suggested process.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Literature suggests large data is a competitive advantage, and that features a firm 's general performance. With all the rise of big data (BD), e- commerce companies are making use of the resources to interact with much more with clients, provide much better items, moreover innovate far more to obtain a competitive edge. Nevertheless, past empirical studies show conflicting results. Design: Building on the capital based viewpoint as well as the firm 's inertia idea, we made a model to enjoy how BD as well as BD analytics capability influence innovation leads to e commerce companies. We completed a two year empirical investigation project to secure empirical data on 1703 data driven innovation duties from Asia and USA. Findings: We demonstrated that there's a tradeoff among BD as well as BD analytics capability, in that the maximum harmony of BD depends upon the quantity of BD analytics skill. BD analytics ability exerts a very good moderating impact, that's, the greater this capability is, the taller the outcome of BD on gross sales and margin growth. For U.S. development tasks, BD comes with an inverted U shaped connection with sales innovation. For Asian development responsibilities, when main details capital is very little, advertising big data analytics capability betters disgusting margin and sales innovation as much as a certain issue. Policy Implications: Establishing BD analytics capability with that time might stop development effectiveness. Our results provide instruction to e- commerce firms on creating strategic options regarding supply allocations for BD as well as BD analytics skill. Originality: A small investigation is performed to show the effect of utilizing BD analytics tools to push innovation. This's among the very first articles which dive into utilizing BD to foster development in the e-commerce industry.",

        "abstract": "PurposeOne of the best ways to assist China is through infrastructure investment. China might become more resilient to natural calamities by pouring more money into its transport network. Analyzing the relationship between China's degree of planned expansion and the country's current network of transport hubs can help with city development estimates. A wide range of factors were taken into consideration while evaluating China's dominance and the caliber of its transportation infrastructure. Using a geographical autocorrelation model and a coupling coordination model, the dynamic link between China's adaptability and the caliber of its transportation infrastructure is examined.Design/methodology/approachChina's northwest is underdeveloped in comparison to the southeast, which has a high level of resilience and development of its transportation infrastructure. The relationship between the levels of resilience upheld by China's transport infrastructure is suggested to be coordinated.FindingsThe authors find a positive geographical autocorrelation between the degree of coupling coordination and the degree of agglomeration, despite the fact that the distance between cities increases with time. They now believe that there is a connection between an area's population density and the degree of interspousal cooperation within. The consequence is an improvement in both national security and economic prosperity. The facilities for disaster management and transportation in China have received several proposals for improvement.Practical implicationsThe authors' Practical Implications suggests that scale inefficiency is a major contributor to the relatively poor efficiency of China's primary inland river ports. Different types of inland river ports may have vastly different water system efficiencies. Input and output congestion at China's important interior river ports has reached 51%, making it very clear that massive amounts of valuable port resources are being wasted.Originality/valueMany variables, such as climate and human error, affect the total amount of goods that can be moved via inner river ports. Ports situated either higher up or lower down the same canal may perform better or worse, respectively, depending on the circumstances.",

        "abstract": "Recently, peoples’ awareness of online purchases has significantly risen. This has given rise to online retail platforms and the need for a better understanding of customer purchasing behaviour. Retail companies are pressed with the need to deal with a high volume of customer purchases, which requires sophisticated approaches to perform more accurate and efficient customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is a marketing analytical tool that aids customer-centric service and thus enhances profitability. In this paper, we aim to develop a customer segmentation model to improve decision-making processes in the retail market industry. To achieve this, we employed a UK-based online retail dataset obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The retail dataset consists of 541,909 customer records and eight features. Our study adopted the RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary) framework to quantify customer values. Thereafter, we compared several state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering algorithms, namely, K-means clustering, the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), agglomerative clustering, and balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH). The results showed the GMM outperformed other approaches, with a Silhouette Score of 0.80.",

        "abstract": "The progressive move of higher education institutions (HEIs) towards blended and online environments, accelerated by COVID-19, and their access to a greater variety of student data has heightened the need for ethical learning analytics (LA). This need is particularly salient in light of a lack of comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines on ethics that address gaps voiced in LA ethics research. Studies on the topic are predominantly conceptual, representing mainly institutional rather than stakeholder views, with some areas of ethics remaining underexplored. In this paper, we address this need by using a case of four years of interdisciplinary research in developing the award-winning Early Alerts Indicators (EAI) dashboard at a distance learning university. Through a lens focused on ethical considerations and informed by the practical approach to ethics, we conducted a case study review, using 10 relevant publications that report on the development and implementation of the tool. Our six practical recommendations on how to ethically engage with LA can inform an ethical development of LA that not only protects student privacy, but also ensures that LA tools are used in ways that effectively support student learning and development.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Textile and contemporary apparel manufacturers are adopting and integrating cutting-edge technologies to reduce their impact on the environment and gain an advantage in the marketplace. Most previous studies have ignored business intelligence systems (BIS), notably in the textile and apparel industry (T&A), in favor of looking at the larger picture of how big data would affect retail and distribution in a company. This is especially true for the T&As.Design/methodology/approach The authors report that they conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with 12 international luxury tourism service providers. In this case, researchers use snowball features and systematic techniques to select participants. A qualitative content analysis strategy is used to capture the focus of the interviews.Findings Problems with T&A company sustainability, opportunities to increase value creation via use of industry-leading business intelligence (BI) solutions and perceived roadblocks to BIS adoption were all found by the poll. Garment retail and distribution sector has benefited greatly from the increased use of Industry 4.0 technologies, especially those that provide better BI solutions. Determine the extent to which industry participation slows down or speeds up the process. The Company Information System (BIS) will help convince non-tech-savvy business owners of the financial, economic and environmental benefits of adopting certain technologies developed as part of the industry 4.0 movement.Research limitations/implications The authors of this research claim theirs is one of the first to investigate what variables affect the uptake of BIS, ultimately hoping to find out how BIS may be used by T&A businesses to tackle environmental issues through the use of Industry 4.0 technologies. The purpose of this study was to see whether BIS might aid T&A firms with their sustainability issues.Practical implications In the last several years, there has been a meteoric rise in interest in big data and business analytics among firms and educational institutions alike. This paper tries to introduce readers to the concept of business analytics in a way that is both academic and accessible, considering both the present and future of the field. This paper begins with a quick introduction, followed by a summary of the three distinct forms of predictive modeling discussed.Originality/value In an effort to help aspiring analytics professionals, they have identified, categorized and evaluated the nine distinct players that are now active in the analytics market. Following this, they will provide a high-level summary of the many different research projects currently being worked on by their group.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nOil & Gas is a data-rich industry which is prime for data-driven and decision making. The significant growth witnessed in the digital transformation field and the new era of the industrial revolution 4 (IR 4.0), is a direct result of the need within the industry to utilize the large amount of data to make better decisions, improve operation strategy, plan better for preventive maintenance (PM), and process improvement.\nThe uncertainty associated with estimating the incoming feed gas rate to NGL plants has resulted in deviation from optimal compressor recycle rate, missed opportunities of meeting planned PM and imposed urgency during operation. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, namely regression and decision tree model, the incoming feed gas can be predicted which result in the machine learning algorithms which results in the identification of the optimum number of running trains and recycle rate required for efficient operation.\nNGL-Operation Planner (NGL-OP) is the outcome of utilizing ML algorithms which provides the ability of predicting incoming feed gas, identifying optimum number of running trains required as well as estimating the optimal recycle rate. Adopting this approach is a new and strategical way to plan NGL operation. The developed tool also has the ability to advise whether to shut down, maintain existing operation or starting-up a new train.\nThe implementation of the model resulted in a significant improvement in NGL operation. The improvement includes fuel gas consumption reduction of around 449 MMSCF/Year which resulted in a significant cost saving, reduction in emissions around 27 M tons/year, and 10% reduction in operating unnecessary running trains. These savings have been achieved through the utilization of the NGL-OP to minimize uncertainty and improve our planning strategy.",

        "abstract": "The construction of prediction models reflecting players’ learning performance in serious games currently faces various challenges for learning analytics. In this study, we design, implement, and field test a learning analytics system for a serious game, advancing the field by explicitly showing which in-game features correspond to differences in learner performance. We then deploy and test a system that provides instructors with clear signals regarding student learning and progress in the game, which instructors could depend upon for interventions. Within the study, we examined, coded, and filtered a substantial gameplay corpus, determining expertise in the game. Mission HydroSci (MHS) is a serious game that teaches middle-school students water science. Using our logging system, designed and implemented along with game design and development, we captured around 60 in-game features from the gameplay of 373 students who completed Unit 3 of MHS in its first field test. We tested eight hypotheses during the field test and presented this paper’s results to participating teachers. Our findings reveal several features with statistical significance that will be critical for creating a validated prediction model. We discuss how this work will help future research establish a framework for designing analytics systems for serious games and advancing gaming design and analytics theory.",

        "abstract": "Environmental issues and sustainability performance are more and more significant in today’s business world. A growing number of manufacturing companies are searching for changes to improve their sustainability in the areas of products and manufacturing processes. These changes should be introduced in the design process and affect the whole product life cycle. This paper is concerned with developing a method based on predictive and prescriptive analytics to identify opportunities for increasing sustainable manufacturing through changes incorporated at the product design stage. Predictive analytics uses parametric models obtained from regression analysis and artificial neural networks in order to predict sustainability performance. In turn, prescriptive analytics refers to the identification of opportunities for improving sustainability performance in manufacturing, and it is based on a constraint programming implemented within a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The specification of sustainability performance in terms of a CSP provides a pertinent framework for identifying all admissible solutions (if there are any) of the considered problem. The identified opportunities for improving sustainability performance are dedicated to specialists in product development, and aim to reduce both resources used in manufacturing and negative effects on the environment. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated through reducing the number of defective products in manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA significant body of recent research in the field of Learning Analytics has focused on leveraging machine learning approaches for predicting at-risk students in order to initiate timely interventions and thereby elevate retention and completion rates. The overarching feature of the majority of these research studies has been on the science of prediction only. The component of predictive analytics concerned with interpreting the internals of the models and explaining their predictions for individual cases to stakeholders has largely been neglected. Additionally, works that attempt to employ data-driven prescriptive analytics to automatically generate evidence-based remedial advice for at-risk learners are in their infancy. eXplainable AI is a field that has recently emerged providing cutting-edge tools which support transparent predictive analytics and techniques for generating tailored advice for at-risk students. This study proposes a novel framework that unifies both transparent machine learning as well as techniques for enabling prescriptive analytics, while integrating the latest advances in large language models for communicating the insights to learners. This work demonstrates a predictive modelling framework for identifying learners at risk of qualification non-completion based on a real-world dataset comprising $$\\sim $$\n∼\n7000 learners with their outcomes, covering 2018 - 2022. The study further demonstrates how predictive modelling can be augmented with prescriptive analytics on two case studies to generate human-readable prescriptive feedback for those who are at risk using ChatGPT.",

        "abstract": " The explosive growth of retail platforms over the past decade has resulted in a significant amount of customer and seller data that can be leveraged for advanced business analytics. As a result, the management of retail platforms with business analytics capabilities has garnered increased attention in the field of operations management. Despite the recognition of the importance of business analytics techniques for retail platforms, a systematic study of their operations is lacking in the literature. Based on our observations of the industrial practice and understanding of the academic literature, we attempt to address this gap by proposing a framework that broadly categorizes retail platform management into three key themes: demand-side management, supply-side management, and matching. For each theme, we identify critical topics, discuss the current practices of platforms, and review relevant literature. We also propose future research questions with directions for the initial modeling and solution strategy, together with applicable data sources and potential insights. At last, to facilitate future research, we provide a roadmap and datasets for further exploration of business analytics applications of retail platforms. Overall, this paper lays a strong foundation for researchers to delve deeper into the exciting and constantly evolving field of retail platform analytics. ",

        "abstract": " This study examines the impact of the morphological characteristics of plots in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) on the retail landscape, with a focus on understanding the ways in which the morphological characteristics potentially influence the distribution, agglomeration and diversity of retail businesses. Although frequently underestimated in contemporary placemaking practices, this research emphasizes the role of the dual nature of plots as an element of urban form and an element of control over the retail landscape of the city. In this sense, the role of the morphological characteristics of plots in shaping the retail landscape of the city was investigated. The compositional (size, frontage ratio) and configurational (integration, betweenness, frequency) features of the plot in the HMA ( n = 77,736) were measured. Thereafter an unsupervised two-step clustering method was applied to reveal the subtle morphological regions through plot patterns. Computational plot characterization with open data sets yielded six plot types having different morphological characteristics and geographic distribution patterns. The spatial capacities of each plot type for retail distribution, agglomeration and diversity were then analysed and compared. This research argues that the interrelationship of the dual nature of plot plays an important role in placemaking processes. The results suggest that the spatial capacity of plots to accommodate street-based retail clusters is improved with spatially integrated, fine-grained urban fabric with independent micro-businesses involving a diversity of uses and actors. The study argues that these spatial conditions might also increase retail resilience and contribute to the vitality and viability of the retail landscape. ",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Improving the operation of a commercial enterprise is an integral task of a growing business. In modern conditions of rapid global technological growth, systems of analysis and statistics come out on top in terms of efficiency. The introduction of a business management system through marketing and predictive analysis will allow you to stand out in a competitive environment and make the company more sustainable and competitive. The solutions currently available cannot solve the emerging business problems. These software solutions are often complex, require large amounts of raw data, and end up producing questionable statistics that cannot be further applied. Therefore, the whole business is faced with the task of finding and implementing simple but really working methods of analyzing activities and managing the development of an enterprise.\r\nMETHODS. It is proposed to use a business management system through marketing and analytics. Changes in the hierarchy of the enterprise will allow to unite all structural divisions with a single link, which will help to coordinate and direct the entire business as a whole. The next qualitative change should be called the introduction of a predictive analytics system, which will allow making decisions accurately and on time. Particular importance should be attached to predictive analysis using the SALSA method. The simplicity and adaptability of this method of analysis will allow it to be implemented not only in large, but also in medium and small enterprises.\r\nFINDINGS. It is proposed to present the results of predictive analysis in a simple and understandable form to ensure clarity, comparability and the ability to quickly make the right strategic decisions. To improve the competitiveness of companies, it is proposed to change the structure of the business hierarchy and manage departments using statistical and analytical data obtained by the marketing department.\r\nCONCLUSION. Accurate data and strong interconnection of all departments in the company will be able to ensure stable operation, reduce costs, increase margins and competitiveness of the company. The introduction of a management system based on predictive analysis will help to avoid critical points in the work of the enterprise and respond in time to changes in the internal and external environment. High efficiency of work will help to enter new markets not only in Ukraine but also abroad.\r\nKEYWORDS: marketing; predictive analytics; business management; business efficiency.",

ADNOC Onshore also operates vast pipeline network through which oil is transported from the oil fields to export terminals.\nRotating equipment used in the oil and gas business are the heart of production and processing plants. Rotating equipment are used to mobilize oil and gas throughout the process units to achieve desired production targets. Therefore, maintaining the equipment's reliability with high availability is imperative. The rotating equipment needs to be maintained and operated in a manner that continuous oil/gas production is achieved.\nAny unwanted disruption with the equipment may result in issues like production and revenue loss, process safety concerns, environmental concerns, machine health and availability issues. Therefore, continuous condition monitoring and preventive maintenance of equipment is a key driver for minimizing abrupt equipment downtimes.\nDue to ongoing strategical initiatives of production sustainability and enhancement, the mandate on production critical rotating equipment availability is also growing. It became imperative to predict machine failures in advance to take proactive mitigative actions. ADNOC Onshore collaborated with parent company ADNOC Upstream to deploy machine learning based CPAD solution coupled with thermodynamics first principles, for major rotating equipment condition monitoring across ADNOC Onshore assets while capitalizing on IT-OT existing infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing tendency for more companies to develop towards a subscription business model. Under such a trend, it is important to learn about the customer churn rate within the business, learn from it and adjust business strategies accordingly. This paper aims to predict customer churn rate in subscription business models using a variety of machine learning algorithms. Through comparing the results from the different algorithms, the best algorithms can be identified so that it provides an insight on which algorithm a subscription business should choose in order to predict customer churn most effectively. In this work, a total of 21 features and 9 algorithms are taken into account. Through a set of rigorous procedure including data preparation, feature engineering, feature selection, model building, and finally, model evaluation, three algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting (SMOTE) and Neural Network outperformed other 6 algorithms. The best performing algorithm being Logistic Regression with its 79.6% prediction accuracy, thus the conclusion that when subscription business predicts customer churn rate, Logistic Regression is the most preferable algorithm. During the process of feature engineering, SMOTE did not improve the model performance as it supposed to, so it is not recommended during the model building process.",

        "abstract": "Predictive learning analytics has been widely explored in educational research to improve student retention and academic success in an introductory programming course in computer science (CS1). General-purpose and interpretable dropout predictions still pose a challenge. Our study aims to reproduce and extend the data analysis of a privacy-first student pass–fail prediction approach proposed by Van Petegem and colleagues (2022) in a different CS1 course. Using student submission and self-report data, we investigated the reproducibility of the original approach, the effect of adding self-reports to the model, and the interpretability of the model features. The results showed that the original approach for student dropout prediction could be successfully reproduced in a different course context and that adding self-report data to the prediction model improved accuracy for the first four weeks. We also identified relevant features associated with dropout in the CS1 course, such as timely submission of tasks and iterative problem solving. When analyzing student behaviour, submission data and self-report data were found to complement each other. The results highlight the importance of transparency and generalizability in learning analytics and the need for future research to identify other factors beyond self-reported aptitude measures and student behaviour that can enhance dropout prediction.",

        "abstract": "As data size continues to grow, there has been a revolution in computational methods and statistics to process and analyze data into insight and knowledge. This change in the paradigm of analytical data from explicit to implicit raises the way to extract knowledge from data through a prospective approach to determine the value of new observations based on the structure of the relationship between input and output. Data preparation is a very important stage in predictive analytics. To run quality analytical data, data with good quality is needed in accordance with the criteria. Data quality plays an important role in strategic decision making and planning before the digital computer era. The main challenge faced is that raw data cannot be directly used for analysis. One problem that arises related to data quality is completeness. Missing data is one that often causes data to become incomplete. As a result, predictive analysis generated from these data becomes inaccurate. In this paper we will discuss the problems related to the quality of data in predictive analytics through a literature study from related research. In addition, challenges and directions that might occur in the predictive analytics domain with problems related to data quality will be presented.",

        "abstract": "Supply chain agility has become a key success factor for businesses trying to handle upheavals and uncertainty in today’s quickly changing business environment. Proactive risk reduction is essential for achieving this agility. To facilitate real-time risk prevention and improve agility, this research study proposes an innovative strategy that makes use of machine learning as well as predictive analytics approaches. Traditional supply chain risk management frequently uses post-event analysis as well as historical data, which restricts its ability to address real-time interruptions. This research, on the other hand, promotes a futuristic methodology that uses predictive analytics to foresee possible disruptions. Based on contextual and historical data, machine learning models can be trained to find patterns and correlations as well as anomalies that point to imminent dangers. Organizations can identify risks as they arise and take preventative measures by incorporating these models into a real-time monitoring system. This study examines numerous predictive analytics methods, showing how they can be used to spot supply chain risks. These methods include time series analysis and anomaly detection as well as natural language processing. Additionally, risk assessment models are continuously improved and optimized using machine learning algorithms, assuring their accuracy and adaptability in changing contexts. This research clarifies the symbiotic relationship among predictive analytics and machine learning as well as supply chain agility using a synthesis of theoretical discourse and practical evidence. Case studies from various sectors highlight the usefulness and advantages of the suggested strategy. The advantages of this novel technique include improved risk visibility and quicker response times as well as the capacity to quickly modify operations. The development of a holistic framework that incorporates predictive analytics and machine learning into risk management procedures, setting the path for real-time risk identification as well as mitigation, is one of the theoretical contributions. On the practical side, the case studies offered in this paper show the actual benefits as well as the adaptability of the proposed approach across a wide range of businesses.",

As a result, these machines are ready for predictive maintenance as part of Industry 4.0 services. The benefit of predictive maintenance is that it can significantly extend the life of machines. The integration of predictive maintenance into existing production environments faces challenges in terms of data understanding and data preparation for machines and legacy systems. Current AI frameworks lack adequate support for the ongoing task of data integration. In this context, adequate support means that the data analyst does not need to know the technical background of the pilot’s data sources in terms of data formats and schemas. It should be possible to perform data analyses without knowing the characteristics of the pilot’s specific data sources. The aim is to achieve a seamless integration of data as information for predictive maintenance. For this purpose, the developed data-sharing infrastructure enables automatic data acquisition and data integration for AI frameworks using interoperability methods. The evaluation, based on two pilot projects, shows that the step of data understanding and data preparation for predictive maintenance is simplified and that the solution is applicable for new pilot projects.",

Contextual concepts from previous literature have helped us understand how environmental changes impact BDA decision-making, as such: (i) SC maturity levels and connectivity affect BDA utilisation, (ii) connected SCs improve data accessibility and information exchange, (iii) the benefits of BDAs also affect adoption and (iv) outsourcing complex tasks to experts allows companies to focus on core businesses instead of investing in IT infrastructure.Research limitations/implicationsOutside the key findings listed, this study shows that there is no one-size-fits-it-all approach for use within all organisational settings. The proposed framework reveals that the perceived benefit of BDA is non-transferrable and requires top-level management support for successful implementation.Originality/valueThe existing literature focusses on the approaches to applying BDA in SC and logistics but fails to present a deep dive into retail outbound logistics activity. This study addresses the “how” and proposes a social-inclusive framework for a technology-enabled topic.",

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool to analyze student performance. To predict learning abilities of students and prescribing them a personalized learning curriculum, it is necessary to estimate their behavior to know about their weaknesses, strengths and help institutions to improve enrollment and retention. If it is possible for the teachers to predict in advance and prescribe ways to the at-risk and dropout students, they can plan more effectively to help them. We are describing in this paper various intelligent tutoring systems with Educational Data Mining, Predictive Learning Analytics, prediction of at-risk students at an earlier basis and how this prediction task is done.

The media and entertainment sector is one of the diverse sectors in the stock market. In the Indian stock market, Sensex and Nifty are the two indexes. The 2019 pandemic forced the movie theatres to shut down. As a result, distributors and film directors were not able to release their movies in theatres, and production also was stopped. Consequently, during the lockdown, people spent more time at home watching media. Resulting in a higher degree of media consumption.\n\n\nObjectives:\nThe objective of the research is to predict the performance of the media and entertainment company's stock prices using machine-learning techniques. Investors will be benefited by maximizing the profit and minimizing the loss.\n\n\nMethods:\nThe proposed stock prediction system is used to predict the stock values and find the accuracy of linear    \n   regression and logistic regression in machine learning algorithms for data science.\n\n\nResults:\nThe experiments are conducted for the media and entertainment stock price data using Machine-learning algorithms. Media stock prices are considered as the input dataset. The model has been developed using the daily frequency of stock prices with different attributes.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThus, the media and entertainment stocks are predicted using linear regression and logistic regression. Using the above techniques, stock prices are predicted accurately to maximize profits and minimize the loss for the investors.\n",

        "abstract": "Hospital readmissions can have serious consequences for both patients and healthcare providers. They can lead to increased healthcare costs, lower patient satisfaction, and negative health outcomes. When patients are readmitted to the hospital soon after being discharged, their risk of morbidity and mortality increases. Additionally, hospitals may face penalties for having too many readmissions. To address this issue, researchers are investigating the potential of using machine learning techniques to predict a patient’s risk for readmission and illness progression. A large dataset of electronic health records from a major hospital was analyzed, containing patient information on medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and personal characteristics. Several machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, were utilized to detect important risk factors and develop predictive models for re-hospitalization and disease progression.\r\nThe performance of each machine learning model was assessed by the researchers using diverse metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The study showed that machine learning techniques have the potential to improve patient outcomes by identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted interventions.\r\nThe paper presents a range of approaches to explore the factors that contribute to hospital readmissions and introduces a predictive model that employs machine learning algorithms to identify patients who are at a higher risk of readmission. The research involved patients who were admitted to a tertiary hospital, and the model’s effectiveness was assessed using several metrics. The article discusses the possible implications of the model for clinical practice and future research, emphasizing the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict hospital readmissions and enhance patient outcomes.[1]",

        "abstract": "From the perspective of both plaintiffs and defendants, the measurement of damages quantum is of the utmost importance. It is surprising to see this process left entirely to the court’s discretion, as quantum is traditionally considered a question of fact. Quantifying damages presents significant challenges due to the subjective nature of court discretion, leading to uncertainty for both plaintiffs and defendants. This research addresses this issue by examining difficult-to-quantify contract damages through empirical and comparative methodologies. Based on prior studies on French civil law and American common law, this empirical study involved quantitative analysis of various contract cases. Methodological advancements, including Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, facilitated automated extraction and analysis of key variables. With a focus on overcoming sample size limitations and enhancing accuracy, this study achieved a classification accuracy of over 85% for identified essential variables. The more recent integration of generative AI and Large Language Modeling marked significant progress in quantifying damages. I conclude with recommendations for sustainable management practices in this field.",

        "abstract": "Predictive analytics, as a cornerstone of data engineering, has witnessed a paradigm shift with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies. This abstract provides an overview of the key themes explored in the paper titled “Predictive Analytics in Data Engineering: An AI Approach.” The paper delves into the transformative impact of AI on predictive analytics within the domain of data engineering. Traditional predictive analytics often relied on statistical models and historical data patterns to forecast future trends. The advent of AI technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning, has revolutionized the predictive analytics landscape by enabling systems to autonomously learn and adapt from data. A central focus of the paper is the exploration of advanced AI algorithms in predictive analytics. Machine learning models, such as regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, are examined for their efficacy in predictive modeling tasks. Additionally, the integration of deep learning architectures, known for their ability to capture intricate patterns in large datasets, is explored for enhancing predictive accuracy. The convergence of predictive analytics and AI introduces a dynamic dimension to data engineering workflows. The paper outlines how AI-driven predictive analytics not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also automates feature extraction, identifies complex patterns, and adapts to evolving data structures. The synergy between AI and predictive analytics empowers data engineers to navigate the challenges posed by big data and unstructured datasets. Ethical considerations and interpretability in AI-driven predictive analytics are also scrutinized in the paper. As AI models become increasingly complex, ensuring transparency in decision-making processes and addressing biases are crucial for responsible deployment in real-world scenarios. The findings presented in this paper contribute to the evolving discourse on the integration of AI in predictive analytics within the realm of data engineering. By examining the practical implications, challenges, and ethical dimensions, the paper provides valuable insights for practitioners, researchers, and organizations aiming to harness the full potential of AI in predictive analytics to drive informed decision-making and innovation in data engineering workflows.",

        "abstract": " Sales managers are unlikely to reap the benefits of implementing predictive analytics applications when salespeople show aversion to or lack understanding of these applications. For managers, it is essential to understand which factors mitigate or exacerbate these challenges. This article investigates these factors by studying the implementation of an application that predicts customer churn. Using 9.7 million transactions from a business-to-business company, the authors develop a predictive model of customer churn, implement it in a field experiment, and study its treatment effects using causal forests. Furthermore, the authors manipulate one specific mitigation strategy proposed by prior literature: the fostering of users’ realistic expectations regarding the accuracy of an algorithm. The results show that the effectiveness of the churn prediction application strongly depends on customer characteristics (most importantly the predicted churn probability and prior revenue) and salesperson characteristics (technology perceptions, abilities, and selling orientations). Fostering realistic expectations improves the effectiveness of the churn prediction only under very specific circumstances. Two follow-up stimuli-based experiments conceptually replicate key results of the field study. Therefore, this article helps build theory on predictive sales analytics and provides specific guidance to managers aiming to increase their return on analytics investments. ",

But how can they measure their progress and drive these metrics? For 122,000 brands, we measure Amazon shoppers’ brand awareness, consideration, and purchases and test how they change with ad and retail actions. Furthermore, we compare these brands’ past media mix with the recommended allocation based on the model’s coefficients. We find that new product launches and upper-funnel retail media advertising are particularly effective for small brands. Medium-sized and large brands benefit most from lower-funnel advertising. For the funnel stages, all three metrics benefit from the number of new reviews, % discount, negative keywords, and geo-reach campaigns. These results are robust across different product categories, but we find notable differences in how upper- and middle-funnel ad products succeed in driving sales.",

        "abstract": "In the current digital era, understanding the role of Data Analytics Capabilities (DAC) in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems is essential for businesses seeking better decision-making. While DAC is acknowledged as a Critical Success Factor (CSF) for CRM systems, there is a gap in empirical evidence quantifying its effect on business profitability. This study aims to (1) present the conceptual foundation of the impact of DAC for CRM systems on marketing decisions and business profitability, and (2) empirically estimate the impact of integrating DAC on marketing performance and business profitability. Focusing on the retail sector, the study gathered 131 questionnaires from employees involved in CRM and DAC in Lebanon, and used the SPSS tool for data analysis. The research findings provide advanced empirical evidence of the importance of DAC as a CSF for CRM systems, alongside people, process, and technology dimensions. Results show that the integration of DAC represents a significant step forward in enhancing the effectiveness of CRM systems and achieving better business profitability. This study challenges the conventional understanding of technology's role in improving business outcomes, thus providing valuable theoretical and practical implications for organizations aiming to enhance their CRM systems.\n ",

The research compares different methodological approaches, including alternative algorithms and variations in model specifications. Additionally, we examine the impact of employing either a single model for all university programs or separate models per program. The performance of models with students grouped according to their position on the program study plan was also tested. The training datasets were explored with varying time series lengths (2, 4, 6, and 8 years) and the experiments use academic data from the University of Porto, spanning the academic years from 2012 to 2022. The algorithm that yielded the best results was XGBoost. The best predictions were obtained with models trained with two years of data, both with separate models for each program and with a single model. The findings highlight the potential of data mining approaches in predicting student dropout, offering valuable insights for higher education institutions aiming to improve student retention and success.",

        "abstract": " This paper studies an emerging subscription model called ship-then-shop. Leveraging its predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) capability, the ship-then-shop firm curates and ships a product to the consumer, after which the consumer shops (i.e., evaluates product fit and makes a purchase decision). The consumer first pays the up-front ship-then-shop subscription fee prior to observing product fit and then pays the product price afterward if the consumer decides to purchase. We investigate how the firm balances the subscription fee and product price to maximize its profit when consumers can showroom. A key finding is the ship-then-shop firm’s nonmonotonic surplus extraction strategy with respect to its prediction capability. As prediction capability increases, the firm first switches from ex ante to ex post surplus extraction (by lowering fees and raising prices). However, if the prediction capability increases further, the firm reverts to ex ante surplus extraction (by raising fees and capping prices). We also find that the ship-then-shop model is most profitable when (i) the prediction capability is advanced, (ii) the search friction in the market is large, or (iii) the product match potential is large. Finally, we show that the marginal return of AI capability on the firm’s profit decreases in search friction but increases in product match potential. Taken together, we provide managerially relevant insights to help guide the implementation of the innovative subscription model.  This paper was accepted by Dmitri Kuksov, marketing.

        "abstract": "Predictive analytics is seen as a way of identifying the risk of future problems in families. Integral to such automated predictive analysis is a shift in time frames that redraws the relationship between families and the state, to potentially intervene on an anticipatory basis of ‘what hasn’t happened but might’. In the process, human subjects are reformulated as disembodied objects of data-driven futures. The article explains this process and fills a significant gap in knowledge about parents’ views of this development. We draw on group and individual discussions with parents across Great Britain to consider their understanding of predictive analytics and how comfortable they are with it. Parents’ concerns focused on inaccuracies in the data used for prediction, the unfair risk of false positives and false negatives, the deterministic implications of the past predicting the future, and the disturbing potential of being positioned in what was a pre-problem space. We conclude with policy implications.",

The 2D porphyrin derivative sheets attracted interest due to their versatility and capacity to interact with other chemicals due to the existence of a core metal ion. Topological descriptors are employed as a predictive technique to determine the physical, chemical, and structural characteristics of molecules by considering the molecular structure of compounds as molecular graphs. This paper investigates the degree and degree sum based descriptors of some potential porphyrin derivative nanosheets, using the edge partition method. We also demonstrate a predictive model for analyzing the electrical conductance of porphyrin derivative nanosheets using degree and degree sum based topological descriptors. Furthermore, the Shannon’s information entropies of these porphyrin derivatives are investigated, and the HOMO-LUMO gap of these nanostructures is predicted using these entropy.",

        "abstract": "A primary challenge in hydropower industry is the ability to maintain cost-competitiveness, reliability, and security of hydropower assets through evolving power system contexts and aging of the fleet. Maintaining cost-effective and reliable operations under these conditions is expected to require new modernization and maintenance paradigms for changing contexts. Changes in existing practices for O&M will require an understanding of the current state and health of hydropower assets, and the impact of changing paradigms on asset health and reliability. The Hydropower Fleet Intelligence project is developing and evaluating standardized methodologies and analysis tools for data-driven asset reliability and management technologies for hydropower, leading to eventual predictive maintenance planning, repair/replacement decision making, and asset-reliability and cost-optimized operations. A key question is the feasibility of using existing data sets at hydropower facilities to perform assessments of asset reliability. This document uses data from hydropower facilities to assess the potential for using available analytics methods for asset reliability estimates. In addition to reliability assessments, the feasibility of using existing analytics techniques for several other potential applications is discussed. Finally, a case study that a data-driven model is trained to learn nominal operations via vibration data from an asset of a certain plant, and then utilized to identify anomalies on a similar asset from a different plant, highlighting the generic use of proposed Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nGiven the pervasive ubiquity of data, sales practice is moving rapidly into an era of predictive analytics, using quantitative methods, including machine learning algorithms, to reveal unknown information, such as customers’ personality, value, or churn probabilities. However, many sales organizations face difficulties when implementing predictive analytics applications. This article elucidates these difficulties by developing the PSAA model—a conceptual framework that explains how predictive sales analytics (PSA) applications support sales employees’ job performance. In particular, the PSAA model conceptualizes the key contingencies governing how the availability of PSA applications translates into adoption of these applications and, ultimately, job performance. These contingencies determine the extent to which sales employees adopt these applications to revise their decision-making and the extent to which these updates improve the decision outcome. To build the PSAA model, we integrate literature on predictive analytics and machine learning, technology adoption, and marketing capabilities. In doing so, this research provides a theoretical frame for future studies on salesperson adoption and effective utilization of PSA.",
