        "abstract": "The durability of concrete structures is essential for reliable infrastructure. Although many deterioration models are available, they are rarely applied in situ. For existing structures in need of repair or durability assessment, this is also the case for Building Information Modeling (BIM). However, both BIM and durability modeling hold great potential to both minimize expended resources and maximize the reliability of structures. At the Institute for Building Materials Research (ibac) at RWTH Aachen University, a novel approach to the calibration of deterioration models using Bayesian inference iteratively in a BIM model enriched with machine-readable diagnosis data to achieve a predictive decision support tool is being developed. This paper demonstrates the digital workflow, validates the proposed approach, and expresses the added value for the planning of repair measures.",

        "abstract": "\nBACKGROUND\nInformation technology can improve patient care plans to achieve high-quality care. However, few information systems can strengthen decision-making competency in health care environments. The most suitable and reliable inference engines for clinical decision support systems in nursing clinical practice have rarely been explored.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study examined the nursing diagnostic accuracy of a knowledge-based clinical decision support system (KBCDSS) based on clinical diagnostic validity (CDV) and the Bayesian decision models for nursing students to use during a psychiatric–mental health nursing practicum.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA single-blinded, nonequivalent control group pretest–posttest design was adopted. Participants were 607 nursing students. In the quasi-experimental design, 2 intervention groups using a KBCDSS with the CDV (n=203) or the Bayesian decision (n=198) inference engine and a control group (n=206) used the psychiatric care plan system without guidance indicators to support decision-making.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPositive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity indicated that decision-making competency was the highest for those in the CDV group followed by the Bayesian decision (BADE) and control groups. Relative to the control group, both the CDV and BADE groups exhibited significantly higher 3Q model questionnaire and modified TAM3 scores. In terms of perceived usefulness and behavioral intention, the CDV group had significantly higher 3Q model and modified TAM3 scores than did the BADE group, which had significantly higher scores than the control group did.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nKBCDSSs can be adopted to provide empirical patient-oriented information and help nursing students rapidly manage patient information and formulate patient-centered care plans.\n",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;I review the experience obtained in using integrative Bayesian models in interdisciplinary analysis focusing on oil spill risk analysis and water quality in the Baltic Sea. We have applied BBN especially to interdisciplinary analysis, which is easily needed in decision analysis. In the environmental risk analysis, we have mainly focused on the oil spills, where the data sets are poor and also the published papers are scarce. More importantly, the aim of the decision analysis here is to avoid seeing the data, i.e. to avoid accidents. Therefore, some of our applications are based mainly on the use of expert knowledge, especially when we consider decision options that have not been applied before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160; In the oil spill risk analysis, we have chosen the state of the threatened species as the decision criteria, as they have a status in other parts of Finnish legislation. There is no single clear objective in oil spill legislation which could be used as a utility function, and our analysis have shown, that the legislation should be updated to include well defined objectives. One of the scientific quality criteria for using the Bayesian decision analysis for management is that the uncertainty estimates are scientifically justified. Especially in cases where society is assumed to be highly risk averse, the uncertainty estimates related to alternative management options may have a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Biology, sociology and environmental economics have their own scientific traditions. Bayesian models are becoming traditional tools in fisheries biology, where uncertainty estimates of management options are frequently required. In sociology, the traditions allow the subjective treatment of the information, which supports the use of prior probability distributions. &amp;#160;Many of the environmental risks have also economic components, or at least actions have a price, which favors the use of quantitative risk analysis. However, the traditions and quality criteria of these three scientific fields are in many respects different. This creates both technical and human challenges to the modeling tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keywords: Bayesian networks, fisheries management, environmental management, interdisciplinary risk and decision analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

They implement probabilistic models based on Bayes’ Formula, previously proposed and published in the works of the authors. In these models, the estimated input data are interpreted as evidence in favor of one or another hypothesis from the set of possible ones, determined by the specifics of the model. All the evidence obtained is, in one way or another, transformed into a set of Bayesian conditional probabilities calculated under the assumption that the corresponding hypothesis is true, and the posterior probability distribution on the set of these hypotheses is used as the output. This distribution is used either directly as a result for decision making, or as a basis for calculating the final result. The features of the software implementation of models on the Java platform are discussed, the advantages of the models, confirmed or identified in the process of software implementation, are noted. The developed programs have a convenient graphical user interface and can be used as decision-making support tools to solve applied problems in the field of expert rating estimation and fuzzy inference.",

The use of decision support systems (DSSs) may assist to optimize fungicide programs to enhance application on the basis of risk associated with disease outbreak. Case-by-case evaluations demonstrated the performance of DSSs for disease control, but an overall assessment of the efficacy of DSSs is lacking. A literature review was conducted to synthesize the results of 67 experiments assessing DSSs. Disease incidence data were obtained from published peer-reviewed field trials comparing untreated controls, calendar-based and DSS-based fungicide programs. Two meta-analysis generic models, a “fixed-effects” vs. a “random-effects” model within the framework of generalized linear models were evaluated to assess the efficacy of DSSs in reducing incidence. All models were fit using both frequentist and Bayesian estimation procedures and the results compared. Model including random effects showed better performance in terms of AIC or DIC and goodness of fit. In general, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches produced similar results. Odds ratio and incidence ratio values showed that calendar-based and DSS-based fungicide programs considerably reduced disease incidence compared to the untreated control. Moreover, calendar-based and DSS-based programs provided similar reductions in disease incidence, further supporting the efficacy of DSSs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe impact of climate change is the implication of global warming that affects people around the world, including Indonesia, which is causing more the intensity and type of natural disaster that causes a decrease or malfunction of a city. To reduce the impact of climate change is needed for the application of the concept of resilience. Resilience is the ability to withstand disturbances caused by external factors and the ability to recover if damage occurs. One of the natural disasters is an earthquake is a natural disaster that often occurs in Indonesia and generally causes significant damage to the physical condition of buildings and infrastructure. This study aims to create a prediction model to measure the impact of a disaster as a decision support system such as a mitigation strategy and responses to identify measures that can improve performance infrastructure to meet resilience goals. One of probabilistic methods is the Bayesian Network method. It is a graphical model probabilistic that represents a set of variables and freedom probabilistic usingconditional-probability-table. This research expects as a proposed method of assessing resilience infrastructure to cities in Indonesia when natural disasters occur, especially earthquakes.",

The participants were 607 nursing students. In the quasi-experimental design, two intervention groups used either a Knowledge-Based Clinical Decision Support System with the Clinical Diagnostic Validity or a Knowledge-Based Clinical Decision Support System with the Bayesian Decision inference engine to complete their practicum tasks. Additionally, a control group used the psychiatric care planning system without guidance indicators to support their decision-making. SPSS, version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. chi-square (χ2) test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) used for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Analysis of covariance was done to examine the PPV and sensitivity in the three groups.\n\nResults\nResults for the positive predictive value and sensitivity variables indicated that decision-making competency was highest in the Clinical Diagnostic Validity group, followed by the Bayesian and control groups. The Clinical Diagnostic Validity and Bayesian Decision groups significantly outperformed the control group in terms of scores on a 3Q model questionnaire and the modified Technology Acceptance Model 3. In terms of perceived usefulness and behavioral intention, the Clinical Diagnostic Validity group had significantly higher 3Q model and modified Technology Acceptance Model 3 scores than the Bayesian Decision group, which had significantly higher scores than the control group.\n\nConclusion\nKnowledge-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems can be adopted to provide patient-oriented information and assist nursing student in the rapid management of patient information and formulation of patient-centered care plans.\n",

Traffic forecasting has always been a key issue in the smart transportation system. Aiming at the problem that a fixed model cannot adapt to multiple environments in traffic flow prediction and the problem of model updating for data flow, a traffic flow prediction method is proposed based on variable structure dynamic Bayesian network. Based on the complex event processing and event context, this method divides historical data through context clustering and supports cluster update through online clustering of event streams. For different clustered data, a search-scoring method is used to learn the corresponding Bayesian network structure, and a Bayesian network is approximated based on a Gaussian mixture model. When forecasting online, a suitable model or combination of models is selected according to the current context for prediction.",

Participants in the exercise work in groups to approach the case using four different computer-supported decision models to explore and recommend policies for emergency mitigation and city resilience. The case, as well as the decision models, can be a valuable GDSS tool, particularly in the mitigation stages of the emergency management cycle. We present preliminary results from the use of the case, models and a simulation environment in a graduate course.

        "abstract": "Satellite monitoring offers unique advantages to the industry in meeting the objectives of managing third-party encroachment to mitigate the potential of mechanical damage. Satellite monitoring of third-party encroachment involves a persistent acquisition of satellite imagery over a pipeline right-of-way (ROW), combined with computerized change detection to identify potentially hazardous activities. Monitoring using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides an all-weather day or night monitoring of a specific geographic location. This monitoring service can be enhanced with third-party information to increase the confidence in targets detected within satellite imagery. This information can also be used to reduce false positives. A simplistic example of this would be to use road location information overlaid with target information. A target found on a road, such as a tractor-trailer rolling down a highway, represents a small risk to a pipeline and subsequently can be given a lower risk or even be removed as a threat altogether. On the other hand, a large vehicle in a field near a pipeline and not on a road may represent a higher risk to a pipeline. The higher confidence data in-turn allows pipeline integrity operations staff to focus on the higher probability targets, saving time and resources, while maintaining safety standards. This concept has been implemented in the form of a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates with CalPoly's Representational State Transfer Access for Pipeline Integrity Database (RAPID).

Missing person cases consume resources from the already overstretched resources of Police Forces.

This chapter reviews current practices used for missing person cases and describes a decision support model based on Bayesian networks.",
