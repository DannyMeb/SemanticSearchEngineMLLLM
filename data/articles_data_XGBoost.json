The nonlinearity of stock market prices profoundly impacts global economic and financial sectors. This study focuses on modeling and forecasting the daily prices of key stock indices - MASI, CAC 40, DAX, FTSE 250, NASDAQ, and HKEX, representing the Moroccan, French, German, British, US, and Hong Kong markets, respectively. We compare the performance of machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the hybrid LSTM-XGBoost, and utilize the skforecast library for backtesting. Results show that the hybrid LSTM-XGBoost model, optimized using Grid Search (GS), outperforms other models, achieving high accuracy in forecasting daily prices. This contribution offers financial analysts and investors valuable insights, facilitating informed decision-making through precise forecasts of international stock prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty is a ubiquitous element in available knowledge about the real world. Data sampling error, obsolete sources, network latency, and transmission error are all factors that contribute to the uncertainty. These kinds of uncertainty have to be handled cautiously, or else the classification results could be unreliable or even erroneous. There are numerous methodologies developed to comprehend and control uncertainty in data. There are many faces for uncertainty i.e., inconsistency, imprecision, ambiguity, incompleteness, vagueness, unpredictability, noise, and unreliability. Missing information is inevitable in real-world data sets. While some conventional multiple imputation approaches are well studied and have shown empirical validity, they entail limitations in processing large datasets with complex data structures. In addition, these standard approaches tend to be computationally inefficient for medium and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a scalable multiple imputation frameworks based on XGBoost, bootstrapping and regularized method. XGBoost, one of the fastest implementations of gradient boosted trees, is able to automatically retain interactions and non-linear relations in a dataset while achieving high computational efficiency with the aid of bootstrapping and regularized methods. In the context of high-dimensional data, this methodology provides fewer biased estimates and reflects acceptable imputation variability than previous regression approaches. We validate our adaptive imputation approaches with standard methods on numerical and real data sets and shown promising results.",

Using the case database of Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1231 cases suffering from AP were screened, and after 137 variables were identified, the clinical characteristics of the samples were statistically analyzed, and the data were randomly divided into a training set (75%) to build the XGBoost model and a test set (25%) for validation. Finally, the performance of the model was evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and subject characteristics working characteristic curves. The model performance is also compared with that of three other commonly used machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and random forest). The age and laboratory tests of patients with AP combined with ALI differed from those of patients without combined acute lung injury. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the test set after model evaluation was 0.9534, the specificity was 0.7333, and the sensitivity was 0.7857, with arterial partial pressure of oxygen, bile acid, aspartate transaminase, urea nitrogen, and arterial blood pH as its most important influencing factors. In this study, the XGBoost model has advantages compared with other three machine learning algorithms.

Data preprocessing techniques, including Min-Max scaling and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), are applied to prepare the dataset. The XGBoost model is then developed and fine-tuned to achieve an accuracy of approximately 93.33% in detecting Parkinson’s disease. The model exhibits high precision, recall, and F1-Score, making it a valuable tool for early disease detection in the healthcare domain.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate prediction of short-time cab speed is a prerequisite for identifying abnormal acceleration and deceleration behaviors of drivers, which helps to improve passenger safety and comfort. The XGBoost-based short-time cab speed prediction model is studied based on the real-time movement speed of cabs in cities. The cab speed data set is divided into a training set and a test set, a sliding time window is constructed, the time series of historical cab speed within the time window is used as the input variable, and the current time cab speed is used as the output variable. The model parameters are quickly optimized by using the hyperopt module based on Bayesian algorithm to obtain the optimal combination of model parameters, and the prediction results of the model are compared with the non-parametric regression model and neural network model based on the cab GPS trajectory data set of Shenzhen city on October 22, 2013. It is shown that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the constructed short-time cab speed prediction model is $9.841$ and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 12.711, which are lower than those of the nonparametric regression model and the neural network model, improving the prediction accuracy of cab speed; due to the lack of regularity of cab speed series, the adjusted $R^{2}$ is $0.592$, and compared with the other two models, the XGBoost model has a better fitting effect near the time point when the cab speed changes sharply, avoiding the degradation of prediction accuracy caused by overfitting.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccurate traffic speed prediction plays a crucial role in traffic management and transportation planning. In this paper, we propose a long-time traffic speed prediction model based on XGBoost, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm. Our method addresses the challenge of predicting traffic speed over extended time horizons by incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies, feature selection, and interpretability analysis. We conduct experiments on a real-world traffic dataset and compare our results with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The incorporation of spatial and temporal dependencies, coupled with the interpretability analysis provided by XGBoost, enables us to capture complex traffic patterns and gain insights into the factors influencing traffic speed. Our research contributes to the field of traffic prediction by offering a robust and interpretable solution that can aid in traffic management, urban planning, and intelligent transportation systems.",

        "abstract": "Java dilini kullanan kötü amaçlı yazılımlarla gerçekleştirilen saldırılar, geçtiğimiz yıllarda hızla artış göstermeye başlamıştır. Bu artışlarla birlikte kötü amaçlı yazılımların kişilere ve kurumlara verebileceği zararlar araştırmacıları otomatik algılama sistemlerini geliştirerek güçlendirmek için farklı makine öğrenme teknikleri geliştirmeye ve test etmeye yöneltmiştir. Bu çalışmada kötü amaçlı Jar dosyalarının tespiti için ikili parçacık sürü optimizasyonu tabanlı öznitelik seçimi ve XGBoost algoritması ile sınıflandırma yapan hibrit bir sistem önerilmiştir. İkili parçacık sürü optimizasyonu algoritmasında minimizasyon sağlanırken kullanılan uygunluk fonksiyonunda rastgele orman algoritması kullanılmıştır. Öznitelik seçimi ile sınıflandırma algoritmasının üzerine düşen hesaplama yükü azaltılarak hız ve performans artırımı hedeflenmiştir. Önerilen modelde 10 kat çapraz doğrulama yapılarak eğitim ve testler gerçekleştirilmiştir. XGBoost algoritması ile yapılan tespit mekanizmasında doğruluk, kesinlik, F1-Skoru, duyarlılık metrikleri ile kurulan modelin performansı ortaya konulmuştur. Önerilen modelin performansının değerlendirilmesi amacıyla AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Destek Vektör Makineleri, Yapay Sinir Ağları, Naive Bayes yöntemleri ile testler yapılmış ve sonuçlar karşılaştırılmıştır. Deneysel sonuçlar, önerilen ikili parçacık sürü optimizasyonu tabanlı öznitelik seçimi ve XGBoost algoritması ile sınıflandırma yapan hibrit modelin kötü amaçlı Jar yazılım tespitinde %98.04 doğruluk oranı ile karşılaştırılan modellere göre daha başarılı olduğunu göstermiştir.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDetermining the credit worthiness of an individual for a loan approval is a challenging task for most financial institutions. To assess the credibility of an individual, a credit score model is often used and it encompasses factors such payment consistency of customers and their behaviors and their previous behaviors. Due to its easy interpretation and outstanding prediction performance for both static and time-varying, evolving domains, machine learning has gained a lot of reputation over statistical approaches. For this reason, machine learning has gained much attention in the automation of the design of effective and efficient credit scoring techniques over the years. Credit scoring task is also an ephemeral scenario as most of the variables are likely to drift overtime, making the use of stream mining suitable for detecting and adapting to changes in the underlying data distribution. Given a problem in such time-varying and evolving environment, credit scoring models that were once robust may become suboptimal if the behavior of customers change over time as their earnings get eroded by changes in interest rates, natural disasters and increases in pay as you earn, rendering the current credit score model outdated. In credit scoring, many of the variables tend to drift over time resulting in an ephemeral scenario that requires online machine learning algorithms tailored for learning in time-varying and evolving environments where the target concept changes. Since machine learning algorithms can learn incrementally, they are able to detect learn changes that occur in the data. In this paper, we propose an online Decision Trees based eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) credit scoring model that is based on a heterogeneous adaptive particle swarm optimization where behaviors change at each iteration by randomly selecting new behaviors from the behavior pool. The prediction performance of our approach is evaluated first as a batch learning algorithm and secondly as a data steam learning algorithm using a variety of validation schemes for traditional batch learning and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability index metrics. Each behavior consists of a pair containing a position update and a velocity update. Decision Trees can easily sift through credit data characterized by a high dimensional curse and a complex correlation. The behavior of our proposed approach is evaluated for both static and dynamic domains since customer variables tend to drift over time. Empirical experiments conducted showed that our proposed approach performs comparatively well in both static and dynamic environments on four datasets.",

        "abstract": "Günümüz akıllı evlerinde IoT (Internet of Things) teknolojisinin alt yapısı kullanılmaktadır. Akıllı evlerin kullanımı arttıkça bu alandaki siber saldırılar da artmaktadır. Akıllı evlere yönelik siber saldırıları mümkün olduğunca erken tespit etmek ve önlemek çok önemlidir. Bu çalışmada, akıllı evlere yönelik siber saldırıları tespit etmek ve önlemek için makine öğrenmesi tabanlı bir yöntem önerilmiştir. Öncelikle “Home Assistant” teknolojisini kullanarak akıllı ev platformu oluşturulmuştur. Akıllı evler, “Home Assistant” teknolojisini kapsamlı bir şekilde kullanır. Oluşturulan akıllı ev platformu, sensörler ve kameralardan yararlanıyor. İnsanlar, sensörler ve kameralar kullanarak evlerini uzaktan izleyebilmekte ve yönetebilmektedir. Geliştirilen akıllı ev platformu üzerinde “brute force ftp”, “brute force ssh”, “dos http flood”, “dos icmp flood”, “dos syn flood”, “syn scan” ve “udp scan” olmak üzere yedi saldırı gerçekleştirilmiştir. Toplanan veri seti, “normal” paketlerle birlikte sekiz sınıftan oluşmaktadır. Sekiz sınıf için toplam 435815 örnek veri toplanmıştır. Elde edilen bu veri seti üzerinde XGBOOST algoritması kullanılmış ve saldırı türleri sınıflandırılmıştır. Hold-out 80:20 ve Hold-out 70:30 eğitim testi verileri için sırasıyla %92.55 ve %92.49 doğruluk hesaplanmıştır. Önerilen XGBOOST algoritmasının sonuçları, diğer makine öğrenimi algoritmalarının sonuçlarıyla karşılaştırılmış ve sonuçların başarılı olduğu görülmüştür.",
