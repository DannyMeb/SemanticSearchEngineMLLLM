        "abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to the growth and expansion of various new opportunities in the new Industrial Transformation. There have been notable challenges regarding the security of data and challenges related to privacy when collecting real-time and automatic data while observing applications in the industry. This paper proposes an Federated Transfer Learning for Authentication and Privacy Preservation Using Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG (S-TD3) Algorithm for IIoT. In FT-Block (Federated transfer learning blockchain), several blockchains are applied to preserve privacy and security for all types of industrial applications. Additionally, by introducing the authentication mechanism based on transfer learning, blockchains can enhance the preservation and security standards for industrial applications. Specifically, Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG trains the user model to authenticate specific regions. As it is considered one of the most open and scalable interacting platforms of information, it successfully helps in the positive transfer of different kinds of data between devices in more significant and local operations of the industry. It is mainly due to a single authentication factor, and the poor adaptation to regular increases in the number of users and different requirements that make the current authentication mechanism suffer a lot in IIoT. As a result, it has been very clearly observed that the given solutions are very useful.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) trajectory planning to avoid radar detection threats is a complicated optimization problem that has been widely studied. The rapid changes in Radar Cross Sections (RCSs), the unknown cruise trajectory of airborne radar, and the uncertain distribution of radars exacerbate the complexity of this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel UCAV trajectory planning method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology to overcome the adverse impacts caused by the dynamics and randomness of environments. A predictive control model is constructed to describe the dynamic characteristics of the UCAV trajectory planning problem in detail. To improve the UCAVâs predictive ability, we propose a memory-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (ME-TD3) algorithm that uses an attention mechanism to effectively extract environmental patterns from historical information. The simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully train UCAVs to carry out trajectory planning tasks in dynamic and unknown environments. Furthermore, the ME-TD3 algorithm outperforms other classical DRL algorithms in UCAV trajectory planning, exhibiting superior performance and adaptability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn both discrete and continuous domains, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied to the vast majority of reinforcement learning problems and are the main solution to real world problems. In reinforcement learning problems with continuous action space, state-of-the-art algorithms are extremely sample-inefficient and need lots of training interactions to become proficient, which could be catastrophically expensive and infeasible in real-world problems. So far, frontier algorithms have not used well-defined methods to explore the decision space. Exploring new behaviors is a prerequisite to look for optimal policies. All of the leading algorithms in the field leverage a blind form of exploration added to agent decisions to search for better policies. Such solutions fail to mindfully explore the environment, disrupting the learning process. This makes these algorithms very prone to failing in specific domains. In this research, a novel stochastic Off-Policy Actor-Critic algorithm, TDS for short, is presented. Combining the policy gradient theorem with the deterministic policy gradient, the TDS algorithm can learn how to mindfully explore the environment. The proposed update method enables TDS to learn how to modify the decision stochasticity bonds for each state and action. This is done according to gradients information derived from learning feedbacks. Evaluations in MuJoCo and Box2D tasks show faster convergence or outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms including TD3, SAC, and DDPG in every environment tested.",

Multiple pregnancies have a higher incidence of complications, preterm birth, and abortion compared with single pregnancies, and while the second fetus in twin pregnancies is typically delivered soon after the first, continued pregnancy can sometimes result in improved outcomes for the newborn. However, there are no guidelines for the management of delayed delivery in twin pregnancies. This case report describes a successful delayed delivery in our hospital.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots are very popular topics in the robotic field owing to walking on hard terrain. In the current study, the walking of a bipedal robot that is legged robot was aimed. For this purpose, the system was examined and an artificial neural network was designed. After, the neural network was trained by using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms. After the training process, the PPO algorithm was formed better training performance than the DDPG algorithm. Also, the optimal noise standard deviation of the PPO algorithm was investigated. The results were shown that the best results were obtained by using 0.50. The system was tested by utilizing the artificial neural networks that trained the PPO algorithm which has got 0.50 noise standard deviation. According to the test result, the total reward was calculated as 274.334 and the walking task was achieved by purposed structure. As a result, the current study has formed the basis for controlling a bipedal robot and the PPO noise standard deviation selection.",

        "abstract": "Twin pregnancies are high-risk pregnancies accompanied with multiple complications, such as: spontaneous abortion, preterm rupture of the membranes, preterm delivery, intrauterine death of one or both twins etc. There is no consensus about the management of twinÂ  pregnancies complicated with preterm rupture of the membranes of one twin and risk of preterm delivery. These cases are rarely found in the literature. We present a case of a 35 years old patient, hospitalized in a tertiary level institution, because of a diamniotic dichorionic twin pregnancy complicated with preterm rupture of the membranes of the first twin at 19 weeks of gestation. She had one delivery with Caesarean section 16 years ago. In consultation with the patient induction of labor was done with delivery of the first twin, a death male fetus. After that, antibiotics and tocolytic therapy were administrated and the patient remained in the hospital about one week. The patient was discharged at home with regular control of her condition and condition of the fetus. The patient was again hospitalized at 33 weeks of gestation with uterine contractions on cardiotocography. After administration of corticosteroid therapy for fetal lung maturation she delivered spontaneously the second twin in a good condition andÂ  she was discharged from hospital after 16 days. In twin pregnancies clinicians must think about delayed interval delivery of the second twin, after delivery of the first twin, with an aim to increase chances for survival, especially for pregnancies less than 30 weeks of gestation.",

Inspired by this learning method, machine learning researchers have reduced this learning method to subheadings as value learning and policy learning. In this study, the noise standard deviation of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method, which is one of the policy learning algorithms, was examined to solve inverse kinematics of a 2 degrees-of-freedom planar robot. For this examination, 8 different functions were determined depending on the maximum value of the output of the action artificial neural network. Created artificial neural networks were trained by using these functions in 1000 iterations with 200 steps in each iteration. After the training, the statistical difference between the groups was examined and it was found that there was no statistical difference between the three best groups. For this reason, the best three groups were retrained 2500 iterations and 200 steps and tested for 100 different test scenarios after the training. After testing, the inverse kinematic equation of the 2 degrees-of-freedom planar robot with minimal errors was obtained with the help of artificial neural networks. In the light of the results, the importance of the choice of the standard deviation of noise and the correct range of selection was presented for researchers who will work in this field.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionIn a large biobank of over half a million people, we have several pairs of participants who appear to share their genome. As more individuals are sequenced, more pairs are likely to be found. If these are twins then this is great news, but it isnât quite that simple.\r\nObjectives and ApproachWhere 2 people share a genome we need to be able to confirm that these pairs are twins. However, there are a number of issues which could cause 2 people to appear to share a genome; for example being recruited twice, donating blood on anotherâs behalf, etc. We already identify and exclude participant data based on these conditions. We developed our methodology by looking at the first identified pair in great detail, looking for evidence which specifically ruled out possible alternate explanations, and then applying and refining the method on later pairs.\r\nResultsWe were able to demonstrate the pair were almost certainly twins using their biochemistry and family questionnaire data as principal sources. We also identified a number of variables which were useful in indicating the likelihood of a twin, and now form part of a methodology which we are still developing. Even more usefully, we identified a number of variables that seemed like useful measures but proved extremely misleading. To date we have 26 pairs of possible twins, with 9 confirmed as twins and the remainder looking likely to be twins but falling short of a threshold for confidence. We also have 75 pairs which confirm duplicate participants we have already excluded.\r\nConclusion/ImplicationsWe formed two lessons: even very simply linkages come with pitfalls, and you should gather more administrative data than you think. Weâre proposing the collection of additional familial relationship data in our third resurvey. We are also looking into machine learning and statistical techniques to better identify twins and duplicates.",

The aim of this study was to examine feasibility and outcomes associated with DCC in twins.\n\n\nMETHODS:\nThis is a retrospective cohort study of women delivering dichorionic-diamniotic twin gestations between 23-32 weeks gestation at a single center (2013-2015). In 6/2013, this institution introduced a DCC protocol for singleton neonates delivering < 32 weeks, with some dichorionic twins who also received DCC. Clinical characteristics and neonatal outcomes of twins receiving DCC were compared to those who did not. Bivariable assessments and fixed effects multivariable logistic and linear regression were utilized.\n\n\nRESULTS:\nOf 58 women delivering dichorionic twins < 32 weeks, 8 (13.8%) had both neonates receive DCC, resulting in 16 neonates who received DCC. DCC occurred both among those who were delivered vaginally (n=7), and by cesarean section (n=9). Neonates who received DCC, compared to those who did not, had similar umbilical artery pH, initial temperature, 5-minute Apgar score, and peak bilirubin. Additionally, there were no differences in neonatal intensive care unit length of stay, birth hematocrit, total number of blood transfusions or transfusions received in the first week, mechanical ventilation, need for pressors, death, or other adverse outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPerformance of DCC in dichorionic twin gestations born < 32 weeks is feasible and not associated with worse neonatal outcomes in this small cohort. Further investigation of expansion of DCC protocols to dichorionic twin gestations appears worthy of exploration.\n",

This question proposes to use the TD3 algorithm to implement a deep reinforcement learning model, introduce commonly used stock technical indicators, design reward and action functions, and use them to backtest recent stock trading data. Finally, comparing it with the moving average strategy and other deep reinforcement learning models, it was found that in the past decade of historical data, the annualized rate of the moving average strategy was 10% -15%, while the annualized rate of the TD3 algorithm was 23% -25%.

        "abstract": "Starting from the fact that in sensorless control systems of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) the load torque can have short and significant variations, this paper presents the sensorless control of a PMSM based on a Linear Adaptive Disturbance Rejection Controller (LADRC) type controller. Essentially, the successful operation of the LADRC controller to achieve PMSM rotor speed control performance depends on a good estimation of the disturbances acting on the system. Traditionally, an Extended State Observer (ESO) is used to make such an estimate. In this paper, it is proposed to use a Disturbance Observer (DO) to estimate the external disturbances, and after their rejection, the LADRC controller ensures an equivalent global behavior of the control system with an ideal double integrator, and thus increased ease in achieving the desired control performance. Control structures and Matlab/Simulink implementation of the sensorless PMSM control system based on LADRC controller with ESO/DO type observer are presented, as well as its use in tandem with a Reinforcement Learning Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RL-TD3) specially trained agent that provides correction signals for more accurate estimation of external disturbances and hence improved control performance. Qualitatively superior performance is achieved by using LADRC with the RL-TD3 agent control structure in terms of parametric robustness, response time, and steady-state error. Also, by calculating the fractal dimension (DF) of the controlled signal and the PMSM rotor speed, it is found that the higher the DF, the better the performance of the control system. The validation of the superiority of the proposed control structures is carried out by means of numerical simulations in the Matlab/Simulink environment.",

        "abstract": " Twin delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient has several limitations when applied in planning a path in environment with a number of dilemmas according to our experiment, due to the complexity of the robot path planning task, the rate of convergence of TD3 algorithm is slow and the rate of collision is high. To address this problem, deep dense dueling twin delayed deep deterministic (D3-TD3) architecture is proposed, a method that preserves important information from cross-layer inputs through dense connections and divides the network into a value function and a dominance function, thus, allowing for faster convergence when solving complex tasks. Finally, a spatial model based on three-dimension (3D) point cloud is built, and simulation experimental results show that in static environment, the algorithm proposed in the paper has 40.6% fewer collisions compared to TD3, 30% fewer collisions compared to TD3-BC, 19.2% fewer collisions compared to Dueling TD3 and 17.4% fewer collisions compared to deep dense TD3. In dynamic and static environment, the algorithm proposed in the paper has 34.4% fewer collisions compared to TD3, 24% fewer collisions compared to TD3-BC, 6% fewer collisions compared to Dueling TD3 and 25% fewer collisions compared to deep dense TD3.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel type of transdermal drug delivery device (TD3) with a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) design using computer-aided design (CAD) techniques as well as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations regarding the fluid interaction inside the device during the actuation process. For the actuation principles of the chamber and microvalve, both thermopneumatic and piezoelectric principles are employed respectively, originating that the design perfectly integrates those principles through two different components, such as a micropump with integrated microvalves and a microneedle array. The TD3 has shown to be capable of delivering a volumetric flow of 2.92 Ã 10â5 cm3/s with a 6.6 Hz membrane stroke frequency. The device only needs 116 Pa to complete the suction process and 2560 Pa to complete the discharge process. A 38-microneedle array with 450 Âµm in length fulfills the function of permeating skin, allowing that the fluid reaches the desired destination and avoiding any possible pain during the insertion.",

        "abstract": "Due to the large scale of power systems, latency uncertainty in communications can cause severe problems in wide-area measurement systems. To resolve this issue, a significant amount of past work focuses on using emerging technology, including machine learning methods such as Q-learning, for addressing latency issues in modern controls. Although the method can deal with the stochastic characteristics of communication latency, the Q-values can be overestimated in Q-learning methods, leading to high bias. To address the overestimation bias issue, we redesign the learning structure of the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Then we develop a damping control twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method to handle the damping control issue under unknown latency in the power network. The purpose is to address the damping control issue under unknown latency in the power network. This paper will create a novel reward algorithm, taking into account the machine speed deviation, the episode termination prevention, and the feedback from action space. In this way, the system optimally damps down frequency oscillations while maintaining the systemâs stability and reliable operation within defined limits. The simulation results verify the proposed algorithm in various perspectives, including the latency sensitivity analysis under high renewable energy penetration and the comparison with conventional and machine learning control algorithms. The proposed method shows a fast learning curve and good control performance under varying communication latency.",

However, their performances have not yet been compared in detail. We show the implementation of the three AI algorithms on a simulated fiber laser mode-locked by nonlinear polarization rotation. The reward function is specifically designed to maximize the tendency of mode-locking by introducing kurtosis in frequency domain. The training curves indicate that TD3 and SAC outperform DDQN in multi-input context. DDQN has difficulty in handling multiple inputs and tends to have issues with convergence. While TD3 is most stable and efficient, SAC is more advantageous in searching various states. The simulation pulse evolution diagrams of these states are also listed to confirm the feasibility of training a mode-locked laser model through the three AI algorithms.",

On the basis of not changing the UAV's native controller, the decision-making model is designed to help the UAV realize local path planning work in unfamiliar environments based on environmental information. The model filters and extracts the UAV sensor, camera image information, and lidar information, inputs them into the reinforcement learning agent, outputs high-level command actions to the robot cooperative operating system, and transmits the movement commands from the operating system to the UAV, realizes the local path planning task of the UAV, and carries out the test experiments based on the training results. The test results show that the autonomous local path planning algorithm for UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning can effectively realize the autonomous local path planning task of UAVs, and the success rate reaches 93% under the interference of no obstacles, and 92% in the environment with obstacles. The success rate and portability of UAV implementation of path planning are improved.",

To reduce the tracking error of the permanent magnet synchronous motor, a reinforcement learning (RL) control algorithm based on double delay deterministic gradient algorithm (TD3) is proposed. The physical modeling of PMSM is carried out in Simulink, and the current controller controlling id-axis and iq-axis in the current loop is replaced by a reinforcement learning controller. The optimal control network parameters were obtained through simulation learning, and DDPG, BP, and LQG algorithms were simulated and compared under the same conditions. In the experiment part, the trained RL network was compiled into C code according to the workflow with the help of rapid prototyping control, and then downloaded to the controller for testing. The measured output signal is consistent with the simulation results, which shows that the algorithm can significantly reduce the tracking error under the variable speed of the motor, making the system have a fast response.",

The current case describes a 34-year woman with previous 2 failed IVF conceptions, on external progesterone support, carrying a twin gestation in preterm labour. Upon the inadvertent delivery of the first twin, a cervical cerclage was done, and she was given conservative management, including bed rest and head low position in view of short cervix, with an aim to delay the delivery of the other. An interval of 66 days was achieved with surgical as well as medical management, following which a healthy second twin was born.",

This was a retrospective cohort study of 705 twin pregnancies who delivered at â¥â24 weeks of gestation. Maternal and neonatal hemoglobin levels, blood transfusion, and neonatal outcomes were compared between DCC (nâ=â225) and ICC (nâ=â480) groups. Mean maternal predelivery and postpartum hemoglobin levels and the rate of postpartum hemoglobin dropââ¥â20% or maternal blood transfusion were comparable between the two groups. The DCC group had a significantly higher mean neonatal hemoglobin level (DCC vs. ICC: 17.4âÂ±â3.5 vs. 16.6âÂ±â2.7 g/dl, Pâ=â0.010) but significantly lower rates of neonatal blood transfusion (DCC vs. ICC: 3.3% vs. 8.8%, Pâ<â0.001) and respiratory distress syndrome (DCC vs. ICC: 6.7% vs. 15.2%, Pâ<â0.001) than the ICC group. In conclusion, DCC compared with ICC in twin pregnancy was not associated with an increase of maternal postpartum bleeding complications, but it was associated with higher neonatal hemoglobin level and lower risks of neonatal blood transfusion and respiratory distress syndrome.",

First, the attitude dynamics model of the studied quadrotor is derived and the attitude control problem is described by formulas. Second, a sliding mode controller including its sliding mode surface and reaching law is selected for the nonlinear dynamic system, and the stability of the designed SMC system is supported by Lyapunov stability theorem. Third, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is trained to adjust the switching control gain adaptively. During the training process, the input signals of agent are the actual and desired attitude angles, and the output action is the time-varying control gain. Finally, the above trained agent is applied to the SMC as a parameter regulator, to implement the adaptive adjustment of the switching control gain related to reaching law, and the simulation results verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed DDPG-SMC method.",
