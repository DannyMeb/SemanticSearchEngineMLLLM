        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\nRiau batik is known since the 18th century and is used by royal kings. Riau Batik is made by using a stamp that is mixed with coloring and then printed on fabric. The fabric used is usually silk. As its development, comparing Javanese  batik with riau batik Riau is very slowly accepted by the public. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a combination of artificial neural networks and deeplearning methods. CNN consists of one or more convolutional layers, often with a subsampling layer followed by one or more fully connected layers as a standard neural network. In the process, CNN will conduct training and testing of Riau batik so that a collection of batik models that have been classified based on the characteristics that exist in Riau batik can be determined so that images are Riau batik and non-Riau batik. Classification using CNN produces Riau batik and not Riau batik with an accuracy of 65%. Accuracy of 65% is due to basically many of the same motifs between batik and other batik with the difference lies in the color of the absorption in the batik riau.\r\nKata kunci: Batik; Batik Riau; CNN; Image; Deep Learning\r\n \r\nABSTRAK\r\n \r\nBatik Riau dikenal sejak abad ke 18 dan digunakan oleh bangsawan raja. Batik Riau dibuat dengan menggunakan cap yang dicampur dengan pewarna kemudian dicetak di kain. Kain yang digunakan biasanya sutra. Seiring perkembangannya, dibandingkan batik Jawa maka batik Riau sangat lambat diterima oleh masyarakat. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) merupakan kombinasi dari jaringan syaraf tiruan dan metode deeplearning. CNN terdiri dari satu atau lebih lapisan konvolutional, seringnya dengan suatu lapisan subsampling yang diikuti oleh satu atau lebih lapisan yang terhubung penuh sebagai standar jaringan syaraf. Dalam prosesnya CNN akan melakukan training dan testing terhadap batik Riau sehingga didapat kumpulan model batik yang telah terklasi    fikasi berdasarkan ciri khas yang ada pada batik Riau sehingga dapat ditentukan gambar (image) yang merupakan batik Riau dan yang bukan merupakan batik Riau. Klasifikasi menggunakan CNN menghasilkan batik riau dan bukan batik riau dengan akurasi 65%. Akurasi 65% disebabkan pada dasarnya banyak motif yang sama antara batik riau dengan batik lainnya dengan perbedaan terletak pada warna cerap pada batik riau.\r\nKata kunci: Batik; Batik Riau; CNN; Image; Deep Learning",

        "abstract": "Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), flares, compressive/shock waves, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun&#8217;s outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) are produced through particle acceleration in flares or CME-driven shocks. Exact mechanisms behind SEP production are yet to be understood, but it is thought that most of their acceleration occurs in shocks starting in the low corona. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observations have become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has required the development of software approaches for automated characterization of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while the complexities in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced a hybrid algorithmic&#8212;data driven approach for characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features with the improved wavelet-based, multi-instrument Wavetrack package (Stepanyuk et.al, J. Space Weather Space Clim. (2024)), which was used to produce training datasets for data driven image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Its perfomance was shown on a limited set of SDO AIA 193A instrument data perfoming segmentation of EUV and shock waves. Here we extend this approach and present an ensemble of more general CNN models for data-driven segmentation of various eruptive phenomena for the set of ground-based and remote instruments data. We discuss our approach to engineering training sets and data augmentation, CNN topology and training techniques.&#160;",

This research identifies 2200 pieces of literature in the field. After considering the PRISMA guideline the most relevant and fundamental application had been reduced to 46 documents where the single and hybrid methods had been identified. The investigation showed that hybrid methods delivered a better performance with higher accuracy. It is expected that more hybrid methods will have emerged in the smart grid application.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe evolution of the Internet has given rise to novel forms of network attacks, underscoring the importance of investigating methods for detecting anomalous behaviour and accurately classifying attacks within the domain of cyberspace. Recently, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been employing various deep learning-based methodologies to construct a model that is driven by data. The aforementioned techniques are advantageous as they reduce the cost and labour involved in manual detection. The precision and capability of feature extraction in contemporary intrusion detection techniques exhibit significant variability. Furthermore, the presence of extraneous and repetitive phrases is ubiquitous in real-time network data. To tackle the aforementioned concerns, the present study proposes the utilisation of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithm for the purpose of detecting intrusions. Initially, in order to enhance resource utilisation and reduce time complexity, a configuration of 16 layers and 8 convolutional neural networks with Max-Pooling1D is utilised. Subsequently, a series of evaluative experiments conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset indicate that the enhanced CNN model has the potential to enhance the performance of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The precision for all types of features is reported to be 0.991, while the recall and f1-measure are noted to be 0.995 and 0.993, respectively",

        "abstract": "While humans have traditionally excelled at discerning emotions through facial expressions, achieving the same capability with a computer program has proven challenging. However, recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning have made it feasible to recognize emotions accurately. This paper introduces a novel facial emotion identification technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Emotion Recognition (FERC). FERC utilizes a twopart convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture: The paper consists of two main sections. The first section is dedicated to removing the background from the image, while the second section focuses on extracting the facial feature vector. The FERC model utilizes an expressional vector (EV) to identify five different regular facial expressions. With its single-level CNN approach, FERC offers improved accuracy compared to commonly used techniques. Moreover, prior to constructing the EV, a novel background removal strategy is implemented to address various potential challenges, such as distance from the camera. The application of FERC in emotion detection holds promise for a wide range of applications, including student predictive learning and lie detection.",

        "abstract": "AbstractLigand peptides that have high affinity for ion channels are critical for regulating ion flux across the plasma membrane. These peptides are now being considered as potential drug candidates for many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancers. There are several studies to identify ion channel interacting peptides computationally, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them published available tools for prediction. To provide a solution, we present Multi-branch-CNN, a parallel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) method for identifying three types of ion channel peptide binders (sodium, potassium, and calcium). Our experiment shows that the Multi-Branch-CNN method performs comparably to thirteen traditional ML algorithms (TML13) on the test sets of three ion channels. To evaluate the predictive power of our method with respect to novel sequences, as is the case in real-world applications, we created an additional test set for each ion channel, called the novel-test set, which has little or no similarities to the sequences in either the sequences of the train set or the test set. In the novel-test experiment, Multi-Branch-CNN performs significantly better than TML13, showing an improvement in accuracy of 6%, 14%, and 15% for sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, respectively. We confirmed the effectiveness of Multi-Branch-CNN by comparing it to the standard CNN method with one input branch (Single-Branch-CNN) and an ensemble method (TML13-Stack). To facilitate applications, the data sets, script files to reproduce the experiments, and the final predictive models are freely available athttps://github.com/jieluyan/Multi-Branch-CNN.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Covid-19 virus outbreak that emerged in China at the end of 2019 caused a huge and devastating effect worldwide. In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, the amount of 25 lung CT images in total (15 of Covid-19 patients and 10 of normal) was multiplied (250 images in total) using three data augmentation methods which relate to contrast change, brightness change and noise addition, and these images were subjected to automatic classification. Within the scope of the study, experiments were made for each case which include the use of the CT images of lungs (gray-level and RGB) directly, the images obtained by applying Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to these images (gray-level and RGB) and the images obtained by combining these images (gray-level and RGB). In the study, a 23-layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture was developed and used in classification processes. Leave-one-group-out cross validation method was used to test the proposed system. In this context, the result of the study indicated that the best AUC and EER values were obtained for the combination of original (RGB) and LBP applied (RGB) images, and these figures are 0,9811 and 0,0445 respectively. It was observed that, applying LBP to images, the use of CNN input causes an increase in sensitivity values while it causes a decrease in values of specificity. The highest sensitivity was obtained for the case of using LBP-applied (RGB) images and has a value of 0,9947. Within the scope of the study, the highest values of specificity and accuracy were obtained by the help of CT of lungs (gray-level) with 0,9120 and 95,32%, respectively. The results of the study indicate that analyzing images of lung CT using deep learning methods in diagnosing Covid-19 disease will speed up the diagnosis and significantly reduce the burden on healthcare workers.",

This problem presents additional challenges as compared to car (or any object) detection from ground images because features of vehicles from aerial images are more difficult to discern. To investigate this issue, we assess the performance of two state-of-the-art CNN algorithms, namely Faster R-CNN, which is the most popular region-based algorithm, and YOLOv3, which is known to be the fastest detection algorithm. We analyze two datasets with different characteristics to check the impact of various factors, such as UAV&rsquo;s altitude, camera resolution, and object size. The objective of this work is to conduct a robust comparison between these two cutting-edge algorithms. By using a variety of metrics, we show that none of the two algorithms outperforms the other in all cases.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground:\nDementia is a progressive disease that worsens over time as cognitive abilities deteriorate. Effective preventive interventions require early detection. However, there are no reports in the literature concerning apps that have been developed and designed to predict patient dementia classes (DCs). This study aimed to develop an app that could predict DC automatically and accurately for patients responding to the clinical dementia rating (CDR) instrument.\n\n\nMethods:\nA CDR was applied to 366 outpatients in a hospital in Taiwan, with assessments on 25 and 49 items endorsed by patients and family members, respectively. The 2 models of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to examine the prediction accuracy based on 5 classes (i.e., no cognitive decline, very mild, mild, moderate, and severe) in 4 scenarios, consisting of 74 (items) in total, 25 in patients, 49 in family, and a combination strategy to select the best in the aforementioned scenarios using the forest plot. Using CDR scores in patients and their families on both axes, patients were dispersed on a radar plot. An app was developed to predict patient DC.\n\n\nResults:\nWe found that ANN had higher accuracy rates than CNN with a ratio of 3:1 in the 4 scenarios. The highest accuracy rate (=93.72%) was shown in the combination scenario of ANN. A significant difference was observed between the CNN and ANN in terms of the accuracy rate. An available ANN-based app for predicting DC in patients was successfully developed and demonstrated in this study.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOn the basis of a combination strategy and a decision rule, a 74-item ANN model with 285 estimated parameters was developed and included. The development of an app that will assist clinicians in predicting DC in clinical settings is required in the near future.\n",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer can progress silently in its early stages and frequently without noticeable symptoms. However, it poses a serious risk to women. It is imperative to recognize this potential health concern to mitigate it early. In the last few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced significantly in their ability to classify images of breast cancer. Their capacity to automatically extract discriminant features from images has enhanced the performances and accuracy of image classification tasks. They outperform state-of-the-art techniques in this area. Furthermore, complicated models that were first learned for certain tasks can be easily adapted to complete new tasks by using transfer-learning approaches. However, deep learning-based categorization techniques could experience overfitting issues, particularly in cases where the dataset is small. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the performances of certain deep learning models to classify breast cancer images and to study the effects of data augmentation techniques, such as image rotation or displacement when utilizing a transfer learning approach. Using certain image datasets, the ResNet18, Resnet50, and VGG16 models demonstrated accuracy improvements, according to our experimental results.",
