        "abstract": "One of the main concerns in multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) is to detect the relationship between observed items and latent traits, which is typically addressed by the exploratory analysis and factor rotation techniques. Recently, an EM-based L1-penalized log-likelihood method (EML1) is proposed as a vital alternative to factor rotation. Based on the observed test response data, EML1 can yield a sparse and interpretable estimate of the loading matrix. However, EML1 suffers from high computational burden. In this paper, we consider the coordinate descent algorithm to optimize a new weighted log-likelihood, and consequently propose an improved EML1 (IEML1) which is more than 30 times faster than EML1. The performance of IEML1 is evaluated through simulation studies and an application on a real data set related to the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire is used to demonstrate our methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Sumatra Island is one of the islands that are prone to earthquakes because Sumatra Island is located at the confluence of three plates, namely the large Indo-Australian plate, the Eurasian plate and the Philippine plate. In general, the number of earthquake events follows the Poisson distribution, but there are cases where there is overdispersion in the Poisson distribution. The Poisson Hidden Markov Models (PHMMs) method is used to overcome overdispersion, then applying the Expectation-Maximization Algorithm (EM algorithm) to each model to obtain the estimated parameters. From the models obtained, the best model will be selected based on the smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. The data used is secondary data on earthquake events on the island of Sumatra from January 2000 to December 2022 with a depth of ≤ 70 Km and a magnitude of ≥ 4.4 Mw. From the research, the model with m = 3 is the best estimation model with an AIC value of 1503,286. From the best model, estimates are obtained for Poisson Hidden Markov Models with an average occurrence of earthquakes of 5.7633 ≈ 6 events within one month.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nActive learning seeks to reduce the amount of data required to fit the parameters of a model, thus forming an important class of techniques in modern machine learning. However, past work on active learning has largely overlooked latent variable models, which play a vital role in neuroscience, psychology, and a variety of other engineering and scientific disciplines. Here we address this gap by proposing a novel framework for maximum-mutual-information input selection for discrete latent variable regression models. We first apply our method to a class of models known as mixtures of linear regressions (MLR). While it is well known that active learning confers no advantage for linear-gaussian regression models, we use Fisher information to show analytically that active learning can nevertheless achieve large gains for mixtures of such models, and we validate this improvement using both simulations and real-world data. We then consider a powerful class of temporally structured latent variable models given by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with generalized linear model (GLM) observations, which has recently been used to identify discrete states from animal decision-making data. We show that our method substantially reduces the amount of data needed to fit GLM-HMMs and outperforms a variety of approximate methods based on variational and amortized inference. Infomax learning for latent variable models thus offers a powerful approach for characterizing temporally structured latent states, with a wide variety of applications in neuroscience and beyond.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIt is difficult to assess the quality of a fitted model in unsupervised learning problems. Latent variable models, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian mixture models, are often trained with likelihood-based approaches. In the scope of Goodhart’s law, when a metric becomes a target it ceases to be a good metric and therefore we should not use likelihood to assess the quality of the fit of these models. The solution we propose is a new metric for model comparison or regularization that relies on moments. The key idea is to study the difference between the data moments and the model moments using a matrix norm, such as the Frobenius norm. We first show how to use this new metric for model comparison and then for regularization. We show that our proposed metric is faster to compute and has a smaller variance than the commonly used procedure of drawing samples from the fitted distribution. We conclude this article with a demonstration of both applications and we discuss our findings and future work.",

The issue is especially problematic for reproducibility and for model checks that involve prior distributions, including prior predictive assessment and Bayes factors. In these cases, one might be assessing the wrong model, casting doubt on the relevance of the results. The most straightforward solution to the issue sometimes involves use of informative prior distributions. We explore other solutions and make recommendations for practice.",

LV Forest estimates unbiased latent variable scores based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models with ordinal and/or numerical response variables. Through parametric model restrictions paired with a nonparametric tree-based machine learning approach, LV Forest estimates latent variable scores using models that are unbiased with respect to relevant subgroups in the population. This way, estimated latent variable scores are interpretable with respect to systematic influences of covariates without being biased by these variables. By building a tree ensemble, LV Forest takes parameter heterogeneity in latent variable modeling into account to capture subgroups with both good model fit and stable parameter estimates. We apply LV Forest to simulated data with heterogeneous model parameters as well as to real large-scale survey data. We show that LV Forest improves the accuracy of score estimation if parameter heterogeneity is present. ",

This approach, which was originally described by Budescu, has recently been extended to use with structural equation models examining relationships among latent variables. Research demonstrated that this approach yields accurate results for latent variable models involving normally distributed indicator variables and correctly specified models. The purpose of the current simulation study was to compare the use of this DA approach to a method based on observed regression DA and DA when the latent variable model is estimated using two-stage least squares for latent variable models with categorical indicators and/or model misspecification. Results indicated that the DA approach for latent variable models can provide accurate ordering of the variables and correct hypothesis selection when indicators are categorical and models are misspecified. A discussion of implications from this study is provided. ",

However, their training techniques, like the popular Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, are notoriously sensitive to parameter initialization and often suffer from bad local optima that could be arbitrarily worse than the optimal. To address the long-lasting bad-local-optima challenge, we draw inspiration from the recent ground-breaking foundation models and propose to leverage their underlying big learning principle to upgrade the EM. Specifically, we present the Big Learning EM (BigLearn-EM), an EM upgrade that simultaneously performs joint, marginal, and orthogonally transformed marginal matchings between data and model distributions. Through simulated experiments, we empirically show that the BigLearn-EM is capable of delivering the optimal with high probability; comparisons on benchmark clustering datasets further demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages over existing techniques.

More specially, third-order here means that there exist three different orders of latent variables and certain amounts of observed variables. The main challenge for third-order model lies in the estimation of unknown path and loading coefficients due to the complex structure inside. Our paper proposes a new estimation algorithm for third-order model under the framework of partial least square. On the above basis, we further develop a new partial least square third-order model with quantile regression and propose a new modified algorithm correspondingly. This kind of model can capture the relations among different variables at different quantiles. In addition, we develop another new partial least square third-order model with varying coefficients, which reflecting the dynamic relations among different latent variables and observed variables.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nInternational large-scale assessments (ILSAs) play an important role in educational research and policy making. They collect valuable data on education quality and performance development across many education systems, giving countries the opportunity to share techniques, organisational structures, and policies that have proven efficient and successful. To gain insights from ILSA data, we identify non-cognitive variables associated with students’ academic performance. This problem has three analytical challenges: (a) academic performance is measured by cognitive items under a matrix sampling design; (b) there are many missing values in the non-cognitive variables; and (c) multiple comparisons due to a large number of non-cognitive variables. We consider an application to the Programme for International Student Assessment, aiming to identify non-cognitive variables associated with students’ performance in science. We formulate it as a variable selection problem under a general latent variable model framework and further propose a knockoff method that conducts variable selection with a controlled error rate for false selections.",

        "abstract": "\n                        <p>Text processing is an important task in various machine learning applications. One among the applications is Sentiment analysis. However, the presence of sarcasm makes it difficult for analyzing the sentiment of the statement. In the current scenario, the amount of sarcastic statements in any social media platform is high taking the forms of memes, comments, trolls etc. Hence it is important to identify sarcasm to preserve the polarity of any given statement. Sarcasm usually means the opposite of what the sentence seems to convey. While the existing works in literature have focused on detecting sarcasm, the proposed model, in addition to that, determines the levels of sarcasm present in the text, which will aid in finding the level of harshness present in the statement. In this work, an unsupervised learning model, Conditional Random Field model based Modified Expectation Maximization (CRF-MEM) algorithm has been proposed for detecting sarcasm in tweets. The proposed model aims to overcome the limitation present in the traditional EM algorithm, the random assignment factor, with the proposed aspect relationship value. Experimental results showed that the proposed CRF-MEM achieved an accuracy of 91.89% whereas the traditional EM displayed an accuracy of 80% in detecting sarcasm from text.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    ",

        "abstract": "The Long-Term Evaluation (LTE) based Fourth Generation (4G) and Fifth Generation (5G) communications require higher data rates to satisfy the requirements of user equipment. However, it is a difficult task for conventional Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems to deliver the highest throughput and data rates to end users. Additionally, an increase in data rates led to increased power consumption, which decreased spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper focuses on the implementation of the Doubly Selective with Expectation Maximization (DSEM) channel estimation method for Massive-MIMO based Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems. Here, the DSEM scheme divides the channel into expectation and maximization vectors based on antenna diversity. Further, time sample and frequency band base dual channel analysis are performed to maintain the synchronization in the receiver. The simulations conducted using MatlabR2018a show that base station (BS) capacity, user equipment capacity, uplink (UL)-Spectrum Efficiency (SE), and downlink (DL)-SE performance measures are improved in Massive-MIMO-NOMA systems using DSEM channel estimation and shows the superior performance than state of art approaches.",

One of these challenges is the harmonization of high-dimensional unbalanced and heterogeneous data. In this manuscript, we propose a statistical approach to combine incomplete and partially-overlapping pieces of covariance matrices that come from independent experiments. We assume that the data are a random sample of partial covariance matrices sampled from Wishart distributions and we derive an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation. We demonstrate the properties of our method by (i) using simulation studies and (ii) using empirical datasets. In general, being able to make inferences about the covariance of variables not observed in the same experiment is a valuable tool for data analysis since covariance estimation is an important step in many statistical applications, such as multivariate analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.",

        "abstract": "The integration of discrete algorithmic components in deep learning architectures has numerous applications. Recently, Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation, a class of gradient estimators for discrete exponential family distributions, was proposed by combining implicit differentiation through perturbation with the path-wise gradient estimator. However, due to the finite difference approximation of the gradients, it is especially sensitive to the choice of the finite difference step size, which needs to be specified by the user. In this work, we present Adaptive IMLE (AIMLE), the first adaptive gradient estimator for complex discrete distributions: it adaptively identifies the target distribution for IMLE by trading off the density of gradient information with the degree of bias in the gradient estimates. We empirically evaluate our estimator on synthetic examples, as well as on Learning to Explain, Discrete Variational Auto-Encoders, and Neural Relational Inference tasks. In our experiments, we show that our adaptive gradient estimator can produce faithful estimates while requiring orders of magnitude fewer samples than other gradient estimators.",

        "abstract": "\nPurpose:\nTo explore the influence of initial guess or estimate (uniform as “ones” and “zeros” vs. filtered back projection [FBP] image) as an input image for maximum likelihood expectation–maximization (MLEM) tomographic reconstruction algorithm and provide the curves of error or convergence for each of these three initial estimates.\n\n\nMethods:\nTwo phantoms, created as digital images, were utilized: one was a simple noiseless object and the other was a more complicated, noise-degraded object of the section of lower thorax in a matrix of 256 × 256 pixels. Both underwent radon transform or forward projection process and the corresponding sinograms were generated. For filtering during tomographic image reconstruction, ramp and Butterworth filters, as high-pass and low-pass ones, were applied to images. The second phantom (lower thorax) was radon-transformed and the resulting sinogram was degraded by noise. As initial guess or estimate images, in addition to FBP tomographic image, two uniform images, one with all pixels having a value of 1 (“ones”) and the other with all having zero (“zeros”), were created. The three initial estimates (FBP, ones, and zeros) were reconstructed with iterative MLEM tomographic reconstruction (with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 iterations). The difference between the object and the updated slice was calculated at the end of each iteration (as error matrix), and the mean squared error (MSE) was computed and plotted separately or in conjunction with the MSE curves of other initial estimates. All computations were implemented in MATLAB software.\n\n\nResults:\nThe results of ones and zeros seemed strikingly similar. The curves of uniform ones and uniform zeros were so close to each other that overlap near-perfectly. However, in the FBP slice as an initial estimate, the resulting tomographic slice was similar with a much higher extent to the object even after 1 or 2 iterations. The pattern of convergence for all three curves was roughly similar. The normalized MSE decreased sharply up to 5 iterations and then, after 10 iterations, the curves reached a plateau until 32 iterations. For the phantom of the lower thorax section with its noise-degraded sinogram, similar to the pattern observed for simple disk-shaped phantom, the curves (normalized MSE) fell sharply up to 10 iterations and then rapidly converged thereafter until 64 iterations.\n\n\nConclusion:\nSimilar results are observed when choosing different initial guesses or estimates (uniform vs. FBP) as the starting point, based on the error calculation using MSE. The algorithm converges almost similarly for all initial estimates. Therefore, selecting a uniform initial guess image can be an appropriate choice and may be preferred over an FBP image. Reducing the processing time can be a valid reason for this choice.\n",

Under the basis of the observable canonical form of the bilinear model, the system output can be written as a regressive form, and a bilinear state observer is applied to estimate the unknown states. To eliminate the influence of outliers and time‐varying delays on parameter estimation, we employ the Student's  distribution to deal with the measurement noise and use a first‐order Markov chain to model the delays. In the framework of expectation‐maximization (EM) algorithm, the unknown parameters, delays, noise variance, states and transition probability matrix can be estimated iteratively. A numerical simulation and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good immunity against outliers and time‐varying delays and offers good estimation accuracy for the bilinear SSM.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of how COVID-19 deaths observed in an oncology clinical trial can be consistently taken into account in typical survival estimates. We refer to oncological patients since there is empirical evidence of strong correlation between COVID-19 and cancer deaths, which implies that COVID-19 deaths cannot be treated simply as non-informative censoring, a property usually required by the classical survival estimators. We consider the problem in the framework of the widely used Kaplan–Meier (KM) estimator. Through a counterfactual approach, an algorithmic method is developed allowing to include COVID-19 deaths in the observed data by mean-imputation. The procedure can be seen in the class of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms and will be referred to as Covid-Death Mean-Imputation (CoDMI) algorithm. We discuss the CoDMI underlying assumptions and the convergence issue. The algorithm provides a completed lifetime data set, where each Covid-death time is replaced by a point estimate of the corresponding virtual lifetime. This complete data set is naturally equipped with the corresponding KM survival function estimate and all available statistical tools can be applied to these data. However, mean-imputation requires an increased variance of the estimates. We then propose a natural extension of the classical Greenwood’s formula, thus obtaining expanded confidence intervals for the survival function estimate. To illustrate how the algorithm works, CoDMI is applied to real medical data extended by the addition of artificial Covid-death observations. The results are compared with the estimates provided by the two naïve approaches which count COVID-19 deaths as censoring or as deaths by the disease under study. In order to evaluate the predictive performances of CoDMI an extensive simulation study is carried out. The results indicate that in the simulated scenarios CoDMI is roughly unbiased and outperforms the estimates obtained by the naïve approaches. A user-friendly version of CoDMI programmed in R is freely available.",

Their performance is examined through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study where they are employed to estimate latent class, hidden Markov, and stochastic block models and compared with the standard EM and VEM algorithms. We observe a significant increase in the chance to reach global maximum of the target function and a high accuracy of the estimated parameters for each model.

One such method estimates both the ICF and latent variable time-course simultaneously, and another method establishes the ICF first then models the latent variable directly. To date, a direct comparison of the “simultaneous” and “sequential” methodologies described in this work has not yet been systematically investigated. Item parameters from a graded response IRT model developed from Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) study data were used as simulation parameters. Each method was evaluated under the following conditions: (i) with and without drug effect and (ii) slow progression rate with smaller sample size and rapid progression rate with larger sample size. Overall, the methods performed similarly, with low bias and good precision for key parameters and hypothesis testing for drug effect. The ICF parameters were well determined when the model was correctly specified, with an increase in precision in the scenario with rapid progression. In terms of drug effect, both methods had large estimation bias for the slow progression rate; however, this bias can be considered small relative to overall progression rate. Both methods demonstrated type 1 error control and similar discrimination between model with and without drug effect. The simultaneous method was slightly more precise than the sequential method while the sequential method was more robust towards longitudinal model misspecification and offers practical advantages in model building.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionInterpretable latent variable models that probabilistically link behavioral observations to an underlying latent process have increasingly been used to draw inferences on cognition from observed behavior. The latent process usually connects experimental variables to cognitive computation. While such models provide important insights into the latent processes generating behavior, one important aspect has often been overlooked. They may also be used to generate precise and falsifiable behavioral predictions as a function of the modeled experimental variables. In doing so, they pinpoint how experimental conditions must be designed to elicit desired behavior and generate adaptive experiments.MethodsThese ideas are exemplified on the process of delay discounting (DD). After inferring DD models from behavior on a typical DD task, the models are leveraged to generate a second adaptive DD task. Experimental trials in this task are designed to elicit 9 graded behavioral discounting probabilities across participants. Models are then validated and contrasted to competing models in the field by assessing the ouf-of-sample prediction error.ResultsThe proposed framework induces discounting probabilities on nine levels. In contrast to several alternative models, the applied model exhibits high validity as indicated by a comparably low prediction error. We also report evidence for inter-individual differences with respect to the most suitable models underlying behavior. Finally, we outline how to adapt the proposed method to the investigation of other cognitive processes including reinforcement learning.DiscussionInducing graded behavioral frequencies with the proposed framework may help to highly resolve the underlying cognitive construct and associated neuronal substrates.",

However, methods based on this approach are limited to simple geometric shapes that can be formulated as a linear subspace of line or line element space. The core of this approach is a principal component formulation to find a best-fit approximant to a possibly noisy or impartial surface given as an unordered set of points or point cloud. We expand on this by introducing the Gaussian process latent variable model, a probabilistic non-linear non-parametric dimensionality reduction approach following the Bayesian paradigm. This allows us to find structure in a lower dimensional latent space for the surfaces of interest. We show how this can be applied in surface approximation and unsupervised segmentation to the surfaces mentioned above and demonstrate its benefits on surfaces that deviate from these.

The new test, with a properly calibrated threshold, has a well-controlled type-I error. In the case of certain models with low-dimensional latent structures and high-dimensional observations, our test significantly outperforms the relative maximum mean discrepancy test, which is based on samples from the models and does not exploit the latent structure.",

        "abstract": "Latent variable models are a popular class of models in statistics. Combined with neural networks to improve their expressivity, the resulting deep latent variable models have also found numerous applications in machine learning. A drawback of these models is that their likelihood function is intractable so approximations have to be carried out to perform inference. A standard approach consists of maximizing instead an evidence lower bound (ELBO) obtained based on a variational approximation of the posterior distribution of the latent variables. The standard ELBO can, however, be a very loose bound if the variational family is not rich enough. A generic strategy to tighten such bounds is to rely on an unbiased low-variance Monte Carlo estimate of the evidence. We review here some recent importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo and sequential Monte Carlo strategies that have been proposed to achieve this.\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Bayesian inference: challenges, perspectives, and prospects’.",

        "abstract": "Early detection of diseases in men and women can improve treatment and reduce the risk involved in human life. Nowadays techniques which are non-invasive in nature are popularly used to detect the various types of diseases. Histopathological analysis plays a major role in finding the nature of the disease through medical images. Manual interpretation of these medical imaging takes time, is tedious, subjective, and can have human errors. It has also been discovered that the interpretation of these images varies amongst diagnostic labs. As computer power and memory capacity have increased, methodologies and medical image processing techniques have been developed to interpret and analyse these images as a substitute for human involvement. The challenge lies in devising an efficient pre-processing technique that helps in analysing, processing and preparing the medical image for further diagnostics. This research provides a hybrid technique that reduces noise in the NITFI medical image by using a 2D adaptive median filter at level 1. The edges of the filtered medical image are preserved using the modified CLAHE algorithm which preserves the local contrast of the image. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm extracts the ROI part of the image which helps in easy and accurate identification of the disease. All the three steps are run over the 3D image slices of a NIFTI image. The proposed method proves that it achieves close to ideal RMSE, PSNR and UQI values as well as achieves an average runtime of 37.193 seconds for EM per slice.",

This paper considers the Weibull PH model under the current status data and introduces the Poisson latent variables to augment the data, then uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters. The EM algorithm is compared with the Newton–Raphson (NR) algorithm from several perspectives in the simulation studies, and the results show that the proposed method has several highlights, such as computational simplicity, improved convergence stability, and overall estimator results that are either comparable or slightly better in terms of bias. Furthermore, the performance of the Weibull PH model and the semi-parametric PH model is compared under two simulation scenarios, and two standard model selection criteria are used for model selection. The results indicate that the Weibull PH model has significant advantages when failure time follows a Weibull distribution. Lastly, the Weibull PH model along with EM algorithm is applied to lung tumor data and intraocular lens (IOL) calcification data with the aim of assessing the impact of covariates, including environmental factors and gender, on event timing and risk.",

A significant number of psychological effects require (feelings) to be produced, directly releasing human emotions.

The proposed line of inquiry focuses on developing a reliable model incorporating neurophysiological data into actual feelings. Any change in emotional affect will directly elicit a response in the body's physiological systems. This approach is named after the notion of Gaussian mixture models (GMM).

In terms of statistical parameters such as population mean and standard deviation, the suggested method is evaluated compared to a technique considered to be state-of-the-art.

For this purpose, a model was developed on the basis of expectation–maximization machine learning (ML) and nanoindentation mapping. Using this model, it is possible to predict and interpret the microstructural features of solder joints through the micromechanical variations (i.e. elastic modulus) of interconnection. According to the results, the classification of Sn-based matrix, intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and the grain boundaries with specified elastic-modulus ranges was successfully performed through the ML model. However, it was detected some overestimations in regression process when the interfacial regions got thickened in the microstructure. The ML outcomes also revealed that the thermal-cycling evolution was accompanied with stiffening and growth of IMCs; while the spatial portion of Sn-based matrix decreased in the microstructure. It was also figured out that the stiffness gradient becomes intensified in the treated samples, which is consistent with this fact that the thermal cycling increases the mechanical mismatch between the matrix and the IMCs.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: A common way for computing test-retest reliability is Intra Class Correlation which was developed for continuous variables. But it widely used to assess test-retest reliability in questionnaires with Likert scales. Most of the time consecutive numbers regarded as option labels of a question. If the probability of choosing options be the same, using this method is logic, otherwise it is not. Therefore, in this study a modified estimator of ICC is proposed to improve the estimation of ICC for ordinal scale by using latent variable model.\r\nMethods: In this method test-retest answers were considered as bivariate variables and cumulative Probit latent variable model was fitted. A simulation study with N=1500 replicates was conducted to compare the ICC estimations of Likert scale approach with a latent variable approach. Different sample sizes (n=20, 30) was generated with different correlation parameters. The simulations were repeated for questions with 3 and 5 options with different probability of selecting options of a question. After that the two approaches were run on Beck for suicidal ideation questionnaire.\r\nResults: In general the difference between Likert scale approach and latent variable approach were higher in 3 question options compared to 5 and also by increasing sample size and correlation between bivariate data, Root Mean Square Errors and bias were decreased. Assuming different probabilities for options, there was a considerably difference between Root Mean Square Errors, bias and standard deviation of estimation of ICC in two models. Using latent variable approach resulted less bias, SD and Root Mean Square Errors especially in lower sample sizes.\r\nConclusion: Simulations showed when the probability of choosing options of a question are skewed, using this method reduced Root Mean Square Errors especially when the options are less. This method was affected more on standard deviation compare to bias of estimations.\r\n ",

        "abstract": " Testing for differential item functioning (DIF) has undergone rapid statistical developments recently. Moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) allows for simultaneous testing of DIF among multiple categorical and continuous covariates (e.g., sex, age, ethnicity, etc.), and regularization has shown promising results for identifying DIF among many covariates. However, computationally inefficient estimation methods have hampered practical use of the regularized MNFLA method. We develop a penalized expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm with soft- and firm-thresholding to more efficiently estimate regularized MNLFA parameters. Simulation and empirical results show that, compared to previous implementations of regularized MNFLA, the penalized EM algorithm is faster, more flexible, and more statistically principled. This method also yields similar recovery of DIF relative to previous implementations, suggesting that regularized DIF detection remains a preferred approach over traditional methods of identifying DIF.

        "abstract": "In regression modelling, measurement error models are often needed to correct for uncertainty arising from measurements of covariates/predictor variables. The literature on measurement error (or errors-in-variables) modelling is plentiful, however, general algorithms and software for maximum likelihood estimation of models with measurement error are not as readily available, in a form that they can be used by applied researchers without relatively advanced statistical expertise. In this study, we develop a novel algorithm for measurement error modelling, which could in principle take any regression model fitted by maximum likelihood, or penalised likelihood, and extend it to account for uncertainty in covariates. This is achieved by exploiting an interesting property of the Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm, namely that it can be expressed as an iteratively reweighted maximisation of complete data likelihoods (formed by imputing the missing values). Thus we can take any regression model for which we have an algorithm for (penalised) likelihood estimation when covariates are error-free, nest it within our proposed iteratively reweighted MCEM algorithm, and thus account for uncertainty in covariates. The approach is demonstrated on examples involving generalized linear models, point process models, generalized additive models and capture–recapture models. Because the proposed method uses maximum (penalised) likelihood, it inherits advantageous optimality and inferential properties, as illustrated by simulation. We also study the model robustness of some violations in predictor distributional assumptions. Software is provided as the refitME package on R, whose key function behaves like a refit() function, taking a fitted regression model object and re-fitting with a pre-specified amount of measurement error.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional (2D) active target localization is generally hindered by the high temporal and spatial sidelobe levels in snapshot-deficient scenarios, where the adaptive approaches undergo performance degeneration since they require many snapshots to build the sample covariance matrix. Aiming at working robustly in snapshot-deficient active scenarios, a 2D expectation-maximization-based vertical-time-record (EMVTR) approach is proposed to compensate for the snapshot deficiency and achieve the high-resolution active localization by reconstructing the covariance matrix using estimated hyperparameters, i.e., signal powers and noise variance. With the short-time Fourier transform, the proposed approach could reduce echoes' temporal correlation and attain robust beam-time localization in mild reverberation. The multi-frequency EMVTR is derived from the single-frequency case to improve the weak echo localization. The performance is evaluated by considering single and multiple target echoes in simulation and a single moving target with tank experimental data. The results manifest the proposed EMVTR's robustness and effectiveness for the 2D active localization in snapshot-deficient scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Different data types often occur in psychological and educational measurement such as computer‐based assessments that record performance and process data (e.g., response times and the number of actions). Modelling such data requires specific models for each data type and accommodating complex dependencies between multiple variables. Generalized linear latent variable models are suitable for modelling mixed data simultaneously, but estimation can be computationally demanding. A fast solution is to use Laplace approximations, but existing implementations of joint modelling of mixed data types are limited to ordinal and continuous data. To address this limitation, we derive an efficient estimation method that uses first‐ or second‐order Laplace approximations to simultaneously model ordinal data, continuous data, and count data. We illustrate the approach with an example and conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the method in terms of estimation efficiency, convergence, and parameter recovery. The results suggest that the second‐order Laplace approximation achieves a higher convergence rate and produces accurate yet fast parameter estimates compared to the first‐order Laplace approximation, while the time cost increases with higher model complexity. Additionally, models that consider the dependence of variables from the same stimulus fit the empirical data substantially better than models that disregarded the dependence.",

There is a need to understand the functional consequences of differential splicing, which could be supported by the generation of accurate and comprehensive isoform-specific gene ontology annotations.ResultsWe present isoform interpretation, a method that uses expectation–maximization to infer isoform-specific functions based on the relationship between sequence and functional isoform similarity. We predicted isoform-specific functional annotations for 85 617 isoforms of 17 900 protein-coding human genes spanning a range of 17 430 distinct gene ontology terms. Comparison with a gold-standard corpus of manually annotated human isoform functions showed that isoform interpretation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. We provide experimental evidence that functionally related isoforms predicted by isoform interpretation show a higher degree of domain sharing and expression correlation than functionally related genes. We also show that isoform sequence similarity correlates better with inferred isoform function than with gene-level function.Availability and implementationSource code, documentation, and resource files are freely available under a GNU3 license at https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/isopretEM and https://zenodo.org/record/7594321.",

The complex relationship between these disturbance variables results in non-Gaussian noise distribution, which cannot be handled by the classical Kalman filter. For the accurate and real-time observation of ROV climbing, and, at the same time, to reduce the influence of the uncertainty of the noise distribution, the ROV state filter is designed based on the mixture of Gaussian model theory with the expectation-maximization cubature particle filter (EM-MOGCPF). The EM-MOGCPF considers different sensor measurement noises, and the addition of mixture of Gaussian (MOG) improves the fineness and real-time properties, while the expectation-maximization (EM) reduces the complexity of the algorithm. To estimate the ROV xyz-axis and yaw angular states, we establish a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) ROV kinetics model, which uses a simulation platform for multiple sea state degrees. The results show that the EM-MOGCPF effectively improves the estimation accuracy and exhibits strong adaptability to nonlinear and non-Gaussian environments. We believe that this algorithm holds promise in solving the state estimation challenge in these difficult environments.",

Unfortunately, this is a very complex task because several issues often arise in the collected data, due to the sensitivity of the topic. In sample surveys, one major problem is misclassification. Without appropriate adjustments, inference would provide biased estimates, the reason being the concealing of undeclared status. In order to overcome such problem, we developed a methodology based on a Expectation–Maximization algorithm that accounts for misclassification due to dishonest answering. Through the proposed approach, we are able to estimate the prevalence of UW and its determinants. The reliability of the methodology is validated through an extensive simulation study.

However, it remains unknown how best to operationalize hierarchically related psychopathology dimensions during criterion validity tests. In a series of simulations, we evaluated the performance of latent-variable (i.e., structural equation modeling [SEM]) and factor-score representations of hierarchical psychopathology constructs in criterion validity analyses. In models based on continuously distributed psychopathology indicators (e.g., symptom composites), SEM and factor-score methods both tended to yield unbiased estimates of criterion validity coefficients. In contrast, for models based on dichotomous indicators (e.g., categorical diagnoses), SEM led to more accurate estimates than factor scores in most cases. We offer recommendations for psychopathology researchers based on these results and provide an R function ( https://osf.io/u3j5d/ ) that investigators can use to apply the approaches studied here in real-world data sets.

        "abstract": "AbstractWith linear dependency between the explanatory variables, partial least squares (PLS) regression is commonly used for regression analysis. If the response variable correlates to a high degree with the explanatory variables, a model with excellent predictive ability can usually be obtained. Ranking of variable importance is commonly used to interpret the model and sometimes this interpretation guides further experimentation. For instance, when analyzing natural product extracts for bioactivity, an underlying assumption is that the highest ranked compounds represent the best candidates for isolation and further testing. A problem with this approach is that in most cases, the number of compounds is larger than the number of samples (and usually much larger) and that the concentrations of the compounds correlate. Furthermore, compounds may interact as synergists or as antagonists. If the modeling process does not account for this possibility, the interpretation can be thoroughly wrong because unmodeled variables that strongly influence the response will give rise to confounding of a first‐order PLS model and send the experimenter on a wrong track. We show the consequences of this by a practical example from natural product research. Furthermore, we show that by including the possibility of interactions between explanatory variables, visualization using a selectivity ratio plot may provide model interpretation that can be used to make inferences.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis study examined the heterogeneity in temporal shifts of unrealistic optimism (UO) by analyzing students’ grade expectation throughout a semester. UO was defined as the gap between students’ estimated and current course grades, with a larger gap indicating higher UO. Final course grades were viewed as the outcome of UO. A total of 206 participants completed baseline measures of personal factors during the first week of the semester and repeated measurements at five subsequent time points. Using person-centered trajectory analysis (e.g., latent growth mixture models), we identified three distinct UO trajectories: UO-Persistent (6.8%; consistently high UO), UO-Decreasing (26.2%; diminishing UO), and Realistic (67.0%; consistently low UO). High perfectionistic standards and dysphoria predicted UO-Persistent group membership, while perfectionistic discrepancy, self-efficacy, and belief in optimism's power did not. The Realistic group achieved higher final grades than the UO-Decreasing group. Unexpectedly, no difference was found in final grades between the strongest UO group (i.e., UO-Persistent) and other two groups. These findings suggest that UO's temporal shift is not a unitary construct, and distinct UO patterns may be associated with different academic outcomes. This study underscores the significance of comprehending temporal shifts and employing person-centered analysis in UO related to academic achievement. The discussion addresses both research and practical implications.",

        "abstract": "The mixture of experts (ME) model is effective for multimodal data in statistics and machine learning. To treat non-stationary probabilistic regression, the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model has been proposed, but it may not perform well in some cases due to the limited ability of each Gaussian process (GP) expert. Although the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) and warped Gaussian process (WGP) models are dominant and effective for non-stationary probabilistic regression, they may not be able to handle general non-stationary probabilistic regression in practice. In this paper, we first propose the mixture of warped Gaussian processes (MWGP) model as well as its classification expectation–maximization (CEM) algorithm to address this problem. To overcome the local optimum of the CEM algorithm, we then propose the split and merge CEM (SMC EM) algorithm for MWGP. Experiments were done on synthetic and real-world datasets, which show that our proposed MWGP is more effective than the models used for comparison, and the SMCEM algorithm can solve the local optimum for MWGP.",

        "abstract": "Channel equalization plays a crucial role in single-carrier underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. Recently, a frequency-domain turbo equalization (FDTE) scheme enabled by the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm, was proposed, and it outperformed classic linear minimum mean square error FDTE at acceptable complexity cost. The operation of the VAMP-FDTE requires knowledge of noise power, which is predetermined before the equalization starts. In practice, however, it is difficult to obtain prior knowledge of noise power due to factors of unknown channel estimation errors and dynamic underwater environments. Motivated by this fact, we propose an enhanced VAMP-FDTE scheme, which learns the noise power knowledge during the equalization process via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM-based noise power estimation makes use of intermediate results of the VAMP-FDTE and, thus, only incurs a small extra computational overhead. The improved VAMP-FDTE, named EM-VAMP-FDTE, was tested by experimental data collected in shallow-sea horizontal UWA communication trials with MIMO configuration. It showed better performance than the existing VAMP-FDTE scheme, attributed to the online noise power learning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nObjective. In our previous work on image reconstruction for single-layer collimatorless scintigraphy, we developed the min–min weighted robust least squares (WRLS) optimization algorithm to address the challenge of reconstructing images when both the system matrix and the projection data are uncertain. Whereas the WRLS algorithm has been successful in two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction, expanding it to three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is difficult since the WRLS optimization problem is neither smooth nor strongly-convex. To overcome these difficulties and achieve robust image reconstruction in the presence of system uncertainties and projection noise, we propose a generalized iterative method based on the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) algorithm, hereinafter referred to as the Masked-MLEM algorithm. Approach. In the Masked-MLEM algorithm, only selected subsets (‘masks’) from the system matrix and the projection contribute to the image update to satisfy the constraints imposed by the system uncertainties. We validate the Masked-MLEM algorithm and compare it to the standard MLEM algorithm using experimental data obtained from both collimated and uncollimated imaging instruments, including parallel-hole collimated SPECT, 2D collimatorless scintigraphy, and 3D collimatorless tomography. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations for 3D collimatorless tomography to further validate the effectiveness of the Masked-MLEM algorithm in handling different levels of system uncertainties. Main results. The Masked-MLEM and standard MLEM reconstructions are similar in cases with negligible system uncertainties, whereas the Masked-MLEM algorithm outperforms the standard MLEM algorithm when the system matrix is an approximation. Importantly, the Masked-MLEM algorithm ensures reliable image reconstruction across varying levels of system uncertainties. Significance. With a good choice of system uncertainty and without requiring accurate knowledge of the actual system matrix, the Masked-MLEM algorithm yields more robust image reconstruction than the standard MLEM algorithm, effectively reducing the likelihood of erroneously reconstructing higher activities in regions without radioactive sources.",

        "abstract": "Objective. This paper evaluated a novel, tablet-based neurocognitive and psychomotor test battery for detecting impairment from acute cannabis smoking using advanced quantitative methods. The study was conducted in a state with legal, recreational cannabis use and included participants who use cannabis occasionally or daily, and a no use comparison group. Methods. Participants completed a tablet-based test assessing reaction time, decision making, working memory and spatial-motor performance. The test was completed before and after participants smoked cannabis (or after a rest period in the case of controls). An Exploratory Factor Analysis approach was implemented to reduce dimensionality and evaluate correlations across the four assessed domains. Linear regression models were utilized to quantify associations between factor scores and cannabis use groups (daily vs. occasional vs. no use). Results. Seven factors were identified explaining 56.7% of the variance among the 18 measures. Regression models of the change in factors after cannabis smoking indicated those who use cannabis daily demonstrated poorer performance on a latent factor termed Displaced and Delayed (standardized coefficient 0.567, 95% CI: 0.178, 0.955; P = 0.005) compared to those with no use. Those who use cannabis occasionally exhibited a decline in performance on a latent factor termed Recall and Reaction (standardized coefficient 0.714, 95% CI: 0.092, 1.336; P = 0.025) compared to no use.  Conclusions. This analysis demonstrates an innovative, quantitative approach to study how cannabis consumption affects neurocognitive and psychomotor performance. Results demonstrated that acute cannabis use is associated with changes in neurocognitive and psychomotor performance, with differences based on the pattern of occasional or daily use.",

The purpose is to find the most influential individual within a society with a limited number of initial nodes. With the increasing use of social networks these years, Understanding and using forceful diffusion will spread social events or innovations far more widely than the conventional perspective of communication. Many studies have focused on providing algorithmic methods, ignoring the study of finding the optimal point. Although it is still difficult for computer community to settle massive influence maximization issues computationally, it presents a significant opportunity to build operations research-based models, approaches, and analyses at this interface. In the current research, the influence maximization problem is investigated as a discrete optimization issue on social networks. It focuses on the creation of precise techniques for resolving massive cases near the optimal and will provide two classical diffusion models describing the propagation of influence in networks. Finally, given the additional constraints considered, an extension of the trigger model with effective analysis is proposed.",

Psychometric research is an underexplored avenue with the potential to further our understanding of the mechanisms and traits underlying bilingual experiences. Here, we developed and validated a social network questionnaire to measure sociolinguistic features in 212 individuals via personal social network. Confirmatory factor analysis examined the measurement structure of the variables. Compared to a one-factor model, the best fitting model was a two-factor model in which the language experience of the individual (i.e., ego) and the language experience of the individual's network (i.e., alters) were correlated latent factors under which aspects of the bilingual experience loaded. Additional analyses revealed other potential ways to examine the data in future analyses. These results provide the first measurement model of bilingual experiences, and provide support for theoretical accounts suggesting differential neuropsychological outcomes based on individual bilingual variability. The results also support the use of social network tools to capture differences in bilingualism.",

Based on the QR factorization, the problem is reformulated as two novel trace maximization problems, each of which has double variables with unitary constraints or orthogonal constraints. Theoretically, we show that the arbitrarily prescribed extreme generalized singular values and associated triplets of generalized singular vectors can be determined by the global solutions of the constrained trace optimization problems. Then we propose a geometric inexact Newton–conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) method for solving their equivalent trace minimization problems over the Riemannian manifold of all fixed-rank partial isometries. The proposed method can extract not only the prescribed extreme generalized singular values but also associated triplets of generalized singular vectors. Under some mild assumptions, we establish the global and quadratic convergence of the proposed method. Finally, numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show the effectiveness and high accuracy of our method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPhysical resilience – rebound in relevant functioning and biomarkers following a health stressor – is hypothesized to be rooted in the level of fitness of stress-response physiology defining one’s “physiological resilience capacity” (PRC). This physiology forms a dynamical system comprising specific modules (the individual stress response systems and their underlying components) and their dynamic interactions with each other via feedback and other protocols. Such a system can be modeled using differential equations whose parameters may then define the PRC. We do not yet know how to measure these parameters directly, however. Rather, they are conceptually defined “constructs” which must be inferred using indirect measures—ideally, stimulus response data probing multiple aspects of the relevant physiology. Latent variable models are ideally suited to this setting. Two challenges for their application in studies of resilience are presented: (1) Integrating specific scientific knowledge on the dynamical systems in modeling the co-distribution of the indirect measures. (2) Synergizing such models’ advantages for construct measurement with advantages of machine learning approaches to optimize accuracy for predicting resilient outcomes by inferred PRC. Challenges and their proposed solutions are illustrated using multifaceted stimulus response data being collected in an ongoing investigation on the physiological basis of resilience to clinical stressors in older adults, the Study of Physical Resilience in agING. The work aims to produce physiologically rooted measures providing effective risk predictors for older adults facing impending stressors as well as intervention candidates by which to promote PRC in the longer term.",

        "abstract": " High-resolution and high-fidelity seismic inversion imaging is one of the core issues of lithologic reservoir exploration. As a linearization subproblem of full-waveform inversion, least-squares migration (LSM) can obtain inversion results with more reliable amplitude, better resolution, and fewer artifacts that can be solved in either the data domain or image domain. For data-domain LSM, the calculation of the data-domain iteration can be very computationally intensive. In practical situations, the convexity of the cost function of LSM could be poor, resulting in slow or even nonconvergence iteration, so the ideal inversion imaging results cannot be reached. The image-domain LSM (ID-LSM) follows the logic of image deblurring, which realizes the effects of LSM in another way. The key problem of ID-LSM is to calculate a reliable Hessian matrix that can be effectively replaced by a set of point-spread functions (PSFs). Affected by the unknown source wavelet, the accuracy of the background velocity, and the accuracy of the forward/migration operator, the calculation results of the Hessian/PSF cannot be accurate. We first illustrate the impact of incorrect Hessian/PSF on ID-LSM through numerical experiments. To eliminate the influence of the inaccuracy of PSF, we develop the ID-LSM problem as a high-dimensional image deconvolution problem. An alternate update strategy of PSF and imaging results is given under the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm by additionally introducing prior information about PSF and the inversion result. Numerical examples of synthetic data and field data verify that our method significantly improves image quality. ",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe imbalance of rural parking supply and demand has a great impact on traffic congestion and environmental pollution, which has attracted the attention of many scholars as well as policymakers. However, most of the current research on parking choice mainly focuses on urban business and residential areas, lacks research on rural parking choice behavior, and focuses on the analysis of observable factors, ignoring the internal relationship with potential variables. Based on this, this study considers the heterogeneity of individuals and uses the random forest algorithm to construct a model of rural residents’ willingness to choose parking with both latent and explicit variables, to explore how much and in what ways individual characteristics and parking characteristics affect rural residents’ parking choices, and to explore parking planning programs and strategies that are truly applicable to rural areas. The results of the study suggest that safety and convenience of the parking environment are key factors influencing the parking choice behavior of rural residents, and can greatly improve the predictive accuracy of the parking willingness model. Upon comparison, it is found that the application of the random forest algorithm is also significantly better than the logit model in terms of prediction effect, indicating that there is a nonlinear effect among the factors influencing the parking choice behavior of rural residents and that the random forest model with the addition of latent variables provides a better explanatory ability for the study of the parking choice behavior of rural residents.",

The aim of this study is to explain the relationship between nurses’ holistic nursing competence, job satisfaction and turnover intention, and the mediating effect of job satisfaction between holistic nursing competence and turnover intention. Design: The cross-sectional design was adopted and explained with a hypothetical model. Methods: The study was conducted between March, 8 and May, 5 2021 in a training and research hospital in Turkey. The research was conducted on 342 voluntary nurses. Percentage, frequency distribution, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and Pearson correlation analysis were benefitted to evaluate the data. Path analysis was used for model testing. p < 0.05 was accepted for significance. Results: The mean scores of the nurses in all scales were moderate. Holistic nursing competence was positively correlated to job satisfaction, but it is detected as negatively and less correlated to turnover intention (p < .05). Job satisfaction played a mediating role between nurses’ holistic nursing competence and their turnover intention (p < .05). Conclusions: It is important to understand nurses’ holistic nursing competencies and job satisfaction and to reduce their intention to leave. These concepts should be taken into account in order to retain professional nurses with holistic nursing competence. ",

It depicts the details of the three types of satisfaction stochastic models. A beauty shop's e-commerce database is used as empirical data for parameter estimates and model comparisons. The model calibration uses both root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the Chi-square test. The results demonstrate that the expectation disconfirmation model has the maximum fitness in the RMSD index, but the lowest goodness of fit in the Chi-square test. In contrast, the ideal point model produces opposite findings on the RMSD index and the Chi-square test. The expectation model, which has a larger number of parameters than the other two models, can be used for elastic changes to explain varied situational elements of pleasure, but it also requires more data to be stable. However, the ideal point model has a simpler structure than the other two models. There is only one parameter to estimate, which makes it easy to apply. However, it is less accurate than the other two models when measuring dynamic satisfaction.",

The application centers around using hourly observations on ride wait times at Disney’s Magic Kingdom to infer how crowded it is at the theme park. Pedagogically, the material is presented in the context of the linear regression model, so the discussion works to enhance students’ understanding of core material, not to introduce new disparate methods. The application provides interesting economic-based insights, like which ride’s wait times are categorically most informative about how crowded it is at the park.",

        "abstract": "The secure operation of smart grids is closely linked to state estimates that accurately reflect the physical characteristics of the grid. However, well-designed false data injection attacks (FDIAs) can manipulate the process of state estimation by injecting malicious data into the measurement data while bypassing the detection of the security system, ultimately causing the results of state estimation to deviate from secure values. Since FDIAs tampering with the measurement data of some buses will lead to error offset, this paper proposes an attack-detection algorithm based on statistical learning according to the different characteristic parameters of measurement error before and after tampering. In order to detect and classify false data from the measurement data, in this paper, we report the model establishment and estimation of error parameters for the tampered measurement data by combining the the k-means++ algorithm with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. At the same time, we located and recorded the bus that the attacker attempted to tamper with. In order to verify the feasibility of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the IEEE 5-bus standard test system and the IEEE 14-bus standard test system were used for simulation analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate that the combined use of the two algorithms can decrease the detection time to less than 0.011883 s and correctly locate the false data with a probability of more than 95%.",

In such cases, their distribution is not of interest. Class‐specific distribution is of interest in the distal outcome model, when the distribution of the external variables is assumed to depend on LC membership. In this paper, we consider a more general formulation, that embeds both the LC regression and the distal outcome models, as is typically done in cluster‐weighted modelling. This allows us to investigate (1) whether the distribution of the external variables differs across classes, (2) whether there are significant direct effects of the external variables on the indicators, by modelling jointly the relationship between the external and the latent variables. We show the advantages of the proposed modelling approach through a set of artificial examples, an extensive simulation study and an empirical application about psychological contracts among employees and employers in Belgium and the Netherlands.",

Accurate and efficient detection of SNVs from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is essential for various applications in genomics and personalized medicine. However, SNV calling methods usually suffer from high computational complexity and limited accuracy. In this context, there is a need for new methods that overcome these limitations and provide fast reliable results.\n\n\nResults\nWe present EMVC-2, a novel method for SNV calling from NGS data. EMVC-2 uses a multi-class ensemble classification approach based on the expectation–maximization algorithm that infers at each locus the most likely genotype from multiple labels provided by different learners. The inferred variants are then validated by a decision tree that filters out unlikely ones. We evaluate EMVC-2 on several publicly available real human NGS data for which the set of SNVs is available, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art variant callers in terms of accuracy and speed, on average.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nEMVC-2 is coded in C and Python, and is freely available for download at: https://github.com/guilledufort/EMVC-2. EMVC-2 is also available in Bioconda.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn analyzing semi-continuous data, two-part model is a widely appreciated tool, in which two components are enclosed to characterize the mixing proportion of zeros and the actual level of positive values in semi-continuous data. The primary interest underlying such a model is primarily to exploit the dependence of the observed covariates on the semi-continuous variables; as such, the exploitation of unobserved heterogeneity is sometimes ignored. In this paper, we extend the conventional two-part regression model to much more general situations where multiple latent factors are considered to interpret the latent heterogeneity arising from the absence of covariates. A structural equation is constructed to describe the interrelationships between the latent factors. Moreover, a general statistical analysis procedure is developed to accommodate semi-continuous, ordered and unordered data simultaneously. A procedure for parameter estimation and model assessment is developed under a Bayesian framework. Empirical results including a simulation study and a real example are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology.",
