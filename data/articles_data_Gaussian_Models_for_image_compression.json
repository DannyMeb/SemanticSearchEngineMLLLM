Marked progress has been made in the area of image compression in the last decade. Image compression removing redundant information in image data is a solution for storage and data transmission problems for huge amounts of data. NNs offer the potential for providing a novel solution to the problem of image compression by its ability to generate an internal data representation. A comparison among various feed-forward back-propagation training algorithms was presented with different compression ratios and different block sizes. The learning methods, the Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm and the Gradient Descent (GD) have been used to perform the training of the network architecture and finally, the performance is evaluated in terms of MSE and PSNR using medical images. The decompressed results obtained using these two algorithms are computed in terms of PSNR and MSE along with performance plots and regression plots from which it can be observed that the LM algorithm gives more accurate results than the GD algorithm.

        "abstract": "There have been many compression standards developed during the past few decades and technological advances has resulted in introducing many methodologies with promising results. As far as PSNR metric is concerned, there is a performance gap between reigning compression standards and learned compression algorithms. Based on research, we experimented using an accurate entropy model on the learned compression algorithms to determine the rate-distortion performance. In this paper, discretized Gaussian Mixture likelihood is proposed to determine the latent code parameters in order to attain a more flexible and accurate model of entropy. Moreover, we have also enhanced the performance of the work by introducing recent attention modules in the network architecture. Simulation results indicate that when compared with the previously existing techniques using high-resolution and Kodak datasets, the proposed work achieves a higher rate of performance. When MS-SSIM is used for optimization, our work generates a more visually pleasant image.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological advances have significantly increased the data volume obtained from deep space exploration missions, making the downlink rate a primary limiting factor. Particularly, JAXA’s Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission encounters this problem when identifying safe and scientifically valuable landing sites on Phobos using high-resolution images. A strategic approach in which we effectively reduce image data volumes without compromising essential scientific information is thus required. In this work, we investigate the influence of image data compression, especially as it concerns the accuracy of generating the local Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) that will be used to determine MMX’s landing sites. We obtain simulated images of Phobos that are compressed using the CCSDS-120 with integer/float-point discrete wavelet transform (DWT), candidate algorithms for the MMX mission. Accordingly, we show that, if the compression ratio is 70% or lower, the effect of image compression remains constrained, and local DTMs can be generated within altitude errors of 40 cm on the surface of Phobos, which is ideal for selecting safe landing spots. We conclude that the compression ratio can be increased as high as 70%, and such compression enables us to facilitate critical phases in the MMX mission even with the limited downlink rate.",

        "abstract": "Image compression research has increased dramatically as a result of the growing demands for image transmission in computer and mobile environments. It is needed especially for reduced storage and efficient image transmission and used to reduce the bits necessary to represent a picture digitally while preserving its original quality. Fractal encoding is an advanced technique of image compression. It is based on the image's forms as well as the generation of repetitive blocks via mathematical conversions. Because of resources needed to compress large data volumes, enormous programming time is needed, therefore Fractal Image Compression's main disadvantage is a very high encoding time where decoding times are extremely fast. An artificial intelligence technique similar to a neural network is used to reduce the search space and encoding time for images by employing a neural network algorithm known as the “back propagation” neural network algorithm. Initially, the image is divided into fixed-size and domains. For each range block its most matched domain is selected, its range index is produced and best matched domains index is the expert system's input, which reduces matching domain blocks in sets of results. This leads in the training of the neural network. This trained network is now used to compress other images which give encoding a lot less time. During the decoding phase, any random original image, converging after some changes to the Fractal image, reciprocates the transformation parameters. The quality of this FIC is indeed demonstrated by the simulation findings. This paper explores a unique neural network FIC that is capable of increasing neural network speed and image quality simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "Processing of satellite images is time-intensive owing to the large surface of the earth and the necessity for high resolution. Compression algorithms are an active research topic since there is no single algorithm which can achieve the best compression at the highest speed. Different compression algorithms need to be explored to enhance the speed of the analysis. Here, a lossless compression scheme using RICE algorithm is implemented using Matlab and Verilog on a satellite image according to the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) recommendation. The RICE algorithm uses a set of variable length codes. The architecture comprises of a Pre-processor, Adaptive entropy coder, Postprocessor and an Inverse mapper. The design has been implemented using Xilinx",

In this chapter, many image compression algorithms have been developed based on various combinations of transforms and encoding techniques. This research work mainly deals with the selection of optimum compression algorithms, suitable for medical images, based on the performance indices like PSNR and compression ratio. In order to find the effectiveness of the developed algorithms, characterization of the CT lung images are performed, before and after compression. The diagnosis of lung cancer is an important application for various medical imaging techniques. In this work, optimal texture features are identified for classification of lung cancer have also been incorporated as a case study. The texture features are extracted from the in CT lung images. BPN is trained to classify the features into normal and cancer. ",
