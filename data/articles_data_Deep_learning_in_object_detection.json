        "abstract": "AbstractImportanceState-of-the art performance is achieved with a deep learning object detection model for acne detection. There is little current research on object detection in dermatology and acne in particular. As such, this work is early in this field and achieves state of the art performance.ObjectiveTrain an object detection model on a publicly available data set of acne photos.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA deep learning model is trained with cross validation on a data set of facial acne photos.Main Outcomes and MeasuresObject detection models for detecting acne for single-class (acne) and multi-class (four severity levels). We train and evaluate the models using standard metrics such as mean average precision (mAP). Then we manually evaluate the model predictions on the test set, and calculate accuracy in terms of precision, recall, F1, true and false positive and negative detections.ResultsWe achieve state-of-the art mean average precision mAP@0.5 value of 37.97 for the single class acne detection task, and 26.50 for the 4-class acne detection task. Moreover, our manual evaluation shows that the single class detection model performs well on the validation set, achieving true positive 93.59 %, precision 96.45 % and recall 94.73 %.Conclusions and RelevanceWe are able to train a high-accuracy acne detection model using only a small publicly available data set of facial acne. Transfer learning on the pre-trained deep learning model yields good accuracy and high degree of transferability to patient submitted photographs. We also note that the training of standard architecture object detection models has given significantly better accuracy than more intricate and bespoke neural network architectures in the existing research literature.Key PointsQuestionCan deep learning-based acne detection models trained on a small data set of publicly available photos of patients with acne achieve high prediction accuracy?FindingsWe find that it is possible to train a reasonably good object detection model on a small, annotated data set of acne photos using standard deep learning architectures.MeaningDeep learning-based object detection models for acne detection can be a useful decision support tools for dermatologists treating acne patients in a digital clinical practice. It can prove a particularly useful tool for monitoring the time evolution of the acne disease state over prolonged time during follow-ups, as the model predictions give a quantifiable and comparable output for photographs over time. This is particularly helpful in teledermatological consultations, as a prediction model can be integrated in the patient-doctor remote communication.",

        "abstract": "Moving object detection plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in traffic surveillance and collision warning systems. However, the high cost of training and slow detection pose significant challenges to the practicality and real-time performance of existing methods. These challenges hinder the practicality and real-time performance of existing methods. The need for a reliable and efficient moving object detection system prompts the search for cost-effective strategies. Enhancing detection speed without sacrificing accuracy is crucial for real-time applications. Overcoming these challenges is essential to advance the field of moving object detection and improve its applicability in various domains. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature on moving object detection, proposes novel strategies to overcome the challenges of high training costs and slow detection. The study emphasizes the importance of reliable speed monitoring systems and advancements in control systems to enhance driver assistance on urban highways. Each frame in the dataset undergoes YOLOv6 processing to detect and classify objects, generating bounding box predictions and class probabilities. Optical flow, specifically the Lucas-Kanade method, is then utilized to compute motion vectors between consecutive frames. These motion vectors facilitate object tracking across frames, enabling refined bounding box positions and improving overall object tracking accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in reducing training costs, improving detection speed, and maintaining a high level of accuracy when compared to existing methods. The paper concludes by summarizing the findings and highlighting the potential of the proposed strategy for precise and reliable moving object recognition in real-world traffic scenarios",

Although many computer vision-based approaches have been presented, no one has yet developed a system that reliably and accurately detects and categorizes objects and animals found in the deep sea. This is largely due to obstacles that scatter and absorb light in an underwater setting. With the introduction of deep learning, scientists have been able to address a wide range of issues, including safeguarding the marine ecosystem, saving lives in an emergency, preventing underwater disasters, and detecting, spooring, and identifying underwater targets. However, the benefits and drawbacks of these deep learning systems remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the dataset that has been utilized in underwater object detection and to present a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithms employed for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nSmall object detection poses a formidable challenge in the field of computer vision, particularly when it comes to analyzing aerial remote sensing images. Despite the rapid development of deep learning and significant progress in detection techniques in natural scenes, the migration of these algorithms to aerial images has not met expectations. This is primarily due to limitations in imaging acquisition conditions, including small target size, viewpoint specificity, background complexity, as well as scale and orientation diversity. Although the increasing application of deep learning-based algorithms to overcome these problems, few studies have summarized the optimization of different deep learning strategies used for small target detection in aerial images. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the application of deep learning methods for small object detection in aerial images. The primary challenges in small object detection in aerial images will be summarized. Next, a meticulous analysis and categorization of the prevailing deep learning optimization strategies employed to surmount the challenges encountered in aerial image detection is undertaken. Following that, we provide a comprehensive presentation of the object detection datasets utilized in aerial remote sensing images, along with the evaluation metrics employed. Additionally, we furnish experimental data pertaining to the currently proposed detection algorithms. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various optimization strategies and potential development trends are discussed. Hopefully, it can provide a reference for researchers in this field.",

        "abstract": "Microfluidics is a multidisciplinary platform that integrates microfabrication, physical chemistry analysis, automation, and microscopy. It has the advantages of precise liquid manipulation, rapid measurements, and real-time visualization at the microscale, which is especially of interest and benefit to microbial studies. Soil Chips are microfabricated microfluidic devices typically made of glass and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), designed to mimic the real soil network and allow real-time visualization and characterization of microbial activity at the micro-scale. They have so far been used to investigate microbial activities, interactions, community composition, and distribution under different conditions in soil analog systems. Challenge comes when working with natural soil samples. Due to mineral aggregates and debris, valuable information such as the abundance of individuals, cell morphology, and the relationship between bacteria and their geochemical and physical environment are difficult to extract via a simple thresholding method. Since microorganisms and microfluidic structures have distinct features from the noisy background that can be easily picked up by our eyes, a biologically inspired convolutional neural network model for object detection is the most suitable tool for this task.We used a small part of data from three different experiments to train a well-developed object detection and segmentation algorithm Mask RCNN and implemented further analysis of bacteria abundance, spatial distribution, and morphological characterization. We are able to plot the distribution of all the detected bacteria including clusters in terms of abundance, size, shape, and index of aggregation. A distinct difference in bacteria characteristics can be observed in the samples acquired from three locations (Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya). We are now planning to extend the classification library to include other microbial groups including fungi, protists, invertebrates, and micro arthropods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe detection of marine organisms is an important part of the intelligent strategy in marine ranch, which requires an underwater robot to detect the marine organism quickly and accurately in the complex ocean environment. Based on the latest deep learning arithmetic, this paper put forward to find the marine organism in a picture or video to construct a real-time objective invention system for marine organisms. The neural network arithmetic： YOLOv4 was employed to extract the deep features of marine organisms, implementing the accurate detection and size detection of different fish can use arithmetic for evaluation in fisheries. Furthermore, improving the architecture of the backbone and the neck connection is called YOLOv4-embedding. As a result, compared with other object detection arithmetic, YOLOv4-embedding object detection arithmetic was better at detection accuracy--higher detection confidence and higher detection ratio than other one-stage object detection arithmetic, EfficientDet-D3 example. The consequence demonstrates that the suggested instrument could implement the rapid invention of different varieties in marine organisms. Compared to the YOLOv4, the mAP 75 of the YOLOv4-embedding achieves an improvement of 2.92% for the marine organism dataset at a rapid rate of ~51 FPS on RTX 3090, 60.8% AP 50 for the MS COCO dataset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPedestrian detection using object detection and deep learning has been found to be effective method for identifying pedestrians in video frames or images accurately. It is more commonly used in many real-time applications, such as security observing systems, autonomous driving systems, and robotics. The combination of deep learning techniques and object detection algorithms allows efficient and robust detection of pedestrians in several real-time scenarios. But it is necessary to improve the detection efficacy for complex environments such as cases with worse visibility due to weather or daytime, crowd scenes, and rare pose samples. Continuous improvement and research in DL algorithms, dataset collection, and training models contribute to accelerating the robustness and accuracy of pedestrian detection systems. Therefore, this study designs a new marine predator algorithm with deep learning-based pedestrian detection and classification (MPADLB-PDC) technique. The objective of the MPADLB-PDC approach lies in the accurate recognition and classification of pedestrians. To achieve this, the MPADLB-PDC technique involves two major processes, namely object detection and classification. In the first stage, the MPADLBPDC technique uses an improved YOLOv7 object detector for the recognition of the objects in the frame. Next, in the second stage, the ensemble classifier comprises three classifiers such as deep feed-forward neural network (DFFNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-term memory (LSTM). To improve the recognition performance of the ensemble classifier, the MPA is used to optimally select the parameters related to it. The simulation outcome of the MPADLB-PDC system was validated on the pedestrian database, and the outcome can be studied interms of various aspects. The simulation values validated the better outcome of the MPADLB-PDC system compared to other approaches.",

From the early traditional methods to today's deep learning methods, the accuracy is getting higher and higher, and the speed is getting faster and faster, which is benefit from deep learning and the continuous development of deep neural networks. Although the research on object detection is constantly developing, there are not many reviews on object detection, so this article will review the object detection after the introduction of deep learning. This article will first introduce the history of object detection, and then focus on a systematic introduction to the development of deep learning object detection in recent years, as well as one-stage detector and two-stage detector in anchor-free and anchor-based. The various methods applied in the stage detector will be sorted out, and the potential problems and future development of object detection will also be analyzed.",
