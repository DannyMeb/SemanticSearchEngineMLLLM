We have compared the performance of our algorithm\nwith the existing algorithm by Hsu, Kakade and Zhang proposed in 2009 and found that it is much more robust if the number of hidden states is overestimated.",

        "abstract": "<p class=\"Abstrak\">Penelitian pengolahan sinyal digital yang berfokus pada pengenalan pembicara telah dimulai sejak beberapa dekade yang lalu, dan telah menghasilkan banyak metode-metode pengenalan pembicara. Di antara algoritma pembentukan koefisien ciri yang telah dikembangkan tersebut, ada dua algoritma yang dapat memberikan akurasi yang tinggi jika diterapkan pada sistem, yaitu <em>Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient</em> (MFCC) dan <em>Wavelet</em>. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menguji dan memilih kanal terbaik dari proses <em>wavelet</em>-MFCC yang dapat dijadikan sebagai koefisien ciri baru untuk diterapkan pada sistem pengenal pembicara. Koefisien ciri baru tersebut kemudian disebut dengan koefisien ciri <em>Wavelet</em>-MFCC. Kofisien ini dibentuk dari merubah kanal hasil dekomposisi <em>wavelet</em>, yaitu kanal aproksimasi (cA), kanal detail (cD), dan penggabungannya (cAcD), menjadi koefisien MFCC. Metode dekomposisi <em>wavelet</em> yang digunakan adalah metode <em>dyadic</em> dengan menerapkan <em>level</em> dekomposisi <em>level</em> 1 dan <em>level</em> 2. Setiap koefisien ciri kemudian menjadi inputan pada sistem pengklasifikasi <em>Hidden Markov Models</em> (HMM). Keluaran dari HMM kemudian dihitung akurasinya dan dianalisis. Dari pengujian yang dilakukan, diperoleh bahwa kanal detail (cD) sebagai ciri dapat memberikan akurasi yang sama dengan menggunakan kanal gabungan (cAcD) dan lebih tinggi dari kanal aproksimasi (cA), dengan akurasi sebesar 95%. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa, kanal detail pada dekomposisi <em>level</em> 1 menyimpan ciri suara dari setiap pembicara sehingga sudah cukup untuk dijadikan sebagai koefisien ciri. Maka, penggunaan dekomposisi <em>level</em> 1 dan kanal detail cD sebagai ciri <em>Wavelet</em>-<em>MFCC</em> pada sistem pengenalan pembicara dapat meringankan dan mempercepat proses komputasi.</p><p class=\"Abstrak\"> </p><p class=\"Abstrak\"><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em></p><p class=\"Abstract\"><em>Research in digital signal that focused on speaker recognition has begun since decades ago, and has resulted many speaker recognition methods. there are two algorithms that can provide high accuracy in recognition system, which are Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) and Wavelet. the aims of this study is to examine and chose the best channel from wavelet-MFCC process that can be used as new feature coefficient, then called as Wavelet-MFCC features coefficient. The coefficient is built by converting the wavelet decomposition channels, which are approximation (cA), detail (cD), and its combination (cAcD), into the MFCC coefficient. Wavelet dyadic decomposition with level 1 and level 2 of decomposition is applied. Each feature coefficient acts as an input to the HMM classifier. The accuracy of the HMM output is calculated, then analyzed. The obtained results show that the detail chanel (cD) achieve equal accuracy as the combination chanel (cAcD), and higher accuracy compared to aproximation channel (cA), with accuracy 95%. Thus, it can be conclude that the detail channel on level 1 decomposition contains features of each speaker's. Then, cD is enough to be used as a Wavelet-MFCC feature. Thus, its implementation in the SRS can ease and speed up the computing process.</em></p><p class=\"Abstrak\"><em><strong><br /></strong></em></p>",

Through the voice, information will be obtained such as gender, age, and even the identity of the speaker. Speaker recognition is a method to narrow down crimes and frauds committed by voice. So that it will minimize the occurrence of faking one's identity. The Method of Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) can be used in the speech recognition system. The process of feature extraction of speech signal using MFCC will produce acoustic speech signal. The classification, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is used to match unidentified speaker’s voice with the voices in database. In this research, the system is used to verify the speaker, namely 15 text dependent in Indonesian. On testing the speaker with the same as database, the highest accuracy is 99,16%.",

        "abstract": "Bahasa Madura is a regional language used in Madura island. This language has many variations of pronunciation and dialect that makes it not easy to learn, even by the local people especially children. There hasn’t been any interesting learning media to learn Bahasa Madura so far. In fact, a fun learning activity is needed to help children to enhance their ability in pronouncing animals’ names, numbers, fruits and things in Bahasa Madura. Thus, it’s considered important to create Bahasa Madura e-learning by implementing the recognition of voice patterns in order to make it easier for the children to learn Bahasa Madura which has several variations of pronunciation only for one single object. This Bahasa Madura e-learning application for young learners is used to introduce Bahasa Madura vocabularies by recognizing the voice pattern recordings which have been processed through MFCC technique as the extracted voice features and HMM as the learning techniques. The implementation of MFCC and HMM as the learning tool to introduce the pronunciation of regional language vocabularies especially Bahasa Madura has never been done before. Therefore, this research is expected to help the young learners to be able to pronounce Bahasa Madura vocabularies properly.  In this study, a number of young learners’ voices were recorded and were set as the trial data. Only the proper voice data that were used—voice data that were considered to be pronounced correctly. The trial method was done through one-single model and multi-model. After doing several simultaneous trials, the result showed the accuracy level. The average accuracy level for one-single model system was 73% (with the highest accuracy reached 75%) and the average accuracy level for multi-model system was 80% (with the highest accuracy reached 81%).",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research presents an innovative approach called Tenacious Fish Swarm Optimization based Hidden Markov Model (TFSO-HMM) for augmented accurate cotton leaf disease identification and yield prediction. Cotton leaf diseases significantly threaten crop productivity, requiring timely detection and precise prediction for effective disease management. The proposed TFSO-HMM framework combines the strengths of Tenacious Fish Swarm Optimization (TFSO) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to address the challenges associated with disease identification and yield prediction in cotton plants. TFSO, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm, optimizes the classification process, enhancing the accuracy of disease identification. By harnessing the collective intelligence of fish swarms, TFSO intelligently explores the search space to identify the optimal solution. The selected information is then incorporated into the HMM framework, which captures the temporal dependencies in disease progression and yield prediction. HMM's sequential modelling approach facilitates understanding the dynamic behaviour of cotton leaf diseases over time, leading to more accurate predictions. Experimental results on a comprehensive dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the TFSO-HMM method over existing approaches in terms of accuracy and predictive capability. The augmented accuracy achieved through TFSO-HMM enables early detection and precise prediction of cotton leaf diseases, enabling timely interventions for disease management and maximizing crop yield.",

Therefore, detecting these attacks from network traffic has become a challenge in this an adversarial setting. In this paper, an enhanced Hidden Markov Model, called the Anti-Adversarial Hidden Markov Model (AA-HMM), is proposed to effectively detect evasion pattern, using the Dynamic Window and Threshold techniques to achieve adaptive, anti-adversarial, and online-learning abilities. In addition, a concept called Pattern Entropy is defined and acts as the foundation of AA-HMM. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach employing two well-known benchmark data sets, NSL-KDD and CTU-13, in terms of the common performance metrics and the algorithm’s adaptation and anti-adversary abilities.",

        "abstract": "\n        &lt;p&gt;Modeling seismicity data is challenging and it remains a subject of ongoing research. Assumptions about the distribution of earthquake numbers play an important role in seismic hazard and risk analysis. The most common distribution that has been widely used in modeling earthquake numbers is the Poisson distribution because of its simplicity and easy to use. However, the heterogeneity in earthquake data and temporal dependencies that are often present in many real earthquake sequences make the use of the Poisson distribution inadequate. So, we propose the use of a Hidden Markov model (HMM) with state-specific Negative Binomial distributions in which some states are allowed to approach the Poisson distribution. A HMM is a generalization of a mixture model where the different unobservable (hidden) states are related through a Markov process rather than being independent of each other. We parameterize the Negative Binomial distribution in terms of the mean and dispersion (clustering) parameter. Maximum likelihood estimates of the models&amp;#8217; parameters are obtained through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM-algorithm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We apply the model to real earthquake data. We have selected the area of Killini Western Greece to test the proposed hypothesis. The area of Killini has been selected based on the fact that in a time window of 17 years three clusters of seismicity associated with strong mainshocks are included in the catalog. Application of the model to the data resulted in three states, representing different levels of seismicity (low, medium, high). The state that corresponds to the low seismicity level approaches the Poisson distribution while the other two states (medium and high) are following the Negative Binomial distribution. This result complies with the nature of the data. The variation within each state that is introduced to the model by the Negative Binomial distribution is greater in the states of medium and high seismicity.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n        ",

Identifying differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) in cancer samples is a crucial step toward understanding these changes. In this paper, we propose a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) approach that uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) with binomial emission, and bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) data, calledDMCTHM, to identify DMCs in cancer epigenetic studies. We introduce the Expander-Collider penalty to tackle under and overestimation in TMCMC-HMMs. We address all known challenges inherent in BS-Seq data by introducing novel approaches for capturing functional patterns and autocorrelation structure of the data, as well as for handling missing values, multiple covariates, multiple comparisons, and family-wise errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofDMCTHMthrough comprehensive simulation studies. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other competing methods in identifying DMCs. Notably, withDMCTHM, we uncovered new DMCs and genes in Colorectal cancer that were significantly enriched in the Tp53 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are the most popular recognition algorithm for pattern recognition. Hidden Markov Models are mathematical representations of the stochastic process, which produces a series of observations based on previously stored data. The statistical approach in HMMs has many benefits, including a robust mathematical foundation, potent learning and decoding techniques, effective sequence handling abilities, and flexible topology for syntax and statistical phonology. The drawbacks stem from the poor model discrimination and irrational assumptions required to build the HMMs theory, specifically the independence of the subsequent feature frames (i.e., input vectors) and the first-order Markov process. The developed algorithms in the HMM-based statistical framework are robust and effective in real-time scenarios. Furthermore, Hidden Markov Models are frequently used in real-world applications to implement gesture recognition and comprehension systems. Every state of the model can only observe one symbol in the Markov chain. In contrast, every state in the topology of a Hidden Markov Model can see one symbol emerging from a particular gesture. The matrix representing the observation probability distribution contains the likelihood of observing a symbol in each state. As an illustration, the probability that a symbol will emit is determined by its observation probability in the first state. In the recognition task, the emission distribution is another name for the observation probability distribution. For the following reasons, HMM states are also referred to as hidden. First, choosing to emit a symbol denotes the second process. Second, an HMM’s emitter only releases the observed symbol. Finally, since the current states are derived from the previous states, the emitting states are unknown. HMMs are well-known and more flexible in the field of gesture recognition because of their stochastic nature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nPredicting the response of cancer cell lines to specific drugs is an essential problem in personalized medicine. Since drug response is closely associated with genomic information in cancer cells, some large panels of several hundred human cancer cell lines are organized with genomic and pharmacogenomic data. Although several methods have been developed to predict the drug response, there are many challenges in achieving accurate predictions. This study proposes a novel feature selection-based method, named Auto-HMM-LMF, to predict cell line-drug associations accurately. Because of the vast dimensions of the feature space for predicting the drug response, Auto-HMM-LMF focuses on the feature selection issue for exploiting a subset of inputs with a significant contribution.\n\nResults\nThis research introduces a novel method for feature selection of mutation data based on signature assignments and hidden Markov models. Also, we use the autoencoder models for feature selection of gene expression and copy number variation data. After selecting features, the logistic matrix factorization model is applied to predict drug response values. Besides, by comparing to one of the most powerful feature selection methods, the ensemble feature selection method (EFS), we showed that the performance of the predictive model based on selected features introduced in this paper is much better for drug response prediction. Two datasets, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are used to indicate the efficiency of the proposed method across unseen patient cell-line. Evaluation of the proposed model showed that Auto-HMM-LMF could improve the accuracy of the results of the state-of-the-art algorithms, and it can find useful features for the logistic matrix factorization method.\n\nConclusions\nWe depicted an application of Auto-HMM-LMF in exploring the new candidate drugs for head and neck cancer that showed the proposed method is useful in drug repositioning and personalized medicine. The source code of Auto-HMM-LMF method is available in https://github.com/emdadi/Auto-HMM-LMF.\n",

Simulation and applied data analyses were conducted to compare the proposed VB method to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The results revealed that the parameter estimates provided by the VB method are consistent with the MCMC method with the additional benefit of a faster estimation time. The comparative simulation also indicated differences between the two methods in terms of posterior standard deviation and coverage of 95% credible intervals. Thus, with limited computational resources and time, the proposed VB method can output comparable estimations with that of MCMC.",

This work mines the data from a cognitive study of configuration design to extract helpful design heuristics. The extraction of these heuristics is automated through the application of hidden Markov models. Results show that, for a truss configuration problem, designers proceed through four procedural states in solving configuration design problems, transitioning from topology design to shape and parameter design. High-performing designers are distinguished by their opportunistic tuning of parameters early in the process, enabling a heuristic search process similar to the A* search algorithm.",
