        "abstract": "Temporal difference learning (TD) is a foundational concept in reinforcement learning (RL), aimed at efficiently assessing a policy's value function. TD(λ), a potent variant, incorporates a memory trace to distribute the prediction error into the historical context. However, this approach often neglects the significance of historical states and the relative importance of propagating the TD error, influenced by challenges such as visitation imbalance or outcome noise. To address this, we propose a novel TD algorithm named discerning TD learning (DTD), which allows flexible emphasis functions—predetermined or adapted during training—to allocate efforts effectively across states. We establish the convergence properties of our method within a specific class of emphasis functions and showcase its promising potential for adaptation to deep RL contexts. Empirical results underscore that employing a judicious emphasis function not only improves value estimation but also expedites learning across diverse scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Traditional backward recursion methods face a fundamental challenge in solving Markov Decision Processes (MDP), where there exists a contradiction between the need for knowledge of optimal expected payoffs and the inability to acquire such knowledge during the decision-making process. To address this challenge and strike a reasonable balance between exploration and exploitation in the decision process, this paper proposes a novel model known as Temporal Error-based Adaptive Exploration (TEAE). Leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, TEAE overcomes the limitations of traditional MDP solving methods. TEAE exhibits dynamic adjustment of exploration probabilities based on the agent’s performance, on the one hand. On the other hand, TEAE approximates the optimal expected payoff function for subprocesses after specific states and times by integrating deep convolutional neural networks to minimize the temporal difference error between the dual networks. Furthermore, the paper extends TEAE to DQN-PER and DDQN-PER methods, resulting in DQN-PER-TEAE and DDQN-PER-TEAE variants, which not only demonstrate the generality and compatibility of the TEAE model with existing reinforcement learning techniques but also validate the practicality and applicability of the proposed approach in a broader MDP reinforcement learning context. To further validate the effectiveness of TEAE, the paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics, compares its performance with other MDP reinforcement learning methods, and conducts case studies. Ultimately, simulation results and case analyses consistently indicate that TEAE exhibits higher efficiency, highlighting its potential in driving advancements in the field.",

It is argued that relevance should not be considered as a particular relation, but as a (higher-order) property of instances of arbitrary relations: namely the property that variations of the relata of the relation instance make a difference for its truth. This generalized account of relevance can be fruitfully applied in many domains, such as (i) logical reasoning with applications to explanation, confirmation, verisimilitude, is-ought inference, (ii) probabilistic reasoning with applications to explanation and confirmation, (iii) nomological and causal implication, (iv) communication, (v) grounding and (vi) essentiality. In conclusion, difference-making relevance is a highly unifying and fruitful philosophical concept.",

        "abstract": "Based on the NDVI and climate data from 2000 to 2022, this study systematically investigated the spatial and temporal patterns, trend characteristics, and stability of the NDVI in Xinjiang using the one-way linear regression method, Theil–Sen Median trend analysis, the Mann–Kendall significance test, and the coefficient of variation. Meanwhile, the persistence of the NDVI distribution was analyzed by combining the trend results and Hurst index. Finally, partial correlation analysis was used to deeply explore the response mechanisms of interannual and seasonal-scale NDVI and climatic factors in Xinjiang, and the characteristics of multi-year vegetation distribution were comprehensively analyzed with the help of human footprint data. The findings indicate the following: (1) The NDVI of interannual and seasonal vegetation in Xinjiang showed a significant increasing trend during the 23-year period, but the spatial distribution was heterogeneous, and the improvement of the vegetation condition in the southern part of the region was remarkable. (2) The NDVI is relatively stable across the region. Unlike in other regions, in general, it is difficult to maintain the existing trend in NDVI in the study area for a long period of time, and the reverse trend is more persistent. (3) On the interannual scale, both precipitation and temperature are positively correlated with the NDVI, and the influence of temperature (80.94%) is greater than that of precipitation (63.82%). Precipitation was dominantly positively correlated with the NDVI in spring, summer, and the growing season, while it was negatively correlated with it in autumn. Temperature and NDVI were positively correlated, with the greatest influence in the spring. (4) Human activities had the greatest impact on the areas with low vegetation cover and areas with medium–low vegetation cover, and there was a high degree of overlap between the areas where the interannual human footprints and NDVI showed an increasing trend. The percentage of human footprints that significantly correlated with interannual NDVI was 34.79%. In the future, the protection and management of ecologically fragile areas should be increased to increase desert-vegetation cover.",

        "abstract": " Temporal difference learning (TD), coupled with neural networks, is among the most fundamental building blocks of deep reinforcement learning. However, because of the nonlinearity in value function approximation, such a coupling leads to nonconvexity and even divergence in optimization. As a result, the global convergence of neural TD remains unclear. In this paper, we prove for the first time that neural TD converges at a sublinear rate to the global optimum of the mean-squared projected Bellman error for policy evaluation. In particular, we show how such global convergence is enabled by the overparameterization of neural networks, which also plays a vital role in the empirical success of neural TD. We establish the theory for two-layer neural networks in the main paper and extend them to multilayer neural networks in the appendix. Beyond policy evaluation, we establish the global convergence of neural (soft) Q learning.  Funding: Z. Yang acknowledges the Theory of Reinforceement Learning program at Simons Institute. J. D.

A comprehensive introductory text focusing on financial applications of RL is rare if not difficult to find. This essay is aimed at presenting a short yet concise one-stop-resource that covers: (a) few important basics of RL, (b) types of problems it can address, (c) how it works, (d) its strength and limitations especially when compared to other approaches, (e) scopes within which the use of RL is recommended, and (f) examples of its applications in finance. Getting this writing to be comprehensive and effective in practice is a much more ambitious attempt, but it does highlight what it makes to work in practice.  sample/object of research, research instruments, and research results",

        "abstract": "AbstractPolicy evaluation (PE) is a critical sub‐problem in reinforcement learning, which estimates the value function for a given policy and can be used for policy improvement. However, there still exist some limitations in current PE methods, such as low sample efficiency and local convergence, especially on complex tasks. In this study, a novel PE algorithm called Least‐Squares Truncated Temporal‐Difference learning (LST2D) is proposed. In LST2D, an adaptive truncation mechanism is designed, which effectively takes advantage of the fast convergence property of Least‐Squares Temporal Difference learning and the asymptotic convergence property of Temporal Difference learning (TD). Then, two feature pre‐training methods are utilised to improve the approximation ability of LST2D. Furthermore, an Actor‐Critic algorithm based on LST2D and pre‐trained feature representations (ACLPF) is proposed, where LST2D is integrated into the critic network to improve learning‐prediction efficiency. Comprehensive simulation studies were conducted on four robotic tasks, and the corresponding results illustrate the effectiveness of LST2D. The proposed ACLPF algorithm outperformed DQN, ACER and PPO in terms of sample efficiency and stability, which demonstrated that LST2D can be applied to online learning control problems by incorporating it into the actor‐critic architecture.",

        "abstract": "In 2020, WHO included dengue as a global health threat among 10 other diseases. This is also a problem in Indonesia, especially the province of West Java. Based on data from the Ministry of Health for 2022, West Java is the largest contributor to cases of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in Indonesia. The spread of dengue fever is through mosquitoes, but climate also greatly influences the spread of this disease. The spread of West Java is quite wide, consisting of 27 city districts and a relatively high population density. This greatly influences the increase in the number of dengue fever cases. In this research, we will group years with the same dengue fever cases and identify groups of districts/cities in West Java with the same pattern of dengue fever cases for 2016 to 2021. The results obtained are that 2016 is the group with the highest number of cases. Meanwhile, from 27 city districts in West Java, three groups were obtained. Group 1 is the group with the highest number of cases consisting of Sukabumi City, Bandung City, Cimahi City, Depok City, Tasikmalaya City.",

The majority of people still do not know whether water is suitable for consumption or not. The quality of drinking water can be distinguished based on the mineral parameters contained in the water. This article will explain the classification of water sample data by applying a Machine Learning Algorithm, which includes modeling with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, K- Nearest Neighbor(KNN), XGBoost Classifier. Classification models produce varying degrees of accuracy. The highest accuracy is obtained in the Random Forest Classifier model with an accuracy rate of 78%. Analysis of drinking water quality with machine learning algorithms is very easy to understand, because the results of this study produce very simple results so that they are easy to understand",

        "abstract": "Oncogenetic graphical models are crucial for understanding cancer progression by analyzing the accumulation of genetic events. These models are used to identify statistical dependencies and temporal order of genetic events, which helps design targeted therapies. However, existing algorithms do not account for temporal differences between samples in oncogenetic analysis. This paper introduces Timed Hazard Networks (TimedHN), a new statistical model that uses temporal differences to improve accuracy and reliability. TimedHN models the accumulation process as a continuous-time Markov chain and includes an efficient gradient computation algorithm for optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that TimedHN outperforms current state-of-the-art graph reconstruction methods. We also compare TimedHN with existing methods on a luminal breast cancer dataset, highlighting its potential utility. The Matlab implementation and data are available at https://github.com/puar-playground/TimedHN",

The first part introduces a detailed information about different characteristics and learning types in terms of learning problems, hybrid learning problems, statistical inference and learning techniques; besides to an exhausted historical background about feature learning and DL. The second part is about the major architectures of DL with mathematical equations and clarified examples. These architectures include Autoencoders (AEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Recursive Neural Networks. The third part of this work represents an overview with detailed explanation about different applications and use-cases. Finally, the fourth part is about hardware/ software tools used with DL.\n\nIndex Terms— Deep learning, Machine Learning, Neural Network, Network architecture.",

Correspondingly, differential algebra of weight [Formula: see text] extends the well-established theories of differential algebra and difference algebra. In this paper, we initiate the study of differential operators with weights, in particular difference operators, on lattices. We show that differential operators of weight [Formula: see text] on a lattice coincide with differential operators, while differential operators are special cases of difference operators. Distributivity of a lattice is characterized by the existence of certain difference operators. Furthermore, we characterize and enumerate difference operators on finite chains and finite quasi-antichains. ",

        "abstract": "The temporal difference learning (TDL) algorithm has been essential to conceptualizing the role of dopamine in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its theoretical importance, it remains unknown whether a neuronal implementation of this algorithm exists in the brain. Here, we provide an interpretation of the recently described signaling properties of ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABAergic neurons and show that a circuitry of these neurons implements the TDL algorithm. Specifically, we identified the neuronal mechanism of three key components of the TDL model: a sustained state value signal encoded by an afferent input to the VTA, a temporal differentiation circuit formed by two types of VTA GABAergic neurons the combined output of which computes momentary reward prediction (RP) as the derivative of the state value, and the computation of reward prediction errors (RPEs) in dopamine neurons utilizing the output of the differentiation circuit. Using computational methods, we also show that this mechanism is optimally adapted to the biophysics of RPE signaling in dopamine neurons, mechanistically links the emergence of conditioned reinforcement to RP, and can naturally account for the temporal discounting of reinforcement. Elucidating the implementation of the TDL algorithm may further the investigation of RL in biological and artificial systems.",

People often spend a lot of time using it because of the push mechanism. The appearance of the push mechanism deeply affects peoples daily life whether in socializing or entertainment, but most people dont know how the push mechanism works. This paper uses the literature analysis method, case study and review to focus on the development of the push mechanism, principle and its applications. The purpose of this paper is to increase public awareness of the application of the push mechanism and its principle. It can be found that the push mechanism is effective and helpful for all people whether what the identity of the people is.",

Urban borderlands expand territorially beyond the mere linear border, drawing together what exists in or across both sides of the divide. In that they are not merely physical, but of course always socially, culturally, and experientially densely charged, the notion of the urban borderland offers itself as a useful analytic in the study of urban conditions that are marked by contiguity and coexistence. Contributions in this issue explore the potential of urban borderline studies across global cities, spanning various scales and employing theoretical frameworks such as borderlands, liminality, and multiple identities. This issue emphasizes the importance of considering bordering processes in urban planning and design and shows that urban borderlands are sites of contestation, negotiation, and coexistence, offering valuable lessons for the future of urban research and practice.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) methods offer advanced algorithms and tools to enhance drug development. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) approaches have successfully predicted several physicochemical aspects of pharmaceuticals, including toxicity, intake, drug-drug interactions, carcinogenesis, and dispersion.  ML, a branch of artificial intelligence, has demonstrated significant promise in drug development. The methods presented in this study can model non-linear databases and handle big data that is becoming more extensive and intricate. Diverse ML methodologies are currently employed for making forecasts of drug targets, modeling the framework of drug targets, forecasting binding sites, conducting ligand-based similarity searches, designing novel ligands with specific properties, creating scoring algorithms for molecular docking, constructing QSAR models for predicting biological reactions, and forecasting the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ligands. The findings of this study illustrate the widespread utilization of ML techniques in drug discovery, suggesting a favorable outlook for these advances. These findings have the potential to facilitate further exploration of ML in connection with drug discovery and growth by researchers, learners, and pharmaceutical companies.",
