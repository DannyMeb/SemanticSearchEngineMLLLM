        "abstract": "AbstractThe validation principles on Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship issued by Organization for Economic and Co‐operation and Development describe three criteria of model assessment: goodness of fit, robustness and prediction. In the case of robustness, two ways are possible as internal validation: bootstrap and cross‐validation. We compared these validation metrics by checking their sample size dependence, rank correlations to other metrics and uncertainty. We used modeling methods from multivariate linear regression to artificial neural network on 14 open access datasets. We found that the metrics provide similar sample size dependence and correlation to other validation parameters. The individual uncertainty originating from the calculation recipes of the metrics is much smaller for both ways than the part caused by the selection of the training set or the training/test split. We concluded that the metrics of the two techniques are interchangeable, but the interpretation of cross‐validation parameters is easier according to their similar range to goodness‐of‐fit and prediction metrics. Furthermore, the variance originating from the random elements of the calculation of cross‐validation metrics is slightly smaller than those of bootstrap ones, if equal calculation load is applied.",

        "abstract": " Cross-validation is the most common way of selecting tuning parameters in penalized regression, but its use in penalized Cox regression models has received relatively little attention in the literature. Due to its partial likelihood construction, carrying out cross-validation for Cox models is not straightforward, and there are several potential approaches for implementation. Here, we propose a new approach based on cross-validating the linear predictors of the Cox model and compare it to approaches that have been proposed elsewhere. We show that the proposed approach offers an attractive balance of performance and numerical stability, and illustrate these advantages using simulated data as well as analyzing a high-dimensional study of gene expression and survival in lung cancer patients.

This study aims to cross-culturally validate the OARS for assessing elderly Angolans.\n\n\nMethods\nThe cognitive and functional domains of the OARS were cross-culturally adapted, followed by psychometric analysis on a representative sample. Domains of activities of daily living and mental health were evaluated. Internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, resulting in 0.80 for activities of daily living and 0.80 for mental health, with a 95% confidence interval.\n\n\nResults\nThe psychometric analysis demonstrated consistent reliability in the domains of activities of daily living and mental health, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of 0.80 for both, supported by 95% confidence intervals. These results indicate substantial reliability.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe cross-cultural validation of the OARS is ongoing, and preliminary results from the psychometric analysis reinforce the reliability of the domains of activities of daily living and mental health. Adapting the OARS could be a valuable tool for assessing elderly Angolans, providing reliable and internationally comparable data.

        "abstract": " Psychology of Working Theory (PWT) is a relatively new vocational theory applicable to various cultural contexts around the world. However, proper examination of the theory within a Turkish context has been limited due to measurement concerns. Thus, in the present studies, we aimed to first translate the most frequently used PWT measures into Turkish by following best practices for scale translation and proceeded to then examine the full PWT model among Turkish working adults. We conducted two separate studies to address our primary aims. In Study 1, we translated the scales and conducted initial validity, and data was collected from 390 Turkish working adults to test the dimensionality and reliability of the scales. Results indicated that both the Economic Constraints Scale and Lifetime Experiences of Marginalization Scale were unidimensional models and the Work Needs Satisfaction Scale had a higher-order model consistent with the original development studies. In Study 2, using these newly translated scales, we examined the full PWT model among a new group of 564 Turkish working adults. Results showed that overall, PWT propositions were largely supported by the sample except for the role of work volition. Limitations and implications of the studies are discussed. ",

        "abstract": "Background: Various tools have been used to perform nutritional screening and assessment, and the Mini Nutritional Assessment [MNA] is one of the most widely used and recommended tools in the geriatric population. MNA is available in two lengths: long and short. MNA short-forms, on the other hand, have not been evaluated in Ethiopia. As a result, the purpose of this study was to validate MNA short form against serum albumin concentration in Ethiopian elders. Methods: The community based cross-sectional validation study included 176 elderly people who were recruited at random. Those who had limbs amputated, were bedridden, or had an obvious abnormality were not eligible, a known liver and/or kidney disorder. The original MNA questions were translated into Afan Oromo and Amharic. All translated and pretested MNA questionnaires were administered to each participant. Anthropometrics and albumin levels in the blood were determined. Positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive values [NPV] were calculated, as well as reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity. A receiver-operating characteristic curve [ROC-curve] study for MNA was used to calculate the area under the curve [AUC] and appropriate cut-off value for predicting malnutrition. Result: A strong association between serum albumin concentration score and MNA-short form score Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of BMI-MNA-SF 0.526, p 0.05 and CC-MNA-SF 0.501, p 0.05. At 95 percent CI, the agreement between the long and short forms of MNA was found to be a weighted kappa of 0.404[0.288, 0.521] for BMI-MNA-SF and 0.426[0.333, 0.519] for CC-MNA-SF. These results show a moderate agreement with serum albumin concentrations. The BMI-MNA-SF and the CC-MNA-SF have a high level of agreement 0.400. [0.322, 0.478]. Furthermore, high power to distinguish two categories using serum albumin concentration as the gold standard and AUC for BMI –MNA-SF 0.789 [0.722-0.855] and 0.791 [0.726-0.857] for CC-MNA-SF at 95% CI. Diagnostic accuracy for BMI-MNA-SF showed that 37.1% sensitivity, 90.8% specificity, 58.5% PPV, and 80.5% NPV. Similarly, sensitivity 77.5%, specificity of 64.4% PPV 73.7%, and 69.0%, NPV for CC-MNA-SF. Total Diagnostic accuracy for BMI-MNA-SF 63.64%, and 71.02% for CC-MNA-SF. Conclusion: Both types of MNA-SF have been shown to be effective screening tools as compared to serum albumin concentration levels in the elders in Meki town, East Ethiopia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAccident analysis and ensuring power plant safety are pivotal in the nuclear energy sector. Significant strides have been achieved over the past few decades regarding fire protection and safety, primarily centered on design and regulatory compliance. Yet, after the Fukushima accident a decade ago, the imperative to enhance measures against fire, internal flooding, and power loss has intensified. Hence, a comprehensive, multilayered protection strategy against severe accidents is needed. Consequently, gaining a deeper insight into pool fires and their behavior through extensive validated data can greatly aid in improving these measures using advanced validation techniques. A model validation study was performed at Sandia National Laboratories in which a 30-cm diameter methanol pool fire was modeled using the SIERRA/Fuego turbulent reacting flow code. This validation study used a standard validation experiment to compare model results against, and conclusions have been published. The fire was modeled with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model with subgrid turbulent kinetic energy closure. Combustion was modeled using a strained laminar flamelet library approach. Radiative heat transfer was accounted for with a model utilizing the gray-gas approximation. In the present study, additional validation analysis is performed using the area validation metric (AVM). These activities are done on multiple datasets involving different variables and temporal/spatial ranges and intervals. The results provide insight into the use of the area validation metric on such temporally varying datasets and the importance of physics-aware use of the metric for proper analysis.",

        "abstract": "Multi-label classification is a unique challenge in machine learning designed for two targets with each containing one or multiple classes. This problem can be resolved using several methods, including the classification of the targets individually or simultaneously. However, most models cannot classify the target simultaneously, and this is not expected to happen in the modeling rule. This study was conducted to propose a novel solution in the form of a Vector Generalized Additive Model Using Cross-Validation (VGAMCV) to address these problems. The proposed method leverages the Vector Generalized Additive Model (VGAM), which is a semi-parametric model combining both parametric and non-parametric components as the underlying base model. Cross-validation was also applied to tune the parameters to optimize the performance of the method. Moreover, the methodology of VGAMCV was compared with a tree-based model, Random Forest, commonly used in multi-label classification to evaluate its effectiveness based on fourteen metric scores. The results showed positive outcomes as indicated by 0.703 average accuracy and 0.601 Area Under Curve (AUC) recorded, but these improvements were not statistically significant. Meanwhile, the method offered a viable alternative for multi-label classification tasks, and its introduction served as a contribution to the expanding repertoire of methods available for this purpose.",

This study applies time series cross-validation to evaluate forecasting results up to seven steps ahead. As an illustration, we use Malaysia’s hourly electricity load data. Each hour is considered a series of each, so there are 24 daily series. Time series cross-validation with a 334 window was applied to 24 data series, and then each daily series was modeled with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR), ExponenTial Smoothing (ETS), Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) models. In terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) from one to seven steps ahead, we then evaluate the performance of all models. The experimental results show that the MAPEs obtained from the GRNN model tend to increase along with the theory. However, MAPEs obtained from ETS increase by up to three steps ahead and decrease after that. Among the five models, ARIMA, NNAR, and SSA produce a reasonably stable MAPE value for one to seven steps ahead. However, SSA has the most stable error value compared to ARIMA and NNAR.\r\nKeywords: time series, cross-validation, evaluate, forecasting model performance",

Its early detection allows for timely treatment and greater therapeutic efficacy. However, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is currently underdiagnosed. Although recent decades have seen a rise in computerized instruments for the detection and early diagnosis of MCI, showing numerous advantages over the classic paper-and-pencil methods, such as standardized stimulus presentation. However, their limitations include the use of self-administered application without professional supervision. Few of these instruments have Spanish-adapted versions.\n\n\nObjective\nTo translate, adapt, and validate the computerized Information Processing Assessment Battery (COGNITO) battery in the Spanish population and to develop a portable administration system that facilitates its application in different settings. COGNITO was then administered to 232 Spanish participants (18–89 years) without cognitive impairment, after which preliminary normative data were obtained.\n\n\nResults\nStrong positive correlations were found between the main cognitive domains assessed by COGNITO and the variables of age, educational level, and MEC score. The gender variable only correlated with visuospatial skills, with men outperforming women. The test–retest correlations conducted after 4 weeks with 89 participants revealed adequate reliability coefficients ranging between.63 and.66 (visuospatial skills = 0.35). Internal consistency coefficients were satisfactory in Attention-Executive Functions and Memory domains.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe Spanish adaptation of COGNITO shows adequate psychometric characteristics of validity and reliability. The preliminary normative data provided may contribute to the early detection of cognitive impairments associated with both normal aging and various types of neurological pathology. This tool has great utility and versatility for neuropsychological practice.\n",

Here, the triple collocation (TC) method is employed to evaluate multi-source precipitation datasets: gauge-based CGDPA, model-based ERA5, and satellite-derived IMERG-Early, IMERG-Late, GSMaP-NRT, and GSMaP-MVK over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). TC-based results show that ERA5 has better performances than satellite-only precipitation products over mountainous regions with complex terrains. For purely satellite-derived products, IMERG products outperform GSMaP products. Considering the potential existence of error dependency among input datasets, caution should be exercised. Thus, it is necessary to introduce an alternative cross-validation method (generalized Three-Cornered Hat) and explore the applicability of cross-validation from the perspective of error independence. We found that cross-validation methods have high applicability in most TP regions with sparse-gauge density (accounting for about 80.1% of the total area). Additionally, we conducted simulation experiments to discuss the applicability and robustness of TC. The simulation results substantiated that cross-validation can serve as a robust evaluation method over sparse-gauge regions. Although it is generally known that the cross-validation methods can be served in sparse-gauge regions, the application condition of different evaluation methods for precipitation products is identified quantitatively in TP now.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the solution to many practical problems relies on machine learning tools. However, compiling the appropriate training data set for real-world classification problems is challenging because collecting the right amount of data for each class is often difficult or even impossible. In such cases, we can easily face the problem of imbalanced learning. There are many methods in the literature for solving the imbalanced learning problem, so it has become a serious question how to compare the performance of the imbalanced learning methods. Inadequate validation techniques can provide misleading results (e.g., due to data shift), which leads to the development of methods designed for imbalanced data sets, such as stratified cross-validation (SCV) and distribution optimally balanced SCV (DOB-SCV). Previous studies have shown that higher classification performance scores (AUC) can be achieved on imbalanced data sets using DOB-SCV instead of SCV. We investigated the effect of the oversamplers on this difference. The study was conducted on 420 data sets, involving several sampling methods and the DTree, kNN, SVM, and MLP classifiers. We point out that DOB-SCV often provides a little higher F1 and AUC values for classification combined with sampling. However, the results also prove that the selection of the sampler–classifier pair is more important for the classification performance than the choice between the DOB-SCV and the SCV techniques.",

In this study, we developed green HPLC and spectrophotometric methods to determine the concentration of lenalidomide in pure and pharmaceutical formulations. In the HPLC method, 10 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate solution (pH: 2.0) and ethanol (50:50, V/V) were used as mobile phases, isocratic elution was applied at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 and detection was made at 304 nm. In the spectrophotometric method, the spectral patterns of standard solutions in different solvents were comprehensively examined, the best spectra were obtained with ultrapure water, and a wavelength of 304 nm was selected for detection. Both methods have been validated according to ICH guidelines for various parameters. Correlation coefficients greater than 0.999 were determined for both methods in the concentration range of 5–30 μg mL−1. The developed methods were applied to commercial formulations, and comparisons of the results were made using the Student (t) test for means and the Fischer (F) test for standard deviations. No statistically significant difference was observed between the methods. The greenness evaluation of these methods was carried out using AGREE software. The developed methods are proposed as excellent environmental and operator-friendly alternatives for the quantification of Lenalidomide in pharmaceutical formulations.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nTattooing, whose popularity is growing worldwide, is an invasive body art that involves the injection of chemical mixtures, the tattoo ink, into the upper layer of the dermis. Although these inks may contain environmental toxins, including known human carcinogens, their long-term health effects are poorly studied. To conduct the urgently required epidemiological studies on tattoos and their long-term health effects, a validated method for assessing the complex tattoo exposure is needed.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aimed to develop and validate the Epidemiological Tattoo Assessment Tool (EpiTAT), a questionnaire to self-assess tattoo ink exposure in tattooed populations suitable for application in large epidemiological cohort studies.\n\n\nMethods\nOne of 3 preliminary versions of the EpiTAT using one of the alternative tattoo measurement units hand surface, credit card, or body schemes was randomly filled in by tattooed volunteers in Lyon, France. To identify the most suitable unit of tattoo self-assessment, a validation study was conducted with the selected respondents (N=97) to compare the self-assessments of tattoo surface, color, and coverage with validation measurements made by trained study personnel. Intraclass correlation, the Kendall rank correlation, and 2-tailed t tests were used to statistically compare tattoo size, color area, and tattoo coverage separately for each questionnaire version. Participants’ opinions on the alternative measurement units were also considered in the overall evaluation. For quality control of the validation measures, digital surface analysis of 62 photographs of selected tattoos was performed using Fiji/ImageJ.\n\n\nResults\nIn general, the results revealed overestimation of self-assessed measures compared with validation measures (eg, mean tattooed body surface 1768, SD 1547, cm2 vs 930, SD 1047, cm2, respectively, for hand surface; P<.001) and validation measures compared with digital image analysis (mean individual tattoo surface 147, SD 303.9, cm2 vs 101, SD 154.7, cm2, respectively; P=.05). Although the measurement unit credit card yielded the most accurate measures for all variables of interest, it had a much lower completion rate (78/129, 60.5%) than hand surface (89/104, 85.6%) and body schemes (90/106, 84.9%). Hand surface measured total tattoo size more accurately than body schemes (absolute agreement intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.71 vs 0.64, respectively).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe final version of the EpiTAT contains 21 items and uses hand surface as a visual unit of measurement. Likert scales are used to assess color and coverage as a proportion of the total tattoo area. The overestimation of tattoo size by self-reporting merits further research to identify potential influential factors or predictive patterns that could be considered when calculating exposure.\n",

However, current assessment methods are primarily designed to assess the risk profile of individual banks. To enable cross-bank operational risk assessment, we propose an integrated AHP-DEA (analytic hierarchy process–data envelopment analysis) method. This method determines the importance of assessment criteria by calculating the weighted sum of rank votes after obtaining the importance values for specific rankings with DEA. This procedure replaces the pairwise comparisons in AHP and addresses the challenge of traditional AHPs in determining appropriate importance values when dealing with a large number of indicators. We applied this method to assess the operational risks of three Chinese commercial banks, and the empirical results indicate that this integrated AHP-DEA method is simple and user-friendly, making it suitable for cross-bank operational risk assessment.",

Users of this service can perform their triage by using the questions in the symptom checker. By completing the symptom checker, the user receives a recommendation for action and a service assessment with appropriate guidance regarding their health problems on the basis of a selected specific symptom in the symptom checker. This allows users to be provided with appropriate health care services, regardless of time and place.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study describes the protocol for the mixed methods validation process of the symptom checker available in Omaolo digital services.\n\n\nMethods\nThis is a mixed methods study using quantitative and qualitative methods, which will be part of the clinical validation process that takes place in primary health care centers in Finland. Each organization provides a space where the study and the nurse triage can be done in order to include an unscreened target population of users. The primary health care units provide walk-in model services, where no prior phone call or contact is required. For the validation of the Omaolo symptom checker, case vignettes will be incorporated to supplement the triage accuracy of rare and acute cases that cannot be tested extensively in real-life settings. Vignettes are produced from a variety of clinical sources, and they test the symptom checker in different triage levels by using 1 standardized patient case example.\n\n\nResults\nThis study plan underwent an ethics review by the regional permission, which was requested from each organization participating in the research, and an ethics committee statement was requested and granted from Pirkanmaa hospital district’s ethics committee, which is in accordance with the University of Tampere’s regulations. Of 964 clinical user–filled symptom checker assessments, 877 cases were fully completed with a triage result, and therefore, they met the requirements for clinical validation studies. The goal for sufficient data has been reached for most of the chief symptoms. Data collection was completed in September 2019, and the first feasibility and patient experience results were published by the end of 2020. Case vignettes have been identified and are to be completed before further testing the symptom checker. The analysis and reporting are estimated to be finalized in 2024.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe primary goals of this multimethod electronic symptom checker study are to assess safety and to provide crucial information regarding the accuracy and usability of the Omaolo electronic symptom checker. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to include real-life clinical cases along with case vignettes.\n\n\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\nDERR1-10.2196/41423\n",

For this purpose, we developed and validated a management competency model that would enable Spanish PA to enhance organizational achievements and prevent corrupt practices. Relations between managers’ competencies and their performance would be perceived as a fairer assessment of human resources processes and ultimately lead to the promotion of ethical behavior within the organization. We followed a mixed-method approach. Study 1 began with a content analysis of articles referring to managerial competencies, followed by Focus Groups and a Delphi panel procedure with subject matter experts, which resulted in a model of eight competencies. Based on this model, in Study 2, we developed a reliable and invariant-across-gender questionnaire (Public Manager Competencies Questionnaire – PUMACQ), which was validated with composite performance criteria (task, contextual, and unethical pro-organizational behavior), by means of a cross-sectional design survey on public managers from around Spain ( N = 439), using structural equation analyses. Our main results show significant relationships between job performance and the competencies of leadership, communication, engagement with PA, innovation orientation, and ethics. Finally, we discuss the practical applications of the results in the public context. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nModel validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the true value in the real world. The results of a model validation study can be used to either quantify the model form uncertainty or to improve/calibrate the model. The model validation process becomes complex when there is uncertainty in the simulation and/or experimental outcomes. These uncertainties can be in the form of aleatory uncertainties due to randomness or epistemic uncertainties due to lack of knowledge. Five different approaches are used for addressing model validation and predictive capability: (1) the area validation metric (AVM), (2) a modified area validation metric (MAVM) with confidence intervals, (3) the validation uncertainty procedure from ASME V&V 20, (4) a calibration procedure interpreted from ASME V&V 20, and (5) identification of the model discrepancy term using Bayesian estimation. To provide an unambiguous assessment of these different approaches, synthetic experimental data is generated from computational fluid dynamics simulations of an airfoil with a flap. A simplified model is then developed using thin airfoil theory. The accuracy of the simplified model is assessed using the synthetic experimental data. The quantities examined include the two-dimensional lift and moment coefficients for the airfoil with varying angles of attack and flap deflection angles. Each of these approaches is assessed for the ability to tightly encapsulate the true value at conditions both where experimental results are provided and prediction locations where no experimental data are available. Generally, it was seen that the MAVM performed the best in cases where there is a sparse amount of data and/or large extrapolations. Furthermore, it was found that Bayesian estimation outperformed the others where there is an extensive amount of experimental data that covers the application domain.",

The new model, with seven factors that are critical to the success of MC projects, was developed from a literature review. The model was then verified by developing a questionnaire that was sent to 15 experts and using Dempster–Shafer theory to obtain the weight of each part of the model. The model was applied to 13 real cases to verify its effectiveness in evaluating an MC project. This new MC model can help consulting teams to conduct assessments in the early and middle stages, and evaluate in the late stage, of consulting projects, and also can help teams improve the probability of project success and client satisfaction.

In order to solve the problem of imbalanced data types in cross-validation subsets, SCV is used to ensure that the data distribution in all subsets is consistent, thus avoiding model over-fitting. The traditional fitness function cannot solve the problem of small sample classification well. By designing a weighted fitness function and giving high weight to small sample data, the performance of the model can be effectively improved in the environment of imbalanced type distribution. The experimental results show that this model is superior to other intrusion detection models in recall and McNemar hypothesis test. In addition, the recall of the model for small sample data is higher, reaching 91.5% and 95.1%, respectively. This shows that it can effectively detect intrusions in an environment with imbalanced type distribution. Therefore, the model has practical application value in the field of intrusion detection, and can be used to improve the performance of intrusion detection systems in the actual environment. This method has a wide application prospect, such as network security, industrial control system, and power system.",

        "abstract": "Background: the study aimed to apply and validate the modified Gail Model (GM) in a group of Jordanian women to identify their estimated 5-years and lifelong breast cancer risk.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Jordan, wherein data were gathered from women who had no previous personal history of breast cancer during the period from January 2020 to June 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics and other breast cancer-related factors were gathered from the participants. Breast cancer risks were determined using the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) of the National Cancer Institute Online version (Gail Model version 2). Data were analyzed using the SPSS\nResults: A total of 502 women were involved in our study. The mean age was 47±8.8 years (range: 35-83). The majority of the women were married (93.6%). Twenty-seven women (5.2%) were nulliparous. Regarding menarche age, 243 women (47.3%) had their first cycle at the age of 12-13 years. One hundred women (19.9%) reported at least one family member with a breast cancer diagnosis while 23 women (4.6%) had a member with an ovarian cancer diagnosis. The calculated median for the 5-year BC risk was 0.8 (0.5 to 1.2), while the median for the lifetime risk was 9.2 (7.8 to 11.1). Thirty-eight women (7.6%) and 12 (2.4%) were categorized as having a high risk of developing BC in five years and a lifetime, respectively.\nConclusion: The utilization of Gail models can help healthcare providers identify a subset of women who are at an increased risk for breast cancer and personalize their approach in selecting the timing schedule and modality for breast cancer screening.",

        "abstract": "The use of classifiers provides an alternative to conventional statistical methods. This involves using the accuracy with which data is correctly assigned to a given group by the classifier to apply tests to compare the performance of classifiers. The conventional validation methods for determining the accuracy of classifiers have the disadvantage that the distribution of correct classifications does not follow any known distribution, and therefore, the application of statistical tests is problematic. Independent validation circumvents this problem and allows the use of binomial tests to assess the performance of classifiers. However, independent validation accuracy is subject to bias for small training datasets. The present study shows that a hyperbolic function can be used to estimate the loss in classifier accuracy for independent validation. This function is used to develop three new methods to estimate the classifier accuracy for small training sets more precisely. These methods are compared to two existing methods in a simulation study. The results indicate overall small errors in the estimation of classifier accuracy and indicate that independent validation can be used with small samples. A least square estimation approach seems best suited to estimate the classifier accuracy.",

The analysis puts forth a good and fit model, and the new scale reports sufficient convergent and discriminant validity.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is focused on the agripreneurial competencies of individual agripreneurs; institutional agripreneurs are excluded from the study.Social implicationsIdentifying prominent agripreneurs using the scale developed from this study will aid in allocating various government and non-governmental organisations' assistance to agripreneurs. Since developing economies rely heavily on agriculture, any positive contribution can help alleviate poor economic growth, end hunger, and promote sustainable agriculture (SDG 2 of 2030).Originality/valueThough several scales for measuring entrepreneurial competencies are available, there is no standard scale to measure agripreneurial competencies.

        "abstract": "We report the validity of a test instrument that assesses the arithmetic ability of primary students by (a) describing the theoretical model of arithmetic ability assessment using Wilson’s (2004) four building blocks of constructing measures and (b) providing empirical evidence for the validation study. The instrument consists of 21 multiple-choice questions that hierarchically evaluate arithmetic intended learning outcomes (ILOs) on arithmetic ability, hierarchically, based on Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy for 138 primary three grade students. The theoretical model describes students’ arithmetic ability on three distinct levels: solid, developing, and basic. At each level, the model describes the characteristics of the tasks that the students can answer correctly. The analysis shows that the difficulty of the items followed the expected order in the theoretical construct map, where the difficulty of each designed item aligned with the cognitive level of the student, the item difficulty distribution aligned with the structure of the person construct map, and word problems required higher cognitive abilities than the calculation problems did. The findings, however, pointed out that more difficult items can be added to better differentiate students with different ability levels, and an item should be revised to enhance the reliability and validity of the research. We conclude that the conceptualizations of such formative assessments provide meaningful information for teachers to support learning and tailoring instruction.",

        "abstract": "The dust level is included in the animal welfare legislation of the European Union, implying assessment of dust levels during veterinary welfare inspections. This study aimed to develop a valid and feasible method for measuring dust levels in poultry barns. Dust levels were assessed in 11 layer barns using six methods: light scattering measurement, the dust sheet test with durations of 1 h and 2–3 h, respectively, visibility assessment, deposition assessment, and a tape test. As a reference, gravimetric measurements were obtained – a method known to be accurate but unsuitable for veterinary inspection. The dust sheet test 2–3 h showed the highest correlation with the reference method with the data points scattered closely around the regression line and the slope being highly significant (p = 0.00003). In addition, the dust sheet test 2–3 h had the highest adjusted R2 (0.9192) and the lowest RMSE (0.3553), indicating a high capability of predicting the true concentration value of dust in layer barns. Thus, the dust sheet test with a test duration of 2–3 h is a valid method for assessing dust levels. A major challenge is the test duration as 2–3 h is longer than most veterinary inspections. Nevertheless, results showed that potentially, with some modifications to the scoring scale, the dust sheet test may be reduced to 1 h without losing validity.",

Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the four-factor model of the LSSAA fit the data for all four countries. Testing of the measurement invariance of the four-factor model among the four countries supported the adoption of a weak invariance model, and the LSSAA scores were comparable across all four countries.

        "abstract": "The assessment of road traffic noise is very important for the health of people living in urban areas. Noise is usually assessed by field measurements, and predictive models play an important role when experimental data are not available. Nevertheless, when they are based on regression techniques, predictive models suffer from the drawback of strong dependence on the calibration data. In this paper, the authors present a regressive model calibrated on computed noise levels without the need for field measurements. The independence from field measurements makes the model flexible and adjustable for any road traffic condition possible. A multilinear regression technique is applied to establish the correlation between the computed equivalent noise levels and several independent variables, including, among others, traffic flow and distance. The model is then validated on a large field measurement database to check its efficiency in terms of prediction accuracy. The validation is performed both via error distribution analysis and using different error metrics. The results are encouraging, showing that the model provides good results in terms of the average error (less than 2 dBA) and is not susceptible to the presence of outliers in the input data that correspond to unconventional conditions of the traffic flow.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA quantitative microbiological risk assessment model for the cross‐contamination transmission route in the kitchen (KCC) is presented. Bacteria are transmitted from contaminated (chicken) meat to hands, kitchen utensils, and other surfaces, subsequently contaminating a salad. The model aims to estimate the fraction of bacteria on the meat that is ingested due to cross‐contamination, determine the importance of the different transmission routes, and assess the effect of scenarios (interventions) on the fraction ingested. The cross‐contamination routes defined, bacterial source‐to‐recipient transfer fractions as available and derived from literature, and important characteristics (e.g., washing in cold water vs. hot water with soap) shaped the KCC model. With this model, 32 scenarios of an eight‐step preparation of a “meat and salad” meal in a domestic kitchen were stochastically simulated. The “cutting board‐salad” route proved dominant and the salad plays a major role in the final exposure. A realistic scenario (washing hands, cutting board, and knife with cold water after cutting the meat) estimates that a mean fraction of 3.2E − 3 of the bacteria on the meat is ingested. In the case of “hand washing with hot water and soap” and “cutting board and knife replacement,” the mean fraction ingested is 3.6E − 6. For a subsequent meal, where the contaminated sources were kitchen fomites, the estimated mean fraction is 4.3E − 4. In case of hamburger, part of the bacteria is unavailable for cross‐contamination, resulting in a mean fraction ingested of about 5.4E − 5. The role of the dishcloth in cross‐contamination transmission proved to be minor.",

        "abstract": "AbstractVector autoregressive (VAR) modelling is widely employed in psychology for time series analyses of dynamic processes. However, the typically short time series in psychological studies can lead to overfitting of VAR models, impairing their predictive ability on unseen samples. Cross‐validation (CV) methods are commonly recommended for assessing the predictive ability of statistical models. However, it is unclear how the performance of CV is affected by characteristics of time series data and the fitted models. In this simulation study, we examine the ability of two CV methods, namely,10‐fold CV and blocked CV, in estimating the prediction errors of three time series models with increasing complexity (person‐mean, AR, and VAR), and evaluate how their performance is affected by data characteristics. We then compare these CV methods to the traditional methods using the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) information criteria in their accuracy of selecting the most predictive models. We find that CV methods tend to underestimate prediction errors of simpler models, but overestimate prediction errors of VAR models, particularly when the number of observations is small. Nonetheless, CV methods, especially blocked CV, generally outperform the AIC and BIC. We conclude our study with a discussion on the implications of the findings and provide helpful guidelines for practice.",

The active community expresses opinions on social media, especially regarding the 2024 Presidential Election (Pilpres) and respective presidential candidates, which have become trending topics on Twitter. The analysis used to absorb these tweets into information is sentimen analysis using the Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm with the K-fold Cross-Validation method. Through the stages of pre-processing, weighting, labeling, classification using NBC, and testing using a Confusion Matrix, The results of the classification from NBC showed that Anies got 80% positive tweets and 20% negative tweets from 1186 tweets, Prabowo Subianto got 78% positive tweets and 22% negative tweets from 1149 tweets, and Ganjar Pranowo got 77% positive tweets and 23% negative tweets from 1075 tweets. Testing process was carried out using the NBC algorithm with the K-Fold Cross Validation method using values k=1 to k=10. The function of K-Fold Cross Validation is to maximize the confusion matrix result. It can be conclude that Anies Baswedan has the highest score in iteration 4, namely a precision value of 90%, a recall value of 99%, and the accurary value of 91%. Furthemore, Ganjar Pranowo had the highest score in iteration 9, namely a precision value of 95%,a recall value of  97%, and an accuracy value of 92%.

        "abstract": " The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is a widely used technique for examining reciprocal causal effects using longitudinal data. Critics of the CLPM have noted that by failing to account for certain person-level associations, estimates of these causal effects can be biased. Because of this, models that incorporate stable-trait components (e.g., the random-intercept CLPM) have become popular alternatives. Debates about the merits of the CLPM have continued, however, with some researchers arguing that the CLPM is more appropriate than modern alternatives for examining common psychological questions. In this article, I discuss the ways that these defenses of the CLPM fail to acknowledge well-known limitations of the model. I propose some possible sources of confusion regarding these models and provide alternative ways of thinking about the problems with the CLPM. I then show in simulated data that with realistic assumptions, the CLPM is very likely to find spurious cross-lagged effects when they do not exist and can sometimes underestimate these effects when they do exist.

This study was conducted on 320 Turkish mathematics teachers. The data were analysed using the SPSS 17.0 and LISREL 8.8 statistical software packages. EFA and CFA, item-total correlations, and convergent and discriminant validities were used to assess the construct validity. EFA and item analysis were performed with 170 mathematics teachers. After EFA, a four-factor scale with 25 items was identified, explaining 52.38% of the variance. The CFA was carried out with 150 mathematics teachers. The first and second-order CFA results indicated that the scale model had good fit indices, and the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale was confirmed. The Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability (CR) coefficients were satisfactory. The results of this study showed that the scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the frequency of mathematics teachers’ use of classroom assessment tools and methods.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSpecifying, assessing, and selecting among candidate statistical models is fundamental to ecological research. Commonly used approaches to model selection are based on predictive scores and include information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, and cross validation. Based on data splitting, cross validation is particularly versatile because it can be used even when it is not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., many forms of machine learning) or count parameters precisely (e.g., mixed‐effects models). However, much of the literature on cross validation is technical and spread across statistical journals, making it difficult for ecological analysts to assess and choose among the wide range of options. Here we provide a comprehensive, accessible review that explains important—but often overlooked—technical aspects of cross validation for model selection, such as: bias correction, estimation uncertainty, choice of scores, and selection rules to mitigate overfitting. We synthesize the relevant statistical advances to make recommendations for the choice of cross‐validation technique and we present two ecological case studies to illustrate their application. In most instances, we recommend using exact or approximate leave‐one‐out cross validation to minimize bias, or otherwise k‐fold with bias correction if k < 10. To mitigate overfitting when using cross validation, we recommend calibrated selection via our recently introduced modified one‐standard‐error rule. We advocate for the use of predictive scores in model selection across a range of typical modeling goals, such as exploration, hypothesis testing, and prediction, provided that models are specified in accordance with the stated goal. We also emphasize, as others have done, that inference on parameter estimates is biased if preceded by model selection and instead requires a carefully specified single model or further technical adjustments.",

In this paper, five primary indicators and 13 secondary indicators are selected, and the indicator weights are determined by EMW and AHP. The light pollution risk levels of different regions are calculated by the Topsis method. The output results show that the LPRL is highest in urban areas, followed by suburban and rural areas, and the LPRL in protected land is lowest, and the model results are consistent with the actual situation. Finally, this paper analyzes the weights of different indicators in the LRPL model, and proposes corresponding intervention policies for the three factors with the highest weights.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe development of robust and reliable kinetic models is vital to build safe, eco‐friendly, and cost‐competitive chemical processes. Establishing kinetic models for complex chemical systems such as biomass valorization is cumbersome because the kinetic modeller must test different models and fit several experimental observables (or concentrations). Usually, in chemical reaction engineering, kinetic model assessment is based solely on the regression stage outputs. The implementation of a validation stage can aid in choosing the most reliable kinetic models, essentially in the case of complex chemical systems. We studied the solvolysis of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (5‐HMF) to butyl levulinate (BL) as a model reaction constituting several consecutive and parallel reaction steps. From an existing kinetic model, we created 60 synthetic runs in batch conditions. In the first part, we tested four different models with 5 degrees of noise, and we carried out the modelling on the 60 synthetic runs. In the second part, two types of holdout methods were evaluated. In the last part, cross‐validation, namely the k‐fold method, was used. We found that the 10‐fold method allowed more efficient selection results even when the noise level was high. Besides, k‐fold allows for not scarifying experimental runs and selecting the most reliable model.",

An initial pool of 40 items, generated based on literature review, qualitative studies, and previously developed scales, was evaluated by the experts’ judgment, so 30 items were retained and then administered to an Iranian sample of 433 youth and adult participants aged 20 to 85 years. Participants also completed other measures relevant for construct validity: Existential Loneliness Questionnaire (ELQ), De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS-6), Existential Anxiety Questionnaire (EAQ), Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Exploratory factor analysis and parallel analysis showed strong evidence of unidimensionality. This result was also supported by confirmatory factor analysis test. Finally, 19 items were kept, which were free from DIF by gender and by marital status. The scale had high internal consistency (α = .95 and ω = .95) and adequate test–retest reliability with a 1-month interval ( r = .74). Examination of the ELS’ correlation with criterion measures indicated that the scale has good concurrent, discriminant, and convergent validity. Findings revealed the ELS as a reliable, valid, and suitable instrument to measure existential loneliness in the Iranian adult population. ",

The objective of this study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate the BACS in to the Serbian language. The study was conducted at the Laza Lazarevic Clinic for Mental Disorders and the Clinic for Psychiatry of the University Clinical Center of Serbia from March 2021 to January 2022. The study enrolled 61 inpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 61 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Compared with the healthy control group, the schizophrenia patient group had worse cognitive function in all dimensions measured using BACS (p < 0.001 for all measures). The mean standardized composite BACS score was z = −2.46, and symbol coding (z = −2.54) was the most deficient function. Principal component analysis suggests a two-factor structure, where the first factor consisted of loading the measures of verbal and working memory, attention, speed of information processing, and executive function, while the second factor regarded the loading of motor speed. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient demonstrated an excellent level of internal consistency (0.798). These outcomes suggest that the Serbian BACS neurocognitive battery’s psychometric properties are satisfactory, with good overall discriminant validity and high internal consistency. The Serbian BACS appears to be a quick and reliable neuropsychological instrument for evaluating global cognition in schizophrenia patients in Serbia.",

After that 2 back translations (BT1 and BT2) were done by 2 more translators based on the synthesized version (T12). By reviewing all these forward and backward translations, an expert committee made the pre-final version after making some linguistic modification. Then data collection was done among 100 subjects who were selected purposively. Reliability was assessed by Cronbach alpha. Content validity, face validity and Construct validity by factor analysis were measured. Internal consistency measured by Cronbach alpha found was 0.846. No significant change in Cronbach alpha was observed following deleting any item. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a good fit to data by a chi-square/df value1.33, RMSEA value 0.058. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value (.840) showed sampling adequacy. Exploratory factor analysis of the principal component identified 2 factors which had eigenvalues of more than 1. Scree plot also revealed similar factors. These 2 factors together explained 53.1% of the variance. All items were loaded under 2 factors after varimax rotation. The validated Bangla version of the BARC-10 demonstrated high internal reliability and validity. It can potentially be applied in “recovery-oriented” deaddiction service.",

        "abstract": "Background. This study focused on the cross-country validation of the Dutch perceptual-motor skills assessment used for talent detection in table tennis which also could be the basis to create country-specific norm values in young children (aged 7 to 9).\nMaterials and methods. In total, data from 172 children from Kosovo and 219 children from the Netherlands were compared. The data consisted of the outcomes of seven items of the Dutch perceptual-motor skills assessment evaluating gross motor function (i.e., sprint and vertical jump) and ball control (i.e., throwing a ball, speed while dribbling, aiming at target, ball skills and eye-hand coordination). A multivariate GLM analysis revealed significant differences between the two countries with large effect sizes regarding both constructs. Preliminary normative values are presented per country.\nResults. The results show that perceptual-motor skills can vary between children of the same age and sex between European countries. For that reason, it seems sensible to further investigate the necessity of establishing norm values per country and also the underlying mechanisms that might reveal why and how cross-country differences arise.\nConclusions. Moreover, it might make sense to study an international sample of recreational and high performance youth and adult players to create a benchmark for talent detection and talent identification in table tennis. This will likely gain more insight into what the key aspects are to participate in table tennis and what is necessary for the elite level.",

        "abstract": " Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is one of the most important mass timber materials that are commonly used in mid-rise or even high-rise timber buildings. However, exposure to moisture during construction may increase the moisture damage risks, and impact the durability performance of CLT buildings. To investigate potential solutions for avoiding wetting of CLT components during construction, CLT specimens having different moisture protection measures were tested in the damp and mild wintertime climate in Vancouver. This follow-up work focuses on two-dimensional (2-D) hygrothermal modeling of the wetting and drying behavior of bare CLT (without any protection) and the validation with measurements from the field exposure test, emphasizing the influence of material properties. The hygrothermal models are firstly calibrated for two CLT specimens positioned horizontally, with and without a butt joint, by using material properties from different laboratory tests, and assuming different rain penetration paths. The calibrated models are then applied to simulate CLT specimens positioned vertically, which have end grain directly exposed to rain or damp concrete in the test. The work reveals that the moisture storage function above RH 95%, which includes the saturation water content reported in different literature, has a significant influence on the hygrothermal simulation results; meanwhile, assigning different water absorption coefficients for the transverse and longitudinal directions of wood significantly improves the accuracy of the hygrothermal model created for simulating rainwater penetration into the CLT panel. This paper provides a recommendation on how to properly model the CLT panels exposed to rainwater, which often occurs during construction. ",

        "abstract": "The jar test is the current standard method for predicting the performance of a conventional drinking water treatment (DWT) process and optimizing the coagulant dose. This test is time-consuming and requires human intervention, meaning it is infeasible for making continuous process predictions. As a potential alternative, we developed a machine learning (ML) model from historical DWT plant data that can operate continuously using real-time sensor data without human intervention for predicting clarified water turbidity 15 min in advance. We evaluated three types of models: multilayer perceptron (MLP), the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN. We also employed two training methodologies: the commonly used holdout method and the theoretically correct blocked cross-validation (BCV) method. We found that the RNN with GRU was the best model type overall and achieved a mean absolute error on an independent production set of as low as 0.044 NTU. We further found that models trained using BCV typically achieve errors equal to or lower than their counterparts trained using holdout. These results suggest that RNNs trained using BCV are superior for the development of ML models for DWT processes compared to those reported in earlier literature.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe constant development of new data analysis methods in many fields of research is accompanied by an increasing awareness that these new methods often perform better in their introductory paper than in subsequent comparison studies conducted by other researchers. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by conducting a systematic experiment that we call “cross‐design validation of methods”. In the experiment, we select two methods designed for the same data analysis task, reproduce the results shown in each paper, and then reevaluate each method based on the study design (i.e., datasets, competing methods, and evaluation criteria) that was used to show the abilities of the other method. We conduct the experiment for two data analysis tasks, namely cancer subtyping using multiomic data and differential gene expression analysis. Three of the four methods included in the experiment indeed perform worse when they are evaluated on the new study design, which is mainly caused by the different datasets. Apart from illustrating the many degrees of freedom existing in the assessment of a method and their effect on its performance, our experiment suggests that the performance discrepancies between original and subsequent papers may not only be caused by the nonneutrality of the authors proposing the new method but also by differences regarding the level of expertise and field of application. Authors of new methods should thus focus not only on a transparent and extensive evaluation but also on comprehensive method documentation that enables the correct use of their methods in subsequent studies.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are extensively used with outstanding prediction accuracy. However, in some cases, their overfitting capabilities, along with inadvertent biases, might produce overly optimistic results. Spatial data are a special kind of data that could introduce biases to ML due to their intrinsic spatial autocorrelation. To address this issue, a special resampling method has emerged called spatial cross-validation (SCV). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of SCV compared with conventional random cross-validation (CCV) used in most ML studies. Multiple ML models were created with CCV and SCV to predict groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) with data (A) from Rhodope, Greece, in the summer of 2020; (B) from the same area but at a different time (summer 2019); and (C) from a new area (the Salento peninsula, Italy). The results showed that the SCV provides ML models with superior generalization capabilities and, hence, better prediction results in new unknown data. The SCV seems to be able to capture the spatial patterns in the data while also reducing the over-optimism bias that is often associated with CCV methods. Based on the results, SCV could be applied with ML in studies that use spatial data.",

        "abstract": "Information and communications technology (ICT) has bridged the gap between students and universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 brings pandemic pedagogy to transnational higher education (TNHE), the emergent response of Chinese universities to this disruption to education has been to update practices to tackle the pedagogical and contextual differences in transnational education. However, few studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on TNHE through the lens of the socialization, externalization, combination and internalization (SECI) model and investigated the extent to which teaching faculty can co-construct knowledge in collaborative teaching with the assistance of ICT. This study uses the theoretical framework of the SECI model to explore whether collaborative teaching was effective in TNHE during COVID-19. A quantitative questionnaire is conducted to examine the joint knowledge production by adding information technology utilization to the four knowledge-creation and knowledge-conversion processes. Finally, the study explores a SECI knowledge-creation model with technology integration for discussing collaborative teaching quality during COVID-19. The results imply that collaborative teaching management can be linked to the multidimensions of knowledge generation and transfer. It also recommends that pedagogical knowledge and technological expertise can enhance instructional design and teaching practices from the knowledge perspective and achieve sustainable development in THNE.",

Thus, trustworthy sources of information should be automatically identifiable using objective criteria.\n\n\nObjective\nThe purpose of this study was to automate the assessment of the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) criteria, enhancing our ability to pinpoint trustworthy health information sources.\n\n\nMethods\nA data set of 538 web pages displaying health content was collected from 43 health-related websites. HONcode criteria have been considered as web page and website levels. For the website-level criteria (confidentiality, transparency, financial disclosure, and advertising policy), a bag of keywords has been identified to assess the criteria using a rule-based model. For the web page–level criteria (authority, complementarity, justifiability, and attribution) several machine learning (ML) approaches were used. In total, 200 web pages were manually annotated until achieving a balanced representation in terms of frequency. In total, 3 ML models—random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)—were trained on the initial annotated data. A second step of training was implemented for the complementarity criterion using the BERT model for multiclass classification of the complementarity sentences obtained by annotation and data augmentation (positive, negative, and noncommittal sentences). Finally, the remaining web pages were classified using the selected model and 100 sentences were randomly selected for manual review.\n\n\nResults\nFor web page–level criteria, the random forest model showed a good performance for the attribution criterion while displaying subpar performance in the others. BERT and SVM had a stable performance across all the criteria. BERT had a better area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00 for neutral sentences, justifiability, and attribution, respectively. SVM had the overall better performance for the classification of complementarity with the AUC equal to 0.98. Finally, SVM and BERT had an equal AUC of 0.98 for the authority criterion. For the website level criteria, the rule-based model was able to retrieve web pages with an accuracy of 0.97 for confidentiality, 0.82 for transparency, and 0.51 for both financial disclosure and advertising policy. The final evaluation of the sentences determined 0.88 of precision and the agreement level of reviewers was computed at 0.82.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur results showed the potential power of automating the HONcode criteria assessment using ML approaches. This approach could be used with different types of pretrained models to accelerate the text annotation, and classification and to improve the performance in low-resource cases. Further work needs to be conducted to determine how to assign different weights to the criteria, as well as to identify additional characteristics that should be considered for consolidating these criteria into a comprehensive reliability score.\n",

We used US EPA Method 1642 to quantify concentrations of coliphage along with culture- and molecular-based enumeration of E. coli and Enterococcus sp, and human fecal source marker HF183. We also conducted a feasibility assessment to determine the utility of US EPA Method 1642 for application to routine recreational water monitoring. Ten sampling events were conducted at three sampling sites over the duration of a year. Average concentrations of somatic (SC) (log10 1.48 PFU/100 mL) and male-specific (MSC) coliphages (log10 1.00 PFU/100 mL) at all sites were low with SC found across a broader range (0.3–3.1 log10 PFU/100 mL) of concentrations compared to MSC (non-detect-1.7 log10 PFU/100 mL). A feasibility assessment was conducted across US EPA Method 1642 for coliphage enumeration, culture-based FIB, defined substrate technology (DST) approaches Enterolert™ and Colilert®, and quantitative microbial source tracking (qMST) US EPA Method 1696. US EPA Method 1642 had the longest processing times, but also was moderate in cost, compared to the DST and qMST molecular methods. Given the poor correlations between MSC and SC with FIB and qMST markers in this study and the cumbersome nature of US EPA Method 1642, the method may not be the most applicable method for use in systems impacted predominantly by stormwater and other non-point source pollution. Findings from this study, however, provide guidance on the application of fecal indicator virus in ambient coastal surface waters.",

Indonesia  has  hundreds  of  thousands  of  bridges  that  are  still  actively  in  use.  The  classic problem  with  infrastructure  management,  such  as  bridges,  is  that  large  numbers  are  generally  not  balanced  with adequate  bridge  maintenance  budgets.  Therefore,the  strategy  of  implementing  maintenance  and  repair  by preparing priorities becomes the only logical approach. To get a priority scale, a scoring mechanism is needed. The assessment  used by the  Ministry of Public Works and Public  Housing (PUPR) especiallythe  Bina  Marga  field is based on the bridge management and maintenance system, namely Bridge Management System (BMS) 1993. With BMS  1993,  the  condition  of  the  bridge  is  represented  by  the  Condition  Value  (NK)  of  the  bridge.  This  study  is based  on  existingNK,  prediction  of  NK  value  in  the  future.  The  predicted  model  developed  is  with  regression models. Regression  models are  combined  with  k-fold cross-validation to improve  the  accuracy rate  of the  model. The developed model produces regression models for all variables of condition values with a low error percentage that is in the range of MAPE = 10% and RMSE 0.15. Further significance tests with ANOVA are also conducted to test  the  effect  of  independent  variables  on  dependent  variables,  including  testing  on fit  models  to  show  the resulting model does not overfit and/or underfitting.",

The objective was to investigate the risk factors for severe fatigue in MHD patients and develop a prediction model.ResultsA total of 243 MHD patients were included in the study, and the incidence of severe fatigue was found to be 20.99%. Using age, body mass index, total cholesterol, and albumin levels, a predictive nomogram for fatigue was constructed. In the training set, the nomogram had an area under the curve of 0.851, sensitivity of 82.86%, specificity of 81.76%, and c‐index of 0.851. The nomogram was accurate in calibration and proved to be clinically useful.ConclusionThe nomogram developed in this study is a practical and reliable tool for quickly identifying severe fatigue in MHD patients.",

        "abstract": "This research aims to enhance the accuracy of Construction Cost Index (CCI) forecasting using Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (ES) by optimizing its parameters, focusing on minimizing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for precise CCI forecasts. To reach this aim, The Holt-Winters model parameters are optimized through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Walk-Forward Cross-Validation (WFCV). PSO, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, is being applied to search for optimal values of the smoothing parameters (alpha, beta, and gamma) that determine the weightage of past observations, trends, and seasonality, respectively. WFCV is assessed the model's performance and ensures robustness. Reduced MAPEs of 22 for CCI forecasts and 2 for training data are the findings of the optimized Holt-Winters model. The obtained alpha, beta, and gamma values are 0.99, 0.77, and 0, respectively, highlighting the importance of while neglecting seasonality. Convergence graphs demonstrate the superiority of the optimization approach over conventional parameter values or random selections. By employing PSO and WFCV, the study efficiently fine-tunes the Holt-Winters model for precise CCI forecasting. Optimized parameter values enable data driven decision-making in construction project cost estimation and budget management. This research contributes a reliable and robust optimization methodology for CCI forecasting, supporting advancements in the field.",

It is very important in the industrial practice and sometimes there are very particular cases that cannot be addressed and solved by traditional methods.\nThe rotor model addressed in this paper has been initially presented in a previous work [1], with the aim to introduce a procedure for “predicting the effects of balancing” at rotational speeds that are higher than those possible on balancing machines.\nIn this work, the balancing of the same rotor model is addressed by a maintenance standpoint, considering the case of a rotor showing bending at its neutral axis. This situation may be present, for several reasons, in rotors sent to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for repair/refurbishment after several years of operation, or as consequence of emergency events that may cause local deformation and/or require significant re-machining. To some extent, this situation can still allow for High-Speed Balancing (HSB) of such shafts. Nonetheless the availability of prediction models able to evaluate in a relatively short time the feasibility of HSB, in advance of starting any hardware activity, is of paramount importance to avoid costs and time impacts.\nIn this paper, a procedure to address the feasibility of balancing of an industrial steam turbine rotor, starting from runout measurement of its bowed shape, is presented. Hence, results of several approaches are discussed for identification of their limits of applicability. Eventually the result of an analytical model including the deflected shape of the shaft is compared with HSB runs.",

However, current assessment methods are predominantly geared towards mature technologies, limiting our capacity for a systematic and quantitative evaluation of emerging technologies. Overcoming this challenge is crucial for accurate technology evaluation across various fields and generations. To address this challenge, we present a novel approach that leverages bibliometrics, specifically paper citation networks, to gauge shifts in the flow of knowledge throughout the technological evolution. This method is capable of discerning a wide array of trends in technology development and serves as a highly effective tool for evaluating technological progress. In this paper, we showcase the accuracy and applicability of this approach by applying it to the realm of mobile communication technology. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of its quantitative results with other conventional assessment methods. The practical significance of our model lies in providing a nuanced understanding of emerging technologies within a specific domain, enabling informed decisions, and fostering strategic planning in technology-oriented fields. In terms of originality and value, this model serves as a comprehensive tool for assessing technological progress, quantifying emerging technologies, facilitating the evaluation of diverse technological trajectories, and efficiently informing technology policy-making processes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn recent years, there have been several calls by practitioners of machine learning to provide more guidelines on how to use its methods and techniques. For example, the current literature on resampling methods is confusing and sometimes contradictory; worse, there are sometimes no practical guidelines offered at all. To address this shortcoming, a simulation study was conducted that evaluated ridge regression models fitted on five real-world datasets. The study compared the performance of four resampling methods, namely, Monte Carlo resampling, bootstrap, k-fold cross-validation, and repeated k-fold cross-validation. The goal was to find the best-fitting λ (regularization) parameter that would minimize mean squared error, by using nine variations of these resampling methods. For each of the nine resampling variations, 1,000 runs were performed to see how often a good fit, average fit, and poor fit λ value would be chosen. The resampling method that chose good fit values the greatest number of times was deemed the best method. Based on the results of the investigation, three general recommendations are made: (1) repeated k-fold cross-validation is the best method to select as a general-purpose resampling method; (2) k = 10 folds is a good choice in k-fold cross-validation; (3) Monte Carlo and bootstrap are underperformers, so they are not recommended as general-purpose resampling methods. At the same time, no resampling method was found to be uniformly better than the others.",

Biofidelity of the lower extremity model was evaluated against experiments with impact loading equivalent to underbody blast. The model response was found to match well with the experimental data for the average impactor speeds of 7 and 9.3 m/s resulting in an overall correlation and analysis rating of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. The model response was then used to investigate response for antipersonnel mine explosion where the numerical setup consists of a charge mass of 40 g trinitrotoluene placed at a depth of 50 mm below the heel. The explosion was modeled using Multi Material‐Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method. The model was subjected to the graded input in terms of variation in standoff distance and mass of explosive to investigate the sensitivity of the model. The model found sensitive to the threat definition and predicted an increase of 110% in peak fluid‐structure interaction force with 20% reduction in its time to peak and 29% increase in peak calcaneus axial force with a reduction of 33% in its time to peak when explosive mass varied from 40 g to 100 g. The location of the explosive below the foot was discovered to have significant effect on the injury pattern in near‐field explosion. A comparative study suggested that the model predicted similar response and damage pattern compared to experimental data.",

In Study 2 (N = 109), we administered the version retained from Study 1—termed Micro-PROMS—with the full-length PROMS, finding a short-to-long-form correlation of r = .72.

Results showed adequate internal consistency ($$\\overline{\\omega}$$\n\nω\n¯\n\n = .73) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .83). Findings supported convergent validity of the Micro-PROMS (r = .59 with the MET, p < .01) as well as discriminant validity with short-term and working memory (r ≲ .20).

        "abstract": "Clew Bay is an important aquaculture production area in Ireland. In this study, we focused on a high-resolution simulation of the Clew Bay region based on a regional ocean modeling system (ROMS). Freshwater discharges from eight rivers are included in the model and a wetting–drying scheme has been implemented. The Clew Bay model simulation was validated and calibrated with available observations (e.g., acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), vertical salinity and temperature profiles, and a tide gauge) in the geographic area of the model domain. High correlations were found between the model data and observed temperature, salinity and water levels, along with small root mean square errors. This indicates that the model is able to reproduce the oceanographic phenomena in the study area. The Taylor diagram analysis showed a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.99) between the observed bottom temperature in the Inner Bay and Clew Bay model, along with a small centered root mean square error (RMSD = 0.5 °C). High correlation coefficients (R > 0.80) were found between the model and the two ADCPs for the zonal current component. There was a resemblance in structure between the model and the observed salinity profiles, indicating that freshwater was correctly implemented in the model. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between the model and the tidal sea surface height (SSH) was 0.99, with an RMSD of 0.09 m. We discovered that wind direction and speed had a significant impact on the bay’s water inflow rate. The model outputs can be used to provide scientists, fishermen, and decision-makers with hydrodynamic information on ocean conditions in the bay.",

So far, no published methods have been validated using matrix standards for oleuropein quantification in olive leaves.ObjectivesThe study aimed to develop an HPLC method for oleuropein determination in olive leaves using spiked matrix standards prepared from a blank olive leaf matrix, to validate the method with respect to aqueous standards, and cross‐validate the HPLC method with UPLC‐MS and UPLC‐UV techniques.MethodologyOleuropein was extracted into methanol and analysed by HPLC with fluorescence detection (FLD; excitation and emission wavelengths 281 and 316 nm, respectively) and by UPLC‐MS‐UV. For validation, calibration curves of spiked matrix standards (0.4 to 4.8 mg/g) were analysed by the three methods over several days. Oleuropein was then analysed in French olive varieties.ResultsFor the HPLC‐FLD method, repeatability and intermediate precision were less than 5% RSD and linearity was demonstrated by the Fischer test. Differences in results of the spiked placebos by the three methods were non‐significant, as confirmed by ANOVA. Extraction recovery was >90%, and there was a strong linear relationship between authentic and spiked matrix standards. The determination of oleuropein in French olive varieties is reported, including analysis in “Olivière” cultivar for the first time, leaves of which contained twice the amount of oleuropein compared with “Picholine”.ConclusionAccurate quantification of oleuropein is possible using aqueous standards. Cross‐validation indicates that selective analysis can equally be carried out by HPLC or by UPLC‐MS techniques.",

As the number of observations n goes to infinity while keeping the number of folds K fixed, the K-fold cross validation error is √ n-consistent for the expected out-of-sample error and has an asymptotically normal distribution. A consistent estimate of the asymptotic variance is derived and used to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the expected out-of-sample error. A hypothesis test is developed for comparing two estimators’ expected out-of-sample errors and a subsampling procedure is used to obtain critical values. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the asymptotic validity of our confidence intervals for the expected out-of-sample error and investigate the size and power properties of our test. In our empirical application, we use our estimator selection test to compare the out-of-sample predictive performance of OLS, Neural Networks, and Random Forests for predicting the sale price of a domain name in a GoDaddy expiry auction.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionIn Brazil, there are few studies that investigate the support needs of families that have handicap children in their daily context. This study aims to adapt and validate the Family Needs Assessment (FNA) scale for use with families of children and adolescents with disabilities in Brazil.MethodTwo studies were conducted. The first study involved the cross-cultural adaptation of the scale, resulting in the Brazilian version of the FNA, which is called Avaliação das Necessidades da Família (ANF). The FNA comprises 49 items with high internal consistency (α = 0.98). The second study validated the FNA using a sample of 151 families with children and adolescents with disabilities.ResultsThe structure of the scale was confirmed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), which grouped 46 items into seven dimensions. The scale demonstrated good fit (RMSEA = 0.041, SRMR = 0.063), satisfactory convergent validity (rs = −0.27, p &lt; 0.001), and high levels of reliability (α = 0.92, ω = 0.94) and test–retest consistency (R1F = 0.98).DiscussionThe FNA is a valid, reliable, and accurate measure for assessing the needs of Brazilian families with children and adolescents with disabilities under 18 years of age.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nSelf‐care is the primary means of caring for a chronic condition. Therefore, it is necessary to assess it by using a good validity and reliability instrument. The Self-Care of Chronic Illness Inventory (SC-CII) is a generic instrument developed to measure self-care processes behaviors using three separate scales in patients with chronic illness. The original cross-cultural assessment concluded the need for future studies sampling patients from different sites to increase the generalizability of the psychometric evaluation results. It was unclear whether this tool had sound psychometrics properties in the context of Spanish culture. The purpose of this study was to cross-culturally adapt the SC-CII, test its psychometric properties and validate its use among Spanish people with chronic diseases.\n\nMethods\nA cross-cultural translation of the SC-CII was performed from English to Spanish. The psychometric evaluation was conducted in a sample of 350 patients with chronic conditions through a multicenter cross-sectional study based on the STROBE guideline. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews during 2022. Internal validity was assessed with Confirmatory Factor Analysis, internal consistency reliability with Cronbach alpha for unidimensional scales and McDonald's Omega reliability coefficient for multidimensional scales.\n\nResults\nMost (63.4%) participants were older adults aged 65 years or older with a mean age of 65.45 ± 14.97. The average number of chronic conditions reported was 2.81%; the most common conditions were hypertension (52.3%), musculoskeletal disorders (46.3%) and diabetes (38.9%). Patients reported adequate self-care behaviors in all three scales of the SC-CII. The Self-Care Maintenance and Management scales were multidimensional, and the Self-Care Monitoring scale was unidimensional. In Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the Self-Care Maintenance and Monitoring scales had satisfactory fit indices. The Self-care Management scale had acceptable fit indices. The Omega reliability coefficient for multidimensional scales was 0.75 (Self-Care Maintenance) and 0.72 (Self-Care Management). The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the Self-Care Monitoring scale was 0.85. Item-total correlations were all significant except one. Test–retest reliability showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92.\n\nConclusions\nThe SC-CII has appropriate psychometrics characteristics and is a culturally suitable and reliable instrument for assessing to the self-care behaviors of patients with chronic disease in Spain. The scale provides a simple and rapid solution to assess the self-care process.\n",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nNeurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are prevalent among older adults worldwide. Early diagnosis of NDD is challenging yet crucial. Gait status has been identified as an indicator of early-stage NDD changes and can play a significant role in diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Historically, gait assessment has relied on intricate but imprecise scales by trained professionals or required patients to wear additional equipment, causing discomfort. Advancements in artificial intelligence may completely transform this and offer a novel approach to gait evaluation.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to offer patients a noninvasive, entirely contactless gait assessment and provide health care professionals with precise gait assessment results covering all common gait-related parameters to assist in diagnosis and rehabilitation planning.\n\n\nMethods\nData collection involved motion data from 41 different participants aged 25 to 85 (mean 57.51, SD 12.93) years captured in motion sequences using the Azure Kinect (Microsoft Corp; a 3D camera with a 30-Hz sampling frequency). Support vector machine (SVM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) classifiers trained using spatiotemporal features extracted from raw data were used to identify gait types in each walking frame. Gait semantics could then be obtained from the frame labels, and all the gait parameters could be calculated accordingly. For optimal generalization performance of the model, the classifiers were trained using a 10-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed algorithm was also compared with the previous best heuristic method. Qualitative and quantitative feedback from medical staff and patients in actual medical scenarios was extensively collected for usability analysis.\n\n\nResults\nThe evaluations comprised 3 aspects. Regarding the classification results from the 2 classifiers, Bi-LSTM achieved an average precision, recall, and F1-score of 90.54%, 90.41%, and 90.38%, respectively, whereas these metrics were 86.99%, 86.62%, and 86.67%, respectively, for SVM. Moreover, the Bi-LSTM–based method attained 93.2% accuracy in gait segmentation evaluation (tolerance set to 2), whereas that of the SVM-based method achieved only 77.5% accuracy. For the final gait parameter calculation result, the average error rate of the heuristic method, SVM, and Bi-LSTM was 20.91% (SD 24.69%), 5.85% (SD 5.45%), and 3.17% (SD 2.75%), respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study demonstrated that the Bi-LSTM–based approach can effectively support accurate gait parameter assessment, assisting medical professionals in making early diagnoses and reasonable rehabilitation plans for patients with NDD.\n",

At internal validation, data resampling techniques, e.g., cross-validation, are frequently employed to correct for optimism in these model performance criteria. Especially with small samples or rare events, leave-one-out cross-validation is a popular choice.\n\nMethods\nUsing simulations and a real data example, we compared the effect of different resampling techniques on the estimation of c-statistics, discrimination slopes, and Brier scores for three estimators of logistic regression models, including the maximum likelihood and two maximum penalized likelihood estimators.\n\nResults\nOur simulation study confirms earlier studies reporting that leave-one-out cross-validated c-statistics can be strongly biased towards zero. In addition, our study reveals that this bias is even more pronounced for model estimators shrinking estimated probabilities towards the observed event fraction, such as ridge regression. Leave-one-out cross-validation also provided pessimistic estimates of the discrimination slope but nearly unbiased estimates of the Brier score.\n\nConclusions\nWe recommend to use leave-pair-out cross-validation, fivefold cross-validation with repetitions, the enhanced or the .632+ bootstrap to estimate c-statistics, and leave-pair-out or fivefold cross-validation to estimate discrimination slopes.\n",

        "abstract": "The wetland ecosystems are home to multiple species of flora and fauna and provide a myriad of ecosystem services from which people directly and indirectly benefit. By nature, ecosystem services are intrinsic characteristics of such areas and only recently their values have been rec- ognized as beneficial, for local communities in particular. Despite such benefits, those areas are often threatened by new development and land-use practices, favouring quick economic growth, especially true in developing countries like Albania. Yet another threat to such ecosystems is climate change, further underlining the imminent need to protect them. Such a task is difficult to perform when the awareness level of the community for these topics is low and the scarcity of data is evident.  This paper explores how to tackle those two challenges, low community awareness and data scar- city, by intertwining different methods with the specific aim of evaluating ecosystem services. To better illustrate the process of data generating and the methods used, this paper will focus only on one ecosystem service, which is carbon storage and sequestration. Through it, we will analyse the different methods available for generating such data and ultimately give a specific value to this ecosystem service, to make it comparable with other economic activities. The methods that will be analysed vary from the use of available open data sources to field measurements. This research was conducted in the frame of the WBC-RRI.net Horizon 2020 Project.",

In the present study, we generated scrambled stimuli of short vocalizations taken from the Montreal Affective Voices database (Belin et al., Behav Res Methods, 40(2):531–539, 2008) by applying four different scrambling methods (frequency-, phase-, and two time-scrambling transformations). The original stimuli and their scrambled versions were judged by 60 participants for the apparency of a human voice, gender, and valence of the expressions, or, if no human voice was detected, for the valence of the subjective response to the stimulus. The human-likeness ratings were reduced for all scrambled versions relative to the original stimuli, albeit to a lesser extent for phase-scrambled versions of neutral bursts. For phase-scrambled neutral bursts, valence ratings were equivalent to those of the original neutral burst. All other scrambled versions were rated as slightly unpleasant, indicating that they should be used with caution due to their potential aversiveness.",

The experiments have been conducted following the EN 838:2010 standard in the range of 16 to 320 µg/m3 (0.005 to 0.1 ppm). The study is part of the Concawe project on “accurate low-dose benzene exposure assessment, dose-specific metabolism and potential early markers” aiming at developing a methodology to monitor benzene exposures at low levels in environments typical of the petroleum industry. Diffusive sampling offers a reliable alternative to pumped sampling methods, intrinsic safety in potentially explosive atmospheres, lightness and ease of use. The tested diffusive sampler is radiello™, two alternative configurations of the sampler can be used: RAD130, packed with activated charcoal, suitable for solvent desorption and analysis by HRGC-FID, and RAD145, packed with graphitised charcoal, suitable for thermal desorption and analysis by HRGC-MS. For both configurations the sampler performances have fulfilled all requisites of the EN 838:2010 standard, in particular: bias due to the selection of a non-ideal sorbent is lower than 10% (no significant back diffusion of benzene due to concentration change in the atmosphere); bias due to storage of samples for up to 2 months is lower than 10%; nominal uptake rate for benzene on RAD130 is 74.6 ml/min and on RAD145 is 32.3 ml/min; expanded uncertainty of the sampling and analytical method is 20.2% on RAD130 and 26.1% on RAD145.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers the possibility of collaboration between multiple devices while maintaining data confidentiality, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Though FL can keep local data private, it may encounter problems when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), insufficient local training samples or cyber-attacks. This paper introduces algorithms that can provide a reliable aggregation of the global model by investigating the accuracy of models received from clients. This allows reducing the influence of less confident nodes, who were potentially attacked or unable to perform successful training. The analysis includes the proposed FedAcc and FedAccSize algorithms, together with their new extension based on the Lasso regression, FedLasso. FedAcc and FedAccSize set the confidence in each client based only on local models’ accuracy, while FedLasso exploits additional details related to predictions, like predicted class probabilities, to support a refined aggregation. The ability of the proposed algorithms to protect against intruders or underperforming clients is demonstrated experimentally using testing scenarios involving independent and identically distributed (IID) data as well as non-IID data. The comparison with the established FedAvg and FedAvgM algorithms shows that exploiting the quality of the client models is essential for reliable aggregation, which enables rapid and robust improvement in the global model.",

We hypothesize that these constructs have shown mixed associations with psychological constructs because the factor structure underlying social media use (SMU) has not been fully identified. We conducted three studies with college students. In Study 1 ( N = 176), we collected data about participants’ SMU, informing item generation. In Study 2 ( N = 311), we tested two factor structures: (a) passive, active social, and active non-social and (b) a hypothesized four-factor structure. Neither confirmatory model produced acceptable fits, but an exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor model: belief-based, consumption-based, image-based, and comparison-based SMU. This four-factor structure was supported in Study 3 ( N = 397), which was preregistered, via a confirmatory factor analysis. The subscale items showed good internal consistencies, and evidence is presented for convergent validity. These factors represent a novel classification of people’s SMU that can be measured with the Social Media Use Scale. ",

Early identification of patients at risk of POD can considerably aid prevention.\n\n\nMethods\nWe have developed a preoperative POD risk prediction algorithm using data from eight studies identified during a systematic review and providing individual-level data. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for predictor selection and internal validation of the final penalised logistic regression model. The external validation used data from university hospitals in Switzerland and Germany.\n\n\nResults\nDevelopment included 2,250 surgical (excluding cardiac and intracranial) patients 60 years of age or older, 444 of whom developed POD. The final model included age, body mass index, American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score, history of delirium, cognitive impairment, medications, optional C-reactive protein (CRP), surgical risk and whether the operation is a laparotomy/thoracotomy. At internal validation, the algorithm had an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77–0.82) with CRP and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77–0.82) without CRP. The external validation consisted of 359 patients, 87 of whom developed POD. The external validation yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.68–0.80).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe algorithm is named PIPRA (Pre-Interventional Preventive Risk Assessment), has European conformity (ce) certification, is available at http://pipra.ch/ and is accepted for clinical use. It can be used to optimise patient care and prioritise interventions for vulnerable patients and presents an effective way to implement POD prevention strategies in clinical practice.\n",

These patients were randomly divided into training set (N = 674) and validation set (N = 289) at a ratio of 7:3. Clinical characteristics were utilized to establish a nomogram for the prediction of AKI during ICU stay. These variables were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) regression and included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables with P-values less than 0.05 were included in the final model. A nomogram was constructed based on the final model. The predicted accuracy of the nomogram was assessed by calculating the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). Moreover, calibration curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HL test) were performed to evaluate model performance. Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated the clinical net benefit of the model.\n\nResults\nA multivariable model that included 6 variables: weight, SOFA score, white blood cell count, albumin, chronic heart failure, and sepsis. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.82, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the training set and validation set were 0.82 (95% confidence interval:0.79–0.86) and 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.70–0.82), respectively. Calibration plots showed good consistency between predicted and observed outcomes in both the training and validation sets. DCA confirmed the clinical value of the model and its good impact on actual decision-making.\n\nConclusion\nWe identified risk factors associated with the development of AKI in patients with AP. A risk prediction model for AKI in ICU patients with AP was constructed, and improving the treatment strategy of relevant factors in the model can reduce the risk of AKI in AP patients.\n",

We also introduced soft tissue sliding under the ischial tuberosities (ITs). The initial model was adapted for seating applications with low modulus soft tissue material property and mesh refinements for buttock regions, etc. We compared the contact forces and pressure-related parameters simulated using the adult HBM with those obtained experimentally from the person whose data was used for the model development. Four seat configurations, with the seat pan angle varying from 0° to 15° and seat-to-back angle fixed at 100°, were tested.Results: The adult HBM could correctly simulate the contact forces on the backrest, seat pan, and foot support with an average error of less than 22.3 N and 15.5 N in the horizontal and vertical directions, which is small considering the body weight (785 N). In terms of contact area, peak, and mean pressure, the simulation matched well with the experiment for the seat pan. With soft tissue sliding, higher soft tissue compression was obtained in agreement with the observations from recent MRI studies.Discussion: The present adult model could be used as a reference using a morphing tool as proposed in PIPER. The model will be published openly online as part of the PIPER open-source project (www.PIPER-project.org) to facilitate its reuse and improvement as well as its specific adaptation for different applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nCurrently, there are few such studies about establishing the frailty prediction model on the basis of the research on the factors influencing frailty in older patients, which can better predict frailty and identify its risk factors, and then guide the formulation of intervention measures precisely, especially in the hospital setting in China. Meanwhile, comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can provide measurable and substantial health improvements for frail older people. The study aimed to develop a nomogram model for frailty risk among hospitalised older people using CGA data and validated its predictive performance for providing a basis for medical staff to grasp the risk and risk factors of older inpatients’ frailty conveniently and accurately, and to formulate reasonable nursing intervention plan.\n\nMethods\nWe used CGA data of individuals over age 64. Demographic characteristics, geriatric syndrome assessment, and frailty assessment based on the FRAIL scale were included as potential predictors. Significant variables in univariate analysis were used to construct risk models by logistic regression analysis. We used the root mean square (rms) to develop the nomogram prediction model for frailty based on independent clinical factors. Nomogram performance was internally validated with Bootstrap resampling. The final model was externally validated using an independent validation data set and was assessed for discrimination and calibration.\n\nResults\nData from 2226 eligible older inpatients were extracted. Five hundred sixty-two older inpatients (25.25%) suffered from frailty. The final prediction model included damaged skin, MNA-SF, GDS-15, Morse risk scores, hospital admission, ICI-Q-SF, Braden score, MMSE, BI scores, and Caprini scores. The prediction model displayed fair discrimination. The calibration curve demonstrated that the probabilities of frailty predicted by the nomogram were satisfactorily matched.\n\nConclusions\nThe prediction model to identify hospitalised older people at high risk for frailty using comprehensive geriatric assessment data displayed fair discrimination and good predictive calibration. Therefore, it is inexpensive, easily applied, and accessible in clinical practice, containing variables routinely collected and readily available through consultation. It will be valuable for grasp older inpatients at high risk of frailty and risk factors in hospital setting to guide the formulation of intervention measures precisely for reversing and preventing frailty.\n",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nAssessment of the quality of medical evidence available on the web is a critical step in the preparation of systematic reviews. Existing tools that automate parts of this task validate the quality of individual studies but not of entire bodies of evidence and focus on a restricted set of quality criteria.\n\n\nObjective\nWe proposed a quality assessment task that provides an overall quality rating for each body of evidence (BoE), as well as finer-grained justification for different quality criteria according to the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation formalization framework. For this purpose, we constructed a new data set and developed a machine learning baseline system (EvidenceGRADEr).\n\n\nMethods\nWe algorithmically extracted quality-related data from all summaries of findings found in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Each BoE was defined by a set of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome criteria and assigned a quality grade (high, moderate, low, or very low) together with quality criteria (justification) that influenced that decision. Different statistical data, metadata about the review, and parts of the review text were extracted as support for grading each BoE. After pruning the resulting data set with various quality checks, we used it to train several neural-model variants. The predictions were compared against the labels originally assigned by the authors of the systematic reviews.\n\n\nResults\nOur quality assessment data set, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Quality of Evidence, contains 13,440 instances, or BoEs labeled for quality, originating from 2252 systematic reviews published on the internet from 2002 to 2020. On the basis of a 10-fold cross-validation, the best neural binary classifiers for quality criteria detected risk of bias at 0.78 F1 (P=.68; R=0.92) and imprecision at 0.75 F1 (P=.66; R=0.86), while the performance on inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias criteria was lower (F1 in the range of 0.3-0.4). The prediction of the overall quality grade into 1 of the 4 levels resulted in 0.5 F1. When casting the task as a binary problem by merging the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation classes (high+moderate vs low+very low-quality evidence), we attained 0.74 F1. We also found that the results varied depending on the supporting information that is provided as an input to the models.\n\n\nConclusions\nDifferent factors affect the quality of evidence in the context of systematic reviews of medical evidence. Some of these (risk of bias and imprecision) can be automated with reasonable accuracy. Other quality dimensions such as indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias prove more challenging for machine learning, largely because they are much rarer. This technology could substantially reduce reviewer workload in the future and expedite quality assessment as part of evidence synthesis.\n",

To facilitate and hasten the development of such low-emissions technologies, accurate predictions of the spray characteristics are needed. The objective of the present study is to validate the predictive capabilities of a stochastic breakup model for turbulent transverse jets over a wide range of representative pressures and atomization characteristics. The effect of turbulence modeling is also assessed to provide accurate and computationally less expensive Eulerian-Lagrangian transient approaches. To do so, the predictions made with the large eddy simulation (LES) approach for different subgrid-scale (SGS) models and with the synthetic eddy method (SEM) are compared to the ones made using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with and without a turbulent dispersion model. The sensitivity of the numerical methodology to the upstream velocity profile, pressure, and momentum flux ratio were also assessed. Properly accounting for the upstream gas velocity profile was found to be critical to ensure accurate predictions of the spray characteristics. The unsteady RANS (URANS) turbulent approach coupled with the turbulent dispersion model showed good agreement with experimental data, but the LES approach tends to overpredict the spray penetration and underpredict the Sauter mean diameter (SMD). This could be due to the lower turbulent interactions it predicts, which may lead to lower momentum transfer between the phases.\n\n",

        "abstract": "IntroductionOver the past few years, the healthcare industry has undergone a significant transformation where patients’ perceptions of healthcare have gained a huge importance in assessing quality. Considering that it is now highly competitive, their contentment is a vital aspect in improving performance. However, practitioners in developing countries have traditionally overlooked the importance of patient views in healthcare, and this neglect is particularly prevalent in low-resource settings such as the State University of Haiti Hospital. The aim of this study is to assess patient satisfaction and identify influencing factors.Methods and analysisWe will conduct a mixed-methods cross-sectional survey at Haiti’s largest hospital centre from January to August 2024. First, patient satisfaction will be assessed using RAND Corporation’s 18-Item-Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, a valid self-administered questionnaire with strong potential for use in different settings. It will be translated into Creole and then tested in a pilot study. Second, a qualitative study based on individual interviews will explore patients’ views on the care they have received. Data analysis will include descriptive statistics, χ2tests, logistic regression and thematic analysis.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval is granted from the Laboratoire Médecine Ethique et Société. Findings will be published in a corresponding peer-reviewed journal, shared with hospital staff and students. Social media posts, blog posts and conference debates will also be considered.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAimThe aim of the present study was to compare the Preece–Baines 1 (PB1) model fit between longitudinal and cross‐sectional data in male soccer players and to adjust the height growth curve by maturity status.MethodsA final sample of 57 male Portuguese soccer players from professional soccer academies was included. Longitudinal height records were measured between 8 and 17 times in each subject from 2–8 years to 14–17 years. Additionally, longitudinal height records were used as cross‐sectional data along with 1087 cross‐sectional height records taken from 602 Portuguese soccer players. Skeletal age was estimated by Tanner‐Whitehouse III method from a left hand–wrist radiograph. Age at peak height velocity (PHV) was estimated by PB1 model for longitudinal and cross‐sectional data and by maturity status.ResultsNo significant differences were found between all the longitudinal estimates of 57 players and the random cross‐sectional samples for, S1 parameter and for growth velocity at PHV, at TO, and for age at PHV. The age at PHV in early, on‐time, and late maturers were 12.26, 12.9, and 13.58 years, respectively.ConclusionPB1 adjusted the height growth of Portuguese male soccer players from cross‐sectional data, obtaining an estimate PHV very similar to that found from longitudinal data. A maturity time difference of ≈0.6 years was found between the age at PHV of on‐time, early, and on‐time and late maturity state.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis article investigates the performance and accuracy of continuous Real‐Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) position tracking for hydromorphological surveys, based on a comprehensive river restoration monitoring campaign. The aim of the research was to assess the method's suitability for efficient data collection in turbid, wadable rivers with sparse canopy conditions, and responds to the water management sector's increasing demand for efficient, low‐cost, and robust survey techniques. The methodological approach involved comparing manual, cross‐sectional water depth measurements to water depth estimations obtained by applying different interpolation methods to the continuous tracking data. The results demonstrate good agreement between both datasets (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.13 m). When using a local standard deviation filter to remove noisy RTK‐GNSS measurements, estimation performance increased significantly (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.06 m). The filter's influence on the hydromorphological habitat statistics mean water depth and coefficient of variation was limited but proved to be relevant for reach‐scale assessments of hydromorphological diversity. Based on a correlation analysis of >106 RTK‐GNSS position logs, we furthermore assessed the impact of tree canopy on RTK‐GNSS measurement accuracy and observed a strong influence within 6.5 m from the canopy border. Estimated accuracy deteriorated noticeably when canopy penetration exceeded 1 m, and accuracies >1 m were common beyond 4 m penetration. The study highlights the efficiency gains achieved with RTK‐GNSS tracking, and showcases its potential for hydromorphological surveys and streamgaging applications in challenging conditions, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods and remote sensing techniques.",
