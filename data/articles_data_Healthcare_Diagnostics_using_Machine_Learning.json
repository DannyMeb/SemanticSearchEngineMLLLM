        "abstract": "Skin lesions are essential for the early detection and management of a number of dermatological disorders. Learning-based methods for skin lesion analysis have drawn much attention lately because of improvements in computer vision and machine learning techniques. A review of the most-recent methods for skin lesion classification, segmentation, and detection is presented in this survey paper. The significance of skin lesion analysis in healthcare and the difficulties of physical inspection are discussed in this survey paper. The review of state-of-the-art papers targeting skin lesion classification is then covered in depth with the goal of correctly identifying the type of skin lesion from dermoscopic, macroscopic, and other lesion image formats. The contribution and limitations of various techniques used in the selected study papers, including deep learning architectures and conventional machine learning methods, are examined. The survey then looks into study papers focused on skin lesion segmentation and detection techniques that aimed to identify the precise borders of skin lesions and classify them accordingly. These techniques make it easier to conduct subsequent analyses and allow for precise measurements and quantitative evaluations. The survey paper discusses well-known segmentation algorithms, including deep-learning-based, graph-based, and region-based ones. The difficulties, datasets, and evaluation metrics particular to skin lesion segmentation are also discussed. Throughout the survey, notable datasets, benchmark challenges, and evaluation metrics relevant to skin lesion analysis are highlighted, providing a comprehensive overview of the field. The paper concludes with a summary of the major trends, challenges, and potential future directions in skin lesion classification, segmentation, and detection, aiming to inspire further advancements in this critical domain of dermatological research.",

        "abstract": "Epilepsy is a life-threatening neurological brain disorder that gives rise to recurrent unprovoked seizures. It occurs due to abnormal chemical changes in our brains. For many years, studies have been conducted to support the automatic diagnosis of epileptic seizures for clinicians’ ease. For that, several studies entail machine learning methods for early predicting epileptic seizures. Mainly, feature extraction methods have been used to extract the right features from the EEG data generated by the EEG machine. Then various machine learning classifiers are used for the classification process. This study provides a systematic literature review of the feature selection process and classification performance. This review was limited to finding the most used feature extraction methods and the classifiers used for accurate classification of normal to epileptic seizures. The existing literature was examined from well-known repositories such as MDPI, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Elsevier, ACM, Springer link, and others. Furthermore, a taxonomy was created that recapitulates the state-of-the-art used solutions for this problem. We also studied the nature of different benchmark and unbiased datasets and gave a rigorous analysis of the working of classifiers. Finally, we concluded the research by presenting the gaps, challenges, and opportunities that can further help researchers predict epileptic seizures.",

        "abstract": "Heart disease is one of the most known and deadly diseases in the world, and many people lose their lives from this disease every year. Early detection of this disease is vital to save people’s lives. Machine Learning (ML), an artificial intelligence technology, is one of the most convenient, fastest, and low-cost ways to detect disease. In this study, we aim to obtain an ML model that can predict heart disease with the highest possible performance using the Cleveland heart disease dataset. The features in the dataset used to train the model and the selection of the ML algorithm have a significant impact on the performance of the model. To avoid overfitting (due to the curse of dimensionality) due to the large number of features in the Cleveland dataset, the dataset was reduced to a lower dimensional subspace using the Jellyfish optimization algorithm. The Jellyfish algorithm has a high convergence speed and is flexible to find the best features. The models obtained by training the feature-selected dataset with different ML algorithms were tested, and their performances were compared. The highest performance was obtained for the SVM classifier model trained on the dataset with the Jellyfish algorithm, with Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Area Under Curve of 98.56%, 98.37%, 98.47%, and 94.48%, respectively. The results show that the combination of the Jellyfish optimization algorithm and SVM classifier has the highest performance for use in heart disease prediction.",

        "abstract": "Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) occurs when the coronary vessels become hardened and narrowed, limiting blood flow to the heart muscles. It is the most common type of heart disease and has the highest mortality rate. Early diagnosis of CAD can prevent the disease from progressing and can make treatment easier. Optimal treatment, in addition to the early detection of CAD, can improve the prognosis for these patients. This study proposes a new method for non-invasive diagnosis of CAD using iris images. In this study, iridology, a method of analyzing the iris to diagnose health conditions, was combined with image processing techniques to detect the disease in a total of 198 volunteers, 94 with CAD and 104 without. The iris was transformed into a rectangular format using the integral differential operator and the rubber sheet methods, and the heart region was cropped according to the iris map. Features were extracted using wavelet transform, first-order statistical analysis, a Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and a Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM). The model’s performance was evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, score, mean, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. The proposed model has a 93% accuracy rate for predicting CAD using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. With the proposed method, coronary artery disease can be preliminarily diagnosed by iris analysis without needing electrocardiography, echocardiography, and effort tests. Additionally, the proposed method can be easily used to support telediagnosis applications for coronary artery disease in integrated telemedicine systems.",

        "abstract": "Despite tremendous developments in continuous blood glucose measurement (CBGM) sensors, they are still not accurate for all patients with diabetes. As glucose concentration in the blood is <1% of the total blood volume, it is challenging to accurately measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid using CBGM sensors due to within-patient and between-patient variations. To address this issue, we developed a novel data-driven approach to accurately predict CBGM values using personalized calibration and machine learning. First, we scientifically divided measured blood glucose into smaller groups, namely, hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL), nondiabetic (81–115 mg/dL), prediabetes (116–150 mg/dL), diabetes (151–181 mg/dL), severe diabetes (181–250 mg/dL), and critical diabetes (>250 mg/dL). Second, we separately trained each group using different machine learning models based on patients’ personalized parameters, such as physical activity, posture, heart rate, breath rate, skin temperature, and food intake. Lastly, we used multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the D1NAMO dataset (training to test ratio: 70:30) and grid search for hyperparameter optimization to predict accurate blood glucose concentrations. We successfully applied our proposed approach in nine patients with type 1 diabetes and observed that the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) decreased from 17.8% to 8.3%.",

        "abstract": "Backgraund. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a modern high-tech and informative method for detecting pathology of the retina and preretinal layers of the vitreous body. However, the description and interpretation of the research results require high qualifications and special training of an ophthalmologist, and significant time expenditure for the doctor and the patient. At the same time, the use of mathematical models based on artificial neural networks (ANN- models) currently makes it possible to automate many processes associated with image processing. Therefore, solving problems associated with automating the process of classifying OCT images based on ANN models is actual.\r\nAims. To develop architectures of mathematical (computer) models based on deep learning of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for classification of OCT images of the retina. To compare the results of computational experiments conducted using Python tools in the Google Colaboratory with single-model and multi-model approaches and evaluate classification accuracy. To make conclusions about the optimal architecture of ANN models and the values of the hyperparameters used.\r\nMaterials and methods. The original dataset, which was anonymized OCT images of real patients, included more than 2000 images obtained directly from the device in a resolution of 1920 × 969 × 24 BPP. The number of image classes is 12. To create the training and validation data sets, a subject area of 1100 × 550 × 24 BPP was “cut out.” Various approaches were studied: the possibility of using pretrained CNNs with transfer learning, techniques for resizing and augmenting images, as well as various combinations of hyperparameters of ANN-models. When compiling the model, the following parameters were used: Adam optimizer, categorical_crossentropy loss function, accuracy metric. All technological processes with images and ANN-models were carried out using Python language tools in Google Colaboratory.\r\nResults. Single-model and multi-model principles for classifying OCT images of the retina are proposed. Computational experiments on automated classification of such images obtained from a DRI OCT Triton 3D tomograph using various ANN model architectures showed an accuracy of 98-100% during training and validation and 85% during an additional test, which is a satisfactory result. The optimal architecture of the ANN model - a six-layer convolutional network - was selected and the values of its hyperparameters were determined.\r\nConclusions. The results of deep training of convolutional neural network models with various architectures, their validation and testing showed satisfactory classification accuracy of retinal OCT images. These developments can be used in decision support systems in the field of ophthalmology.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health challenge that requires timely detection and accurate prognosis for effective treatment and management. The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms for CKD detection and prediction holds promising potential for improving patient outcomes. By incorporating key features which contribute to CKD, these algorithms enhance our ability to identify high-risk individuals and initiate timely interventions. This research highlights the importance of leveraging machine learning techniques to augment existing medical knowledge and improve the identification and management of kidney disease. In this paper, we explore the utilization of diverse ML algorithms, including gradient boost (GB), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), histogram boost (HB), and XGBoost (XGB) to detect and predict chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim is to improve early detection and prognosis, enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. We evaluated the performance of the ML algorithms using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, we conducted feature significance analysis to identify the most influential characteristics in the detection and prediction of kidney disease. The dataset used for training and evaluation contained various clinical and demographic attributes of patients, including serum creatinine level, blood pressure, and age, among others. The proficiency analysis of the ML algorithms revealed consistent predictors across all models, with serum creatinine level, blood pressure, and age emerging as particularly effective in identifying individuals at risk of kidney disease. These findings align with established medical knowledge and emphasize the pivotal role of these attributes in early detection and prognosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of diverse machine learning algorithms in detecting and predicting kidney disease. The identification of influential predictors, such as serum creatinine level, blood pressure, and age, underscores their significance in early detection and prognosis. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of kidney disease diagnosis and treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare system effectiveness.",

This study is aimed at reviewing and evaluating the studies related to the prediction model to identify the risks of pressure injuries in adult hospitalized patients using machine learning algorithms. In addition, it provides evidence that the prediction models identified the risks of pressure injuries earlier. The systematic review has been utilized to review the articles that discussed constructing a prediction model of pressure injuries using machine learning in hospitalized adult patients. The search was conducted in the databases Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHIL), PubMed, Science Direct, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria included studies constructing a prediction model for adult hospitalized patients. Twenty-seven articles were included in the study. The defects in the current method of identifying risks of pressure injury led health scientists and nursing leaders to look for a new methodology that helps identify all risk factors and predict pressure injury earlier, before the skin changes or harms the patients. The paper critically analyzes the current prediction models and guides future directions and motivations.",

The predictive power of many machine learning models—such as multi-linear regression (MLR), artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) and Random Forest classifier—is investigated in this study using data from 2207 patients. The dataset was reduced from the initial dataset of thirty-two criteria samples to fifteen. Assessment measures such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and adjusted correlation coefficient R were used. ANFIS, Random Forest, MLR, and ANN are among the models. After training, ANN outperforms ANFIS (97%), MLR (92%), and Random Forest (68%) with the greatest R (99%) and R2 (99%), respectively. The testing stage confirms the superiority of ANN. The paper also presents a statistical forecasting sheet with few errors and excellent accuracy for MLR models. When the models are assessed with Random Forest, the latter shows the least results, thus broadening the modeling techniques and offering significant insights into the prediction of malaria and healthcare decision making.

The dataset was obtained from NCBI preprocessed graph representations and converted into a structured form. Seven well-known Machine Learning frameworks, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor, were used. Grid Search was employed for hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the Machine Learning models was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, fscore, kappa, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, Mc Nemar’s test was conducted to assess the statistical significance of the experiment. The data was constructed using k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model overperformed over other models with 67.24%, 74.63% and 76.47% accuracy for k-mer lengths of 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The LightGBM model also demonstrated the best performance in each metric. The study showed promising results predicting disease from raw sequence data.

        "abstract": "AbstractHeart attack is a life‐threatening condition which is mostly caused due to coronary disease resulting in death in human beings. Detecting the risk of heart diseases is one of the most important problems in medical science that can be prevented and treated with early detection and appropriate medical management; it can also help to predict a large number of medical needs and reduce expenses for treatment. Predicting the occurrence of heart diseases by machine learning (ML) algorithms has become significant work in healthcare industry. This study aims to create a such system that is used for predicting whether a patient is likely to develop heart attacks, by analysing various data sources including electronic health records and clinical diagnosis reports from hospital clinics. ML is used as a process in which computers learn from data in order to make predictions about new datasets. The algorithms created for predictive data analysis are often used for commercial purposes. This paper presents an overview to forecast the likelihood of a heart attack for which many ML methodologies and techniques are applied. In order to improve medical diagnosis, the paper compares various algorithms such as Random Forest, Regression models, K‐nearest neighbour imputation (KNN), Naïve Bayes algorithm etc. It is found that the Random Forest algorithm provides a better accuracy of 88.52% in forecasting heart attack risk, which could herald a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular illnesses.",

        "abstract": "In forensics, predicting the sex is a crucial step in identification. Many studies have aimed to find an accurate and fast technique to estimate the sex. This study was conducted to determine the accuracy of volumetric and linear measurements of three-dimensional (3D) images of the mandible obtained from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) radiographs, using different machine-learning (ML) models for sex identification. The CBCTs of 104 males and 104 females were included in this study. The radiographs were converted to 3D images, and the volume, surface area, and ten linear measurements of the mandible were obtained. The data were evaluated using statistical analysis and five different ML algorithms. All results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05, and the precision, recall, f1-score, training accuracy, and testing accuracy were used to evaluate the performance of the ML models. All the studied parameters showed statistically significant differences between sexes p < 0.05. The right coronoid-to-gonion linear distance had the highest discriminative power of all the parameters. Meanwhile, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) showed the best performance among all the ML models. The results of this study revealed promising outcomes; the sex can be easily determined, with high accuracy (90%).",

        "abstract": "Graph machine-learning (ML) methods have recently attracted great attention and have made significant progress in graph applications. To date, most graph ML approaches have been evaluated on social networks, but they have not been comprehensively reviewed in the health informatics domain. Herein, a review of graph ML methods and their applications in the disease prediction domain based on electronic health data is presented in this study from two levels: node classification and link prediction. Commonly used graph ML approaches for these two levels are shallow embedding and graph neural networks (GNN). This study performs comprehensive research to identify articles that applied or proposed graph ML models on disease prediction using electronic health data. We considered journals and conferences from four digital library databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, ACM digital library, and IEEEXplore). Based on the identified articles, we review the present status of and trends in graph ML approaches for disease prediction using electronic health data. Even though GNN-based models have achieved outstanding results compared with the traditional ML methods in a wide range of disease prediction tasks, they still confront interpretability and dynamic graph challenges. Though the disease prediction field using ML techniques is still emerging, GNN-based models have the potential to be an excellent approach for disease prediction, which can be used in medical diagnosis, treatment, and the prognosis of diseases.",

        "abstract": "Healthy lifestyle is one of the most important factors in the prevention of premature deaths, chronic diseases, productivity loss, obesity, and other economic and social aspects. The workplace plays an important role in promoting the physical activity and wellbeing of employees. Previous studies are mostly focused on individual interviews, various questionnaires that are a conceptual information about individual health state and might change according to question formulation, specialist competence, and other aspects. In this paper the work ability was mostly related to the employee’s physiological state, which consists of three separate systems: cardiovascular, muscular, and neural. Each state consists of several exercises or tests that need to be performed one after another. The proposed data transformation uses fuzzy logic and different membership functions with three or five thresholds, according to the analyzed physiological feature. The transformed datasets are then classified into three stages that correspond to good, moderate, and poor health condition using machine learning techniques. A three-part Random Forest method was applied, where each part corresponds to a separate system. The obtained testing accuracies were 93%, 87%, and 73% for cardiovascular, muscular, and neural human body systems, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed work ability evaluation process may become a good tool for the prevention of possible accidents at work, chronic fatigue, or other health problems.",

Objective: Utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), we acquired multi-chamber volumetrics and strain feature tracking for a support vector machine learning (SVM)-based diagnostic approach to CS. Method: Forty-five CMR-negative (CMR(−), 56.5(53.0;63.0)years), eighteen CMR-positive (CMR(+), 64.0(57.8;67.0)years) sarcoidosis patients and forty-four controls (CTRL, 56.5(53.0;63.0)years)) underwent CMR examination. Cardiac parameters were processed using the classifiers of logistic regression, KNN(K-nearest-neighbor), DT (decision tree), RF (random forest), SVM, GBoost, XGBoost, Voting and feature selection. Results: In a three-cluster analysis of CTRL versus vs. CMR(+) vs. CMR(−), RF and Voting classifier yielded the highest prediction rates (81.82%). The two-cluster analysis of CTRL vs. all sarcoidosis (All Sarc.) yielded high prediction rates with the classifiers logistic regression, RF and SVM (96.97%), and low prediction rates for the analysis of CMR(+) vs. CMR(−), which were augmented using feature selection with logistic regression (89.47%). Conclusion: Multi-chamber cardiac function and strain-based supervised machine learning provides a non-contrast approach to accurately differentiate between healthy individuals and sarcoidosis patients. Feature selection overcomes the algorithmically challenging discrimination between CMR(+) and CMR(−) patients, yielding high accuracy predictions. The study findings imply higher prevalence of cardiac involvement than previously anticipated, which may impact clinical disease management.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare fraud is intentionally submitting false claims or producing misinterpretation of facts to obtain entitlement payments. Thus, it wastes healthcare financial resources and increases healthcare costs. Subsequently, fraud poses a substantial financial challenge. Therefore, supervised machine and deep learning analytics such as random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks are successfully used to detect healthcare insurance fraud. This study aims to develop a health model that automatically detects fraud from health insurance claims in Saudi Arabia. The model indicates the greatest contributing factor to fraud with optimal accuracy. The labeled imbalanced dataset used three supervised deep and machine learning methods. The dataset was obtained from three healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The applied models were random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. The SMOT technique was used to balance the dataset. Boruta object feature selection was applied to exclude insignificant features. Validation metrics were accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). Random forest classifiers indicated policy type, education, and age as the most significant features with an accuracy of 98.21%, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, an F1 score of 99.03%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 90.00%. Logistic regression resulted in an accuracy of 80.36%, 97.62% precision, 80.39% recall, an F1 score of 88.17%, specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 80.20%. ANN revealed an accuracy of 94.64%, 98.00% precision, 96.08% recall, an F1 score of 97.03%, a specificity of 80%, and an AUC of 88.04%. This predictive analytics study applied three successful models, each of which yielded acceptable accuracy and validation metrics; however, further research on a larger dataset is advised.",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer is a common cause of female mortality in developing countries. Early detection and treatment are crucial for successful outcomes. Breast cancer develops from breast cells and is considered a leading cause of death in women. This disease is classified into two subtypes: invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have made it possible to develop more accurate and reliable models for diagnosing and treating this disease. From the literature, it is evident that the incorporation of MRI and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is helpful in breast cancer detection and prevention. In addition, the detection strategies have shown promise in identifying cancerous cells. The CNN Improvements for Breast Cancer Classification (CNNI-BCC) model helps doctors spot breast cancer using a trained deep learning neural network system to categorize breast cancer subtypes. However, they require significant computing power for imaging methods and preprocessing. Therefore, in this research, we proposed an efficient deep learning model that is capable of recognizing breast cancer in computerized mammograms of varying densities. Our research relied on three distinct modules for feature selection: the removal of low-variance features, univariate feature selection, and recursive feature elimination. The craniocaudally and medial-lateral views of mammograms are incorporated. We tested it with a large dataset of 3002 merged pictures gathered from 1501 individuals who had digital mammography performed between February 2007 and May 2015. In this paper, we applied six different categorization models for the diagnosis of breast cancer, including the random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), and linear support vector classifier (linear SVC). The simulation results prove that our proposed model is highly efficient, as it requires less computational power and is highly accurate.",

        "abstract": "Stress management systems are essential to identify and address stress levels that can disrupt our socioeconomic functioning. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people experience stress, which can result in mental and socioeconomic issues, poor work relationships, and depression, and in severe cases, suicide. Counselling is crucial to help people cope with stress, and while stress cannot be avoided, preventive measures can be taken to mitigate its effects. Currently, only medical and physiological experts can determine whether someone is experiencing stress. Traditional stress detection methods rely on self-reported answers, which can be unreliable. Automated stress detection can minimize health risks and improve societal welfare. Therefore, there is a need for a scientific tool that can automate stress detection using physiological signals. Stress detection is an important social contribution that potential to improve quality of life. As IT industries bring new technologies and products to the market, stress levels in employees are also increasing. While some organizations offer mental health services to their employees, more needs to be done to address this issue.\n\nKeywords: Machine Learning, Stress Detection, Haar cascade algorithm, Convolutional Neural Network",

        "abstract": "Breast cancer (BRCA) has an undesirable prognosis and is the second most common cancer among women after lung cancer. A novel mechanism of programmed cell death called cuproptosis is linked to the development and spread of tumor cells. However, the function of cuproptosis in BRCA remains unknown. To this date, no studies have used machine learning methods to screen for characteristic genes to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in breast cancer. Therefore, 14 cuproptosis-related characteristic genes (CRCGs) were discovered by the feature selection of 39 differentially expressed CRGs using the three machine learning methods LASSO, SVM-RFE, and random forest. Through the PPI network and immune infiltration analysis, we found that PRNP was the key CRCG. The miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB databases were then used to identify hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p as the upstream miRNA of PRNP, and the upstream lncRNA, CARMN, was identified by the StarBase database. Thus, the mRNA PRNP/miRNA hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p/lncRNA CARMN ceRNA network was constructed. This ceRNA network, which has not been studied before, is extremely innovative. Furthermore, four cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLs) were screened in TCGA-BRCA by univariate Cox, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The risk model was constructed by using these four CRLs, and the risk score = C9orf163 * (1.8365) + PHC2-AS1 * (−2.2985) + AC087741.1 * (−0.9504) + AL109824.1 * (0.6016). The ROC curve and C-index demonstrated the superior predictive capacity of the risk model, and the ROC curve demonstrated that the AUC of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in all samples was 0.721, 0.695, and 0.633, respectively. Finally, 50 prospective sensitive medicines were screened with the pRRophetic R package, among which 17-AAG may be a therapeutic agent for high-risk patients, while the other 49 medicines may be suitable for the treatment of low-risk patients. In conclusion, our study constructs a new ceRNA network and a novel risk model, which offer a theoretical foundation for the treatment of BRCA and will aid in improving the prognosis of BRCA.",

Method: A total of 1797 patients who underwent appendectomy with a preliminary diagnosis of AAp between May 2009 and March 2022 were included in the study. Considering the histopathological examination, the patients were divided into two groups as AAp (n = 1465) and non-AAp (NA; n = 332); the non-AAp group is also referred to as negative appendectomy. Subsequently, patients confirmed to have AAp were divided into two subgroups: nonperforated (n = 1161) and perforated AAp (n = 304). The missing values in the data set were assigned using the Random Forest method. The Boruta variable selection method was used to identify the most important variables associated with AAp and perforated AAp. The class imbalance problem in the data set was resolved by the SMOTE method. The CatBoost model was used to classify AAp and non-AAp patients and perforated and nonperforated AAp patients. The performance of the model in the holdout test set was evaluated with accuracy, F1- score, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). The SHAP method, which is one of the XAI methods, was used to interpret the model results. Results: The CatBoost model could distinguish AAp patients from non-AAp individuals with an accuracy of 88.2% (85.6–90.8%), while distinguishing perforated AAp patients from nonperforated AAp individuals with an accuracy of 92% (89.6–94.5%). According to the results of the SHAP method applied to the CatBoost model, it was observed that high total bilirubin, WBC, Netrophil, WLR, NLR, CRP, and WNR values, and low PNR, PDW, and MCV values increased the prediction of AAp biochemically. On the other hand, high CRP, Age, Total Bilirubin, PLT, RDW, WBC, MCV, WLR, NLR, and Neutrophil values, and low Lymphocyte, PDW, MPV, and PNR values were observed to increase the prediction of perforated AAp. Conclusion: For the first time in the literature, a new approach combining ML and XAI methods was tried to predict AAp and perforated AAp, and both clinical conditions were predicted with high accuracy. This new approach proved successful in showing how well which demographic and biochemical parameters could explain the current clinical situation in predicting AAp and perforated AAp.",

The primary objective of these studies is to identify and classify genes involved in the progression of AD and to explore the function of these risk genes in the disease process. The aim of this research is to identify the most effective model for detecting biomarker genes associated with AD using several feature selection methods. We compared the efficiency of feature selection methods with an SVM classifier, including mRMR, CFS, the Chi-Square Test, F-score, and GA. We calculated the accuracy of the SVM classifier using validation methods such as 10-fold cross-validation. We applied these feature selection methods with SVM to a benchmark AD gene expression dataset consisting of 696 samples and 200 genes. The results indicate that the mRMR and F-score feature selection methods with SVM classifier achieved a high accuracy of around 84%, with a number of genes between 20 and 40. Furthermore, the mRMR and F-score feature selection methods with SVM classifier outperformed the GA, Chi-Square Test, and CFS methods. Overall, these findings suggest that the mRMR and F-score feature selection methods with SVM classifier are effective in identifying biomarker genes related to AD and could potentially lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different machine learning methods and traditional multiple logistic regression in predicting c-IMT using baseline features and to establish the most significant risk factors in a T2D cohort. We followed up with 924 patients with T2D for four years, with 75% of the participants used for model development. Machine learning methods, including classification and regression tree, random forest, eXtreme gradient boosting, and Naïve Bayes classifier, were used to predict c-IMT. The results showed that all machine learning methods, except for classification and regression tree, were not inferior to multiple logistic regression in predicting c-IMT in terms of higher area under receiver operation curve. The most significant risk factors for c-IMT were age, sex, creatinine, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, and duration of diabetes, sequentially. Conclusively, machine learning methods could improve the prediction of c-IMT in T2D patients compared to conventional logistic regression models. This could have crucial implications for the early identification and management of cardiovascular disease in T2D patients.",

        "abstract": "This research is aimed to escalate Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) functioning in order to ensure the veracity of existing time-series modeling. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global threat for the past three years. Therefore, advanced forecasting of confirmed infection cases is extremely essential to alleviate the crisis brought out by COVID-19. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-reptile search algorithm (ANFIS-RSA) is developed to effectively anticipate COVID-19 cases. The proposed model integrates a machine-learning model (ANFIS) with a nature-inspired Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA). The RSA technique is used to modulate the parameters in order to improve the ANFIS modeling. Since the performance of the ANFIS model is dependent on optimizing parameters, the statistics of infected cases in China and India were employed through data obtained from WHO reports. To ensure the accuracy of our estimations, corresponding error indicators such as RMSE, RMSRE, MAE, and MAPE were evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2). The recommended approach employed on the China dataset was compared with other upgraded ANFIS methods to identify the best error metrics, resulting in an R2 value of 0.9775. ANFIS-CEBAS and Flower Pollination Algorithm and Salp Swarm Algorithm (FPASSA-ANFIS) attained values of 0.9645 and 0.9763, respectively. Furthermore, the ANFIS-RSA technique was used on the India dataset to examine its efficiency and acquired the best R2 value (0.98). Consequently, the suggested technique was found to be more beneficial for high-precision forecasting of COVID-19 on time-series data.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this research is, with the analysis of existing data of thyroid cancer (TC) metabolites, to develop a machine-learning model that can diagnose TC using metabolite biomarkers. Through data mining, pathway analysis, and machine learning (ML), the model was developed. We identified seven metabolic pathways related to TC: Pyrimidine metabolism, Tyrosine metabolism, Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, Arginine biosynthesis, Phenylalanine metabolism, and Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. The ML classifications’ accuracies were confirmed through 10-fold cross validation, and the most accurate classification was 87.30%. The metabolic pathways identified in relation to TC and the changes within such pathways can contribute to more pattern recognition for diagnostics of TC patients and assistance with TC screening. With independent testing, the model’s accuracy for other unique TC metabolites was 92.31%. The results also point to a possibility for the development of using ML methods for TC diagnostics and further applications of ML in general cancer-related metabolite analysis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Fatty liver disease (FLD) is an important risk factor for liver cancer and cardiovascular disease and can lead to significant social and economic burden. However, there is currently no nationwide epidemiological survey for FLD in China, making early FLD screening crucial for the Chinese population. Unfortunately, liver biopsy and abdominal ultrasound, the preferred methods for FLD diagnosis, are not practical for primary medical institutions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop machine learning (ML) models for screening individuals at high risk of FLD, and to provide a new perspective on early FLD diagnosis. Methods: This study included a total of 30,574 individuals between the ages of 18 and 70 who completed abdominal ultrasound and the related clinical examinations. Among them, 3474 individuals were diagnosed with FLD by abdominal ultrasound. We used 11 indicators to build eight classification models to predict FLD. The model prediction ability was evaluated by the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and kappa value. Feature importance analysis was assessed by Shapley value or root mean square error loss after permutations. Results: Among the eight ML models, the prediction accuracy of the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model was highest at 89.77%. By feature importance analysis, we found that the body mass index, triglyceride, and alanine aminotransferase play important roles in FLD prediction. Conclusion: XGBoost improves the efficiency and cost of large-scale FLD screening.",

We aim to predict the ATRX mutation status non-invasively using radiomics-based machine learning models on MRI and to determine which MRI sequence is best suited for this purpose. In this retrospective study, we used MRI images of patients with histologically confirmed glioma, including the sequences T1w without and with the administration of contrast agent, T2w, and the FLAIR. Radiomics features were extracted from the corresponding MRI images by hand-delineated regions of interest. Data partitioning into training data and independent test data was repeated 100 times to avoid random effects. Feature preselection and subsequent model development were performed using Lasso regression. The T2w sequence was found to be the most suitable and the FLAIR sequence the least suitable for predicting ATRX mutations using radiomics-based machine learning models. For the T2w sequence, our seven-feature model developed with Lasso regression achieved a mean AUC of 0.831, a mean accuracy of 0.746, a mean sensitivity of 0.772, and a mean specificity of 0.697. In conclusion, for the prediction of ATRX mutation using radiomics-based machine learning models, the T2w sequence is the most suitable among the commonly used MRI sequences.",

        "abstract": "Mammography is the most preferred method for breast cancer screening. In this study, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were used to improve the image quality of mammography images and to detect suspicious areas. The main contribution of this study is to reveal the optimal combination of various pre-processing algorithms to enable better interpretation and classification of mammography images because pre-processing algorithms significantly affect the accuracy of segmentation and classification methods. In this study, the effect of combinations of different preprocessing methods in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions was investigated. All image processing algorithms used for lesion detection were used in the mini-MIAS database. In the first step, label information and pectoral muscle resulting from the acquisition of mammography images were removed. In the second step, median filter (MF), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and unsharp masking (USM) algorithms with different combinations of the resolution and visibility of images are increased. In the third step, suspicious regions are extracted from the mammograms using the k-means clustering technique. Then, features were extracted from the obtained ROIs. Finally, feature datasets were classified as normal/abnormal, and benign/malign (two class classification) using Machine Learning algorithms. Test performance measures of the classification methods were examined. In both classifications made in the study, lower classification performance values were obtained when the CLAHE algorithm was used alone as a pre-processing method compared to other pre-processing combinations. When the median filter and unsharp masking algorithms are added to the CLAHE algorithm, the performance of the classification methods has increased. In terms of classification success, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks showed the best performance. It was found by comparing the performances of the classification methods that different preprocessing algorithms were effective in detecting the presence of breast lesions and distinguishing benign and malignant.",

        "abstract": "Backgraund. Implantation of recent IOLs allows ophthalmologists to effectively solve the problems of surgical rehabilitation of patients with cataracts. The degree of improving the patient's visual functions is directly dependent on the accuracy of the preoperative calculation of the optical power of IOLs. The most famous formulas to calculate this indicator are SRK II, SRK/T, Hoffer-Q, Holladay II, Haigis, Barrett. All of them work well for an \"average patient\", however, they are not adequate enough at the boundaries of input variables ranges.\r\nAims. To study the possibility of using mathematical models obtained as a result of deep learning of artificial neural networks (ANN models) to generalize data and predict the optical power of modern intraocular lenses.\r\nMaterials and methods. ANN models were trained on large-scale samples, including depersonalized data for patients of ophthalmology clinic. Data provided in 2021 by ophthalmologist K.K. Syrykh, and reflect the results of both preoperative and postoperative observation of patients. The source file used to build the ANN model includes 455 records - 26 columns of input factors and one column for the output factor - calculating IOL (diopters). To conveniently build ANN models, we used a simulator program, previously developed by the authors.\r\nResults. The resulting models, in contrast to the traditionally used formulas, reflect the regional specificity of patients to a much greater extent. They also make it possible to retrain and optimize the structure based on newly received data, which allows taking into account the non-stationarity of the object. A distinctive feature of such ANN models in comparison with the well-known formulas SRK II, SRK/T, Hoffer-Q, Holladay II, Haigis, Barrett, widely used in the surgical cataract treatment in ophthalmology, is their ability to take into account a significant number of recorded input quantities, which makes it possible to reduce the mean relative error in calculating the optical power of IOL from 10–12% to 3.5%.\r\nConclusions. This work shows the fundamental possibility of generalizing a significant amount of empirical data on calculating the optical power of the IOL using training ANN models that have a significantly larger number of input variables than when using traditional formulas and methods. The results obtained allow, in principle, to build an intelligent expert system with a continuous flow of new data from a source and a step-by-step retraining of the ANN model.",

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been diagnostic candidates for multiple diseases. However, their diagnostic value has not yet been fully established in COPD. The purpose of this study was to develop an effective model for the diagnosis of COPD based on circulating miRNAs. We included circulating miRNA expression profiles of two independent cohorts consisting of 63 COPD and 110 normal samples, and then we constructed a miRNA pair-based matrix. Diagnostic models were developed using several machine learning algorithms. The predictive performance of the optimal model was validated in our external cohort. In this study, the diagnostic values of miRNAs based on the expression levels were unsatisfactory. We identified five key miRNA pairs and further developed seven machine learning models. The classifier based on LightGBM was selected as the final model with the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.883 and 0.794 in test and validation datasets, respectively. We also built a web tool to assist diagnosis for clinicians. Enriched signaling pathways indicated the potential biological functions of the model.

        "abstract": "The condition of fetal overgrowth, also known as macrosomia, can cause serious health complications for both the mother and the infant. It is crucial to identify high-risk macrosomia-relevant pregnancies and intervene appropriately. Despite this need, there are several gaps in research related to macrosomia, including limited predictive models, insufficient machine learning applications, ineffective interventions, and inadequate understanding of how to integrate machine learning models into clinical decision-making. To address these gaps, we developed a machine learning-based model that uses maternal characteristics and medical history to predict macrosomia. Three different algorithms, namely logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were used to develop the model. Based on the evaluation metrics, the logistic regression algorithm provided the best results among the three. The logistic regression algorithm was chosen as the final algorithm to predict macrosomia. The hyper parameters of the logistic regression model were tuned using cross-validation to achieve the best possible performance. Our results indicate that machine learning-based models have the potential to improve macrosomia prediction and enable appropriate interventions for high-risk pregnancies, leading to better health outcomes for both mother and fetus. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and addressing research gaps related to macrosomia, we can potentially reduce the health risks associated with this condition and make informed decisions about high-risk pregnancies.",

Work-related exposure assessment, such as lifting loads, is a crucial aspect of this discipline, as it involves the evaluation of physical stressors and their impact on workers’ health and safety, in order to prevent the development of musculoskeletal pathologies. In this study, we explore the feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithms, fed with time- and frequency-domain features extracted from inertial signals (linear acceleration and angular velocity), to automatically and accurately discriminate safe and unsafe postures during weight lifting tasks. The signals were acquired by means of one inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed on the sternums of 15 subjects, and subsequently segmented to extract several time- and frequency-domain features. A supervised dataset, including the extracted features, was used to feed several ML models and to assess their prediction power. Interesting results in terms of evaluation metrics for a binary safe/unsafe posture classification were obtained with the logistic regression algorithm, which outperformed the others, with accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of up to 96% and 99%, respectively. This result indicates the feasibility of the proposed methodology—based on a single inertial sensor and artificial intelligence—to discriminate safe/unsafe postures associated with load lifting activities. Future investigation in a wider study population and using additional lifting scenarios could confirm the potentiality of the proposed methodology, supporting its applicability in the occupational ergonomics field.",

At present, the industry lacks a standard analytical or data-driven solution for survival probability estimation in both space and time. We present a state-of-the-art physics-guided and data-driven model for well survival statistics forecast with an error of less than 5%. The implications include optimized long-term drilling strategy, robust well production diagnostics, and profitable economic decisions.\nPost pressure interference time, τ, the production rate of an unconventional well declines exponentially. Early and accurate estimation of τ is of utmost importance. Using 5000 wells (from Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford) as the training sample, we developed a universal neural network model to estimate the pressure interference time, τ, of a well. The estimated τ is coupled with the physics-based physical scaling curve to estimate the well survival statistics with time. Finally, the well survival statistics is used to calculate the residual production rate and its consequences on future well fracking strategy.\nThe robustness of the neural network model (ANN) is tested on a test set comprising 6000 wells from Barnett, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus. Using initial well production data, and a single ANN model the predicted pressure interference time τ, has an R2 of 0.98. The well survival statistics estimates for the next 10 years in the future achieved an accuracy of 95%, 93%, 96%, and 95% for Barnett, Marcellus, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford respectively. We found that with time τ has decreased for all the plays (Barnett, Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Marcellus). The estimated well survival statistics is shown to have a strong effect on the optimized and profitable drilling strategy.\nWe have used production data and a physics-informed neural network to unlock future production diagnostics with high certainty. The new and robust state-of-the- art hybrid model estimates the future pressure interference time of wells with an accuracy of 98%. The model calculates the future well survival statistics with time with an average accuracy of 95%.

        "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common technique used to diagnose heart diseases. The electrical signals produced by the heart are recorded by chest electrodes and by the extremity electrodes placed on the limbs. Many diseases, such as arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, coronary heart disease, and heart failure, can be diagnosed by examining ECG signals. The interpretation of these signals by experts may take a long time, and there may be differences between expert interpretations. Since technological developments are intertwined with the medical sciences, computer-assisted diagnostic methods have recently come forward. In computer science, machine learning techniques are often preferred for automatic detection. Quantum-based structures have emerged to increase the machine learning algorithm’s speed and classification performance. In this study, a quantum-based machine learning algorithm is applied to classify heart rhythms. The ECG properties were converted to qubit structure using principal component analysis (PCA). The resulting qubits are classified using the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) algorithm. Quantum computer simulation over Qiskit was used for classification studies. Within the scope of experimental studies, comparisons between classical SVM and QSVM were made using different data amounts and qubit numbers. In the results of the analysis, classical SVM achieved 86.96% accuracy, and QSVM achieved 84.64% accuracy. Despite the fact that the entire dataset was not used due to various limitations, these successful performances were achieved. Classification of medical data such as that from ECG has shown that quantum-based machine learning frameworks perform well despite current resource constraints. In this respect, the study includes essential contributions to the use of quantum-based machine learning methods on signal data in medicine.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal diseases are among the main causes of morbidity and a significant contributor to underfive mortality in the world. There is an increase in understanding of the pathophysiology of the diseases and the implementation of different strategies to minimize their burden. However, improvements in outcomes are not adequate. Limited success is due to different factors, including the similarity of symptoms, which can lead to misdiagnosis, and the inability to detect early for timely intervention. In resource-limited countries like Ethiopia, the challenge is more severe. Low access to diagnosis and treatment due to the inadequacy of neonatal health professionals is one of the shortcomings. Due to the shortage of medical facilities, many neonatal health professionals are forced to decide the type of disease only based on interviews. They may not have a complete picture of all variables that have a contributing effect on neonatal disease from the interview. This can make the diagnosis inconclusive and may lead to a misdiagnosis. Machine learning has great potential for early prediction if relevant historical data is available. We have applied a classification stacking model for the following four main neonatal diseases: sepsis, birth asphyxia, necrotizing enter colitis (NEC), and respiratory distress syndrome. These diseases account for 75% of neonatal deaths. The dataset has been obtained from the Asella Comprehensive Hospital. It has been collected between 2018 and 2021. The developed stacking model was compared to three related machine-learning models XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed stacking model outperformed the other models, with an accuracy of 97.04%. We believe that this will contribute to the early detection and accurate diagnosis of neonatal diseases, especially for resource-limited health facilities.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Cervical cancer is present in most cases of squamous cell carcinoma. In most cases, it is the result of an infection with human papillomavirus or adenocarcinoma. This type of cancer is the third most common cancer of the female reproductive organs. The risk groups for cervical cancer are mostly younger women who frequently change partners, have early sexual intercourse, are infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), and who are nicotine addicts. In most cases, the cancer is asymptomatic until it has progressed to the later stages. Cervical cancer screening rates are low, especially in developing countries and in some minority groups. Due to these facts, the introduction of a tentative cervical cancer screening based on a questionnaire can enable more diagnoses of cervical cancer in the initial stages of the disease. Methods: In this research, publicly available cervical cancer data collected on 859 female patients are used. Each sample consists of 36 input attributes and four different outputs Hinselmann, Schiller, cytology, and biopsy. Due to the significant unbalance of the data set, class balancing techniques were used, and these are the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, the ADAptive SYNthetic algorithm (ADASYN), SMOTEEN, random oversampling, and SMOTETOMEK. To obtain the mentioned target outputs, multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are proposed. In this research, multiple classification algorithms such as logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and several naive Bayes methods were used. Results: From the achieved results, it can be seen that the highest performances were achieved if MLP and KNN are used in combination with Random oversampling, SMOTEEN, and SMOTETOMEK. Such an approach has resulted in mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC¯) and mean Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC¯) scores of higher than 0.95, regardless of which diagnostic method was used for output vector construction. Conclusions: According to the presented results, it can be concluded that there is a possibility for the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for the development of a tentative cervical cancer screening method, which is based on a questionnaire and an AI-based algorithm. Furthermore, it can be concluded that by using class balancing techniques, a certain performance boost can be achieved.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading pandemic, and early detection is important to halting the spread of infection. Recently, the outbreak of this virus has severely affected people around the world with increasing death rates. The increased death rates are because of its spreading nature among people, mainly through physical interactions. Therefore, it is very important to control the spreading of the virus and detect people’s symptoms during the initial stages so proper preventive measures can be taken in good time. In response to COVID-19, revolutionary automation such as deep learning, machine learning, image processing, and medical images such as chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) have been developed in this environment. Currently, the coronavirus is identified via an RT-PCR test. Alternative solutions are required due to the lengthy moratorium period and the large number of false-negative estimations. To prevent the spreading of the virus, we propose the Vehicle-based COVID-19 Detection System to reveal the related symptoms of a person in the vehicles. Moreover, deep extreme machine learning is applied. The proposed system uses headaches, flu, fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, tiredness, nasal congestion, diarrhea, breathing difficulty, and pneumonia. The symptoms are considered parameters to reveal the presence of COVID-19 in a person. Our proposed approach in Vehicles will make it easier for governments to perform COVID-19 tests timely in cities. Due to the ambiguous nature of symptoms in humans, we utilize fuzzy modeling for simulation. The suggested COVID-19 detection model achieved an accuracy of more than 90%.",

        "abstract": "Modern technology frequently uses wearable sensors to monitor many aspects of human behavior. Since continuous records of heart rate and activity levels are typically gathered, the data generated by these devices have a lot of promise beyond counting the number of daily steps or calories expended. Due to the patient’s inability to obtain the necessary information to understand their conditions and detect illness, such as depression, objectively, methods for evaluating various mental disorders, such as the Montgomery–Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) and observations, currently require a significant amount of effort on the part of specialists. In this study, a novel dataset was provided, comprising sensor data gathered from depressed patients. The dataset included 32 healthy controls and 23 unipolar and bipolar depressive patients with motor activity recordings. Along with the sensor data collected over several days of continuous measurement for each patient, some demographic information was also offered. The result of the experiment showed that less than 70 of the 100 epochs of the model’s training were completed. The Cohen Kappa score did not even pass 0.1 in the validation set, due to an imbalance in the class distribution, whereas in the second experiment, the majority of scores peaked in about 20 epochs, but because training continued during each epoch, it took much longer for the loss to decline before it fell below 0.1. In the second experiment, the model soon reached an accuracy of 0.991, which is as expected given the outcome of the UMAP dimensionality reduction. In the last experiment, UMAP and neural networks worked together to produce the best outcomes. They used a variety of machine learning classification algorithms, including the nearest neighbors, linear kernel SVM, Gaussian process, and random forest. This paper used the UMAP unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction without the neural network and showed a slightly lower score (QDA). By considering the ratings of the patient’s depressive symptoms that were completed by medical specialists, it is possible to better understand the relationship between depression and motor activity.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning predictive models have the potential to simplify and automate medical imaging diagnostics by lowering the skill threshold for image interpretation. However, this requires predictive models that are generalized to handle subject variability as seen clinically. Here, we highlight methods to improve test accuracy of an image classifier model for shrapnel identification using tissue phantom image sets. Using a previously developed image classifier neural network—termed ShrapML—blind test accuracy was less than 70% and was variable depending on the training/test data setup, as determined by a leave one subject out (LOSO) holdout methodology. Introduction of affine transformations for image augmentation or MixUp methodologies to generate additional training sets improved model performance and overall accuracy improved to 75%. Further improvements were made by aggregating predictions across five LOSO holdouts. This was done by bagging confidences or predictions from all LOSOs or the top-3 LOSO confidence models for each image prediction. Top-3 LOSO confidence bagging performed best, with test accuracy improved to greater than 85% accuracy for two different blind tissue phantoms. This was confirmed by gradient-weighted class activation mapping to highlight that the image classifier was tracking shrapnel in the image sets. Overall, data augmentation and ensemble prediction approaches were suitable for creating more generalized predictive models for ultrasound image analysis, a critical step for real-time diagnostic deployment.",

This study aimed to explore the usefulness of machine learning (ML) methods using detailed apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) analysis to predict patient outcomes and simulate the time limit for MT in AIS. A total of 75 consecutive patients with AIS with complete reperfusion in MT were included; 20% were separated to test data. The threshold ranged from 620 × 10−6 mm2/s to 480 × 10−6 mm2/s with a 20 × 10−6 mm2/s step. The mean, standard deviation, and pixel number of the region of interest were obtained according to the threshold. Simulation data were created by mean measurement value of patients with a modified Rankin score of 3–4. The time limit was simulated from the cross point of the prediction score according to the time to perform reperfusion from imaging. The extra tree classifier accurately predicted the outcome (AUC: 0.833. Accuracy: 0.933). In simulation data, the prediction score to obtain a good outcome decreased according to increasing time to reperfusion, and the time limit was longer among younger patients. ML methods using detailed ADC analysis accurately predicted patient outcomes in AIS and simulated tolerance time for MT.",

        "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a well-known age-related disease that can lead to musculoskeletal disorders and chronic metabolic syndromes, such as sarcopenic obesity. Numerous studies have researched the relationship between sarcopenia and various risk factors, leading to the development of predictive models based on these factors. In this study, we explored the impact of physical activity (PA) in daily life and obesity on sarcopenia prediction. PA is easier to measure using personal devices, such as smartphones and watches, or lifelogs, than using other factors that require medical equipment and examination. To demonstrate the feasibility of sarcopenia prediction using PA, we trained various machine learning models, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), xgboost (XGB), lightgbm (LGB), catboost (CAT), logistic regression, support vector classifier, k-nearest neighbors, random forest (RF), multi-layer perceptron, and deep neural network (DNN), using data samples from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among the models, the DNN achieved the most precise accuracy on average, 81%, with PA features across all data combinations, and the accuracy increased up to 90% with the addition of obesity information, such as total fat mass and fat percentage. Considering the difficulty of measuring the obesity feature, when adding waist circumference to the PA features, the DNN recorded the highest accuracy of 84%. This model accuracy could be improved by using separate training sets according to gender. As a result of measurement with various metrics for accurate evaluation of models, GBM, XGB, LGB, CAT, RF, and DNN demonstrated significant predictive performance using only PA features including waist circumference, with AUC values at least around 0.85 and often approaching or exceeding 0.9. We also found the key features for a highly performing model such as the quantified PA value and metabolic equivalent score in addition to a simple obesity measure such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference using SHAP analysis.",

        "abstract": "Background: IntraUterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) is a global public health concern and has major implications for neonatal health. The early diagnosis of this condition is crucial for obtaining positive outcomes for the newborn. In recent years Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are being used to identify risk factors and provide early prediction of IUGR. We performed a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) aimed to evaluate the use and performance of AI/ML models in detecting fetuses at risk of IUGR. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA checklist. We searched for studies in all the principal medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane). To assess the quality of the studies we used the JBI and CASP tools. We performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy, along with the calculation of the pooled principal measures. Results: We included 20 studies reporting the use of AI/ML models for the prediction of IUGR. Out of these, 10 studies were used for the quantitative meta-analysis. The most common input variable to predict IUGR was the fetal heart rate variability (n = 8, 40%), followed by the biochemical or biological markers (n = 5, 25%), DNA profiling data (n = 2, 10%), Doppler indices (n = 3, 15%), MRI data (n = 1, 5%), and physiological, clinical, or socioeconomic data (n = 1, 5%). Overall, we found that AI/ML techniques could be effective in predicting and identifying fetuses at risk for IUGR during pregnancy with the following pooled overall diagnostic performance: sensitivity = 0.84 (95% CI 0.80–0.88), specificity = 0.87 (95% CI 0.83–0.90), positive predictive value = 0.78 (95% CI 0.68–0.86), negative predictive value = 0.91 (95% CI 0.86–0.94) and diagnostic odds ratio = 30.97 (95% CI 19.34–49.59). In detail, the RF-SVM (Random Forest–Support Vector Machine) model (with 97% accuracy) showed the best results in predicting IUGR from FHR parameters derived from CTG. Conclusions: our findings showed that AI/ML could be part of a more accurate and cost-effective screening method for IUGR and be of help in optimizing pregnancy outcomes. However, before the introduction into clinical daily practice, an appropriate algorithmic improvement and refinement is needed, and the importance of quality assessment and uniform diagnostic criteria should be further emphasized.",

        "abstract": "Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose level in a human body. Diabetes should not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like: heart related problems, kidney problem, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affects other organs of human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. To achieve this goal this project work will do early prediction of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for a higher accuracy through applying, Various Machine Learning Techniques. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. In this work, Boosting decision tree model (BDT) is used to predict the diabetes. The proposed model is used boosting algorithm to enhance the perform ace of the model. The accuracy is different for every model when compared to other models. The Result shows that the proposed model achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "The growth of biomedical engineering has made depression diagnosis via electroencephalography (EEG) a trendy issue. The two significant challenges to this application are EEG signals’ complexity and non-stationarity. Additionally, the effects caused by individual variances may hamper the generalization of detection systems. Given the association between EEG signals and particular demographics, such as gender and age, and the influences of these demographic characteristics on the incidence of depression, it would be preferable to include demographic factors during EEG modeling and depression detection. The main objective of this work is to develop an algorithm that can recognize depression patterns by studying EEG data. Following a multiband analysis of such signals, machine learning and deep learning techniques were used to detect depression patients automatically. EEG signal data are collected from the multi-modal open dataset MODMA and employed in studying mental diseases. The EEG dataset contains information from a traditional 128-electrode elastic cap and a cutting-edge wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for widespread applications. In this project, resting EEG readings of 128 channels are considered. According to CNN, training with 25 epoch iterations had a 97% accuracy rate. The patient’s status has to be divided into two basic categories: major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy control. Additional MDD include the following six classes: obsessive-compulsive disorders, addiction disorders, conditions brought on by trauma and stress, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and the anxiety disorders discussed in this paper are a few examples of mental illnesses. According to the study, a natural combination of EEG signals and demographic data is promising for the diagnosis of depression.",

        "abstract": "Heart failure is a devastating disease that has high mortality rates and a negative impact on quality of life. Heart failure patients often experience emergency readmission after an initial episode, often due to inadequate management. A timely diagnosis and treatment of underlying issues can significantly reduce the risk of emergency readmissions. The purpose of this project was to predict emergency readmissions of discharged heart failure patients using classical machine learning (ML) models based on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The dataset used for this study consisted of 166 clinical biomarkers from 2008 patient records. Three feature selection techniques were studied along with 13 classical ML models using five-fold cross-validation. A stacking ML model was trained using the predictions of the three best-performing models for final classification. The stacking ML model provided an accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) of 89.41%, 90.10%, 89.41%, 87.83%, 89.28%, and 0.881, respectively. This indicates the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting emergency readmissions. The healthcare providers can intervene pro-actively to reduce emergency hospital readmission risk and improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcare costs using the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "Background: Accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality is essential for better management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been shown to be effective in predicting clinical outcomes. This study aimed to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality in TBI patients using ML algorithms. Materials and Method: A retrospective study was performed using data from both the trauma registry and electronic medical records among TBI patients admitted to the Hamad Trauma Center in Qatar between June 2016 and May 2021. Thirteen features were selected for four ML models including a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost), to predict the in-hospital mortality. Results: A dataset of 922 patients was analyzed, of which 78% survived and 22% died. The AUC scores for SVM, LR, XgBoost, and RF models were 0.86, 0.84, 0.85, and 0.86, respectively. XgBoost and RF had good AUC scores but exhibited significant differences in log loss between the training and testing sets (% difference in logloss of 79.5 and 41.8, respectively), indicating overfitting compared to the other models. The feature importance trend across all models indicates that aPTT, INR, ISS, prothrombin time, and lactic acid are the most important features in prediction. Magnesium also displayed significant importance in the prediction of mortality among serum electrolytes. Conclusions: SVM was found to be the best-performing ML model in predicting the mortality of TBI patients. It had the highest AUC score and did not show overfitting, making it a more reliable model compared to LR, XgBoost, and RF.",

        "abstract": "This study identified the most accurate model for predicting longitudinal craniofacial growth in a Japanese population using statistical methods and machine learning. Longitudinal lateral cephalometric radiographs were collected from 59 children (27 boys and 32 girls) with no history of orthodontic treatment. Multiple regression analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, radial basis function network, multilayer perceptron, and gradient-boosted decision tree were used. The independent variables included 26 coordinated values of skeletal landmarks, 13 linear skeletal parameters, and 17 angular skeletal parameters in children ages 6 to 12 years. The dependent variables were the values of the 26 coordinated skeletal landmarks, 13 skeletal linear parameters, and 17 skeletal angular parameters at 13 years of age. The difference between the predicted and actual measured values was calculated using the root-mean-square error. The prediction model for craniofacial growth using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator had the smallest average error for all values of skeletal landmarks, linear parameters, and angular parameters. The highest prediction accuracies when predicting skeletal linear and angular parameters for 13-year-olds were 97.87% and 94.45%, respectively. This model incorporates several independent variables and is useful for future orthodontic treatment because it can predict individual growth.",

        "abstract": "Cancer is a problematic global health issue with an extremely high fatality rate throughout the world. The application of various machine learning techniques that have appeared in the field of cancer diagnosis in recent years has provided meaningful insights into efficient and precise treatment decision-making. Due to rapid advancements in sequencing technologies, the detection of cancer based on gene expression data has improved over the years. Different types of cancer affect different parts of the body in different ways. Cancer that affects the mouth, lip, and upper throat is known as oral cancer, which is the sixth most prevalent form of cancer worldwide. India, Bangladesh, China, the United States, and Pakistan are the top five countries with the highest rates of oral cavity disease and lip cancer. The major causes of oral cancer are excessive use of tobacco and cigarette smoking. Many people’s lives can be saved if oral cancer (OC) can be detected early. Early identification and diagnosis could assist doctors in providing better patient care and effective treatment. OC screening may advance with the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. AI can provide assistance to the oncology sector by accurately analyzing a large dataset from several imaging modalities. This review deals with the implementation of AI during the early stages of cancer for the proper detection and treatment of OC. Furthermore, performance evaluations of several DL and ML models have been carried out to show that the DL model can overcome the difficult challenges associated with early cancerous lesions in the mouth. For this review, we have followed the rules recommended for the extension of scoping reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA-ScR). Examining the reference lists for the chosen articles helped us gather more details on the subject. Additionally, we discussed AI’s drawbacks and its potential use in research on oral cancer. There are methods for reducing risk factors, such as reducing the use of tobacco and alcohol, as well as immunization against HPV infection to avoid oral cancer, or to lessen the burden of the disease. Additionally, officious methods for preventing oral diseases include training programs for doctors and patients as well as facilitating early diagnosis via screening high-risk populations for the disease.",

        "abstract": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is one of the primary sources of mortality and morbidity among the global population. Over 26 million individuals globally are affected by heart disease, and its prevalence is rising by 2% yearly. With advances in healthcare technologies, if we predict CHF in the early stages, one of the leading global mortality factors can be reduced. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to use machine learning applications to enhance the diagnosis of CHF and to reduce the cost of diagnosis by employing minimum features to forecast the possibility of a CHF occurring. We employ a deep neural network (DNN) classifier for CHF classification and compare the performance of DNN with various machine learning classifiers. In this research, we use a very challenging dataset, called the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) dataset, and a unique pre-processing technique by integrating C4.5 and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). While the C4.5 technique is used to find significant features and remove the outlier data from the dataset, the KNN algorithm is employed for missing data imputation. For classification, we compare six state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms (KNN, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT)) with DNN. To evaluate the performance, we use seven statistical measurements (i.e., accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, precision, Matthew’s correlation coefficient, and false positive rate). Overall, our results reflect our proposed integrated approach, which outperformed other machine learning algorithms in terms of CHF prediction, reducing patient expenses by reducing the number of medical tests. The proposed model obtained 97.03% F1-score, 95.30% accuracy, 96.49% sensitivity, and 97.58% precision.",

        "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the prevalence of chronic illnesses in humans associated with high blood sugar has dramatically increased. Such a disease is referred to medically as diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus can be categorized into three types, namely types 1, 2, and 3. When beta cells do not secrete enough insulin, type 1 diabetes develops. When beta cells create insulin, but the body is unable to use it, type 2 diabetes results. The last category is called gestational diabetes or type 3. This happens during the trimesters of pregnancy in women. Gestational diabetes, however, disappears automatically after childbirth or may continue to develop into type 2 diabetes. To improve their treatment strategies and facilitate healthcare, an automated information system to diagnose diabetes mellitus is required. In this context, this paper presents a novel system of classification of the three types of diabetes mellitus using a multi-layer neural network no-prop algorithm. The algorithm uses two major phases in the information system: the training phase and the testing phase. In each phase, the relevant attributes are identified using the attribute-selection process, and the neural network is trained individually in a multi-layer manner, starting with normal and type 1 diabetes, then normal and type 2 diabetes, and finally healthy and gestational diabetes. Classification is made more effective by the architecture of the multi-layer neural network. To provide experimental analysis and performances of diabetes diagnoses in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, a confusion matrix is developed. The maximum specificity and sensitivity values of 0.95 and 0.97 are attained by this suggested multi-layer neural network. With an accuracy score of 97% for the categorization of diabetes mellitus, this proposed model outperforms other models, demonstrating that it is a workable and efficient approach.",

The accuracy of the SBR estimation was assessed using the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, correlation coefficient, and slope. The 128FOV dataset had significantly larger absolute errors compared to all other datasets (p < 0. 05). The best correlation coefficient between the SBRs using SPECT images and those estimated from frontal projection images alone was 0.87. Clinical use of the new CNN method in this study was feasible for estimating the SBR with a small error rate using only the frontal projection images collected in a short time.",

Serum biomarkers historically correlate well with the early prognosis of post-surgical complications of PC. However, attempts to identify an effective biomarker panel for the successful prognosis of PC were almost non-existent in the current literature. The current study investigated the roles of various serum biomarkers including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL-8), procalcitonin (PCT), and other relevant clinical data for identifying PC progression, classified into sepsis, recurrence, and other post-surgical complications, among PC patients. The most relevant biochemical and clinical markers for PC prognosis were identified using a random-forest-powered feature elimination method. Using this informative biomarker panel, the selected machine-learning (ML) classification models demonstrated highly accurate results for classifying PC patients into three complication groups on independent test data. The superiority of the combined biomarker panel (Max AUC-ROC = 100%) was further established over using CA19-9 features exclusively (Max AUC-ROC = 75%) for the task of classifying PC progression. This novel study demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined biomarker panel in successfully diagnosing PC progression and other relevant complications among Egyptian PC survivors.",

There was no significant interaction between methods and time points used for predicting the mandibular length (p = 0.235) and Y axis of growth (p = 0.549). All tested ML algorithms accurately predicted the post-pubertal mandibular length and Y axis of growth. The best predictors for the mandibular length were mandibular and maxillary lengths, and lower face height, while they were Y axis of growth, lower face height, and mandibular plane angle for the post-pubertal Y axis of growth. No significant difference was found among the accuracies of the techniques, except the least squares method had a significantly larger error than all others in predicting the Y axis of growth.",

        "abstract": "The procedure to diagnose anemia is time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the existence of a multitude of symptoms that can be felt physically or seen visually. Anemia also has several forms, which can be distinguished based on several characteristics. It is possible to diagnose anemia through a quick, affordable, and easily accessible laboratory test known as the complete blood count (CBC), but the method cannot directly identify different kinds of anemia. Therefore, further tests are required to establish a gold standard for the type of anemia in a patient. These tests are uncommon in settings that offer healthcare on a smaller scale because they require expensive equipment. Moreover, it is also difficult to discern between beta thalassemia trait (BTT), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), hemoglobin E (HbE), and combination anemias despite the presence of multiple red blood cell (RBC) formulas and indices with differing optimal cutoff values. This is due to the existence of several varieties of anemia in individuals, making it difficult to distinguish between BTT, IDA, HbE, and combinations. Therefore, a more precise and automated prediction model is proposed to distinguish these four types to accelerate the identification process for doctors. Historical data were retrieved from the Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia for this purpose. Furthermore, the model was developed using the algorithm for the extreme learning machine (ELM). This was followed by the measurement of the performance using the confusion matrix and 190 data representing the four classes, and the results showed 99.21% accuracy, 98.44% sensitivity, 99.30% precision, and an F1 score of 98.84%.",

        "abstract": "  \tDiagnosing battery states such as health, state-of-charge, or temperature is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of electrochemical energy storage systems. While some states, such as temperature, may be measured using cheap sensors, accurate diagnosis of battery health metrics usually requires time-consuming performance measurements, making them infeasible for use in real-world operation. These health metrics can be measured during lab-testing and then estimated on-line using predictive life models or via state observer algorithms such as Kalman filters, but these predictive methods should be supplemented by actual measurement of battery health whenever possible to ensure reliability. Rapid measurement of battery health may be done by various types of fast diagnostic techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which can be performed in only a few minutes and require only a fraction of the energy and power needed for a full charge and discharge measurement. But there is a substantial challenge for estimating battery health using EIS data, as EIS is sensitive to cell temperature, state-of-charge, current, and resting time in addition to health. Thus, utilizing EIS data to predict battery capacity requires correcting for all these additional variables, a task that is extremely difficult to handle analytically.\nThis talk utilizes machine-learning methods to estimate the effectiveness of battery capacity prediction from EIS data, leveraging a data set of hundreds of EIS measurements recorded at varying temperature and state-of-charge throughout a 500-day aging study of 32 commercial, large-format NMC-Graphite lithium-ion batteries. Using EIS as input to machine-learning models is complicated by the nonlinear response of impedance to battery health, temperature, and state-of-charge, as well as the collinearity between the impedance response at neighboring frequencies, which can easily lead to overfit models. To train robust models, features from EIS data need to be extracted from the data or some subset of critical frequencies selected. Many approaches for extracting and selecting features from EIS data from electrochemical analysis and machine-learning fields were identified for analysis: using the entire raw spectra; selection of one, two, or many frequencies from the entire spectra; selecting interesting points from the EIS measurement using domain knowledge; fitting EIS with an equivalent-circuit model; calculating statistics on the raw impedance values; and reducing the dimensionality of the data using unsupervised linear (principal component analysis) and non-linear (uniform manifold approximation and projection) methods. These approaches were rigorously compared using a machine-learning pipeline approach, training linear, Gaussian process, and random forest regression models and quantifying performance using cross-validation as well as a held-out test set. An artificial neural network model trained on the raw spectra was also tested. Promising pipelines were fine-tuned via Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using cross-validation loss and training with class-specific weights to counter data set imbalance.\nThe most reliable method for utilizing impedance in this work was the selection of two optimal frequencies through an exhaustive search, resulting in about 2% mean absolute error on test data for both Gaussian process and random forest model architectures. Interrogation of a variety of models reveals critical frequencies of 100 Hz and 103 Hz for this data set, though the optimal set of frequencies is not necessarily intuitive, i.e., the best performing models are not simply those that use impedance at frequencies that have the highest correlation to the relative discharge capacity. The best performing model is an ensemble model, which is able to predict battery capacity with 1.9% mean absolute error for unseen cells using impedance recorded at a variety of temperatures and states-of-charge.

        "abstract": "Accurately diagnosing schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder, is crucial for effectively managing the treatment process and methods. Various types of magnetic resonance (MR) images have the potential to serve as biomarkers for schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to numerically analyze differences in the textural characteristics that may occur in the bilateral amygdala, caudate, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus regions of the brain between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls via structural MR images. Towards this aim, Gray Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM) features obtained from five regions of the right, left, and bilateral brain were classified using machine learning methods. In addition, it was analyzed in which hemisphere these features were more distinctive and which method among Adaboost, Gradient Boost, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes had higher classification success. When the results were examined, it was demonstrated that the GLCM features of these five regions in the left hemisphere could be classified as having higher performance in schizophrenia compared to healthy individuals. Using the LDA algorithm, classification success was achieved with a 100% AUC, 94.4% accuracy, 92.31% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an F1 score of 91.9% in healthy and schizophrenic individuals. Thus, it has been revealed that the textural characteristics of the five predetermined regions, instead of the whole brain, are an important indicator in identifying schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore how machine learning technologies can improve healthcare operations management. A machine learning-based model to solve a specific medical problem is developed to achieve this research purpose. Specifically, this study presents an AI solution for malaria infection diagnosis by applying the CNN (convolutional neural network) algorithm. Based on malaria microscopy image data from the NIH National Library of Medicine, a total of 24,958 images were used for deep learning training, and 2600 images were selected for final testing of the proposed diagnostic architecture. The empirical results indicate that the CNN diagnostic model correctly classified most malaria-infected and non-infected cases with minimal misclassification, with performance metrics of precision (0.97), recall (0.99), and f1-score (0.98) for uninfected cells, and precision (0.99), recall (0.97), and f1-score (0.98) for parasite cells. The CNN diagnostic solution rapidly processed a large number of cases with a high reliable accuracy of 97.81%. The performance of this CNN model was further validated through the k-fold cross-validation test. These results suggest the advantage of machine learning-based diagnostic methods over conventional manual diagnostic methods in improving healthcare operational capabilities in terms of diagnostic quality, processing costs, lead time, and productivity. In addition, a machine learning diagnosis system is more likely to enhance the financial profitability of healthcare operations by reducing the risk of unnecessary medical disputes related to diagnostic errors. As an extension for future research, propositions with a research framework are presented to examine the impacts of machine learning on healthcare operations management for safety and quality of life in global communities.",

The present study applied different machine learning algorithms on multiple patient characteristics to predict uncontrolled diabetes. Patients with diabetes above the age of 18 from the All of Us Research Program were included. Random forest, extreme gradient boost, logistic regression, and weighted ensemble model algorithms were employed. Patients who had a record of uncontrolled diabetes based on the international classification of diseases code were identified as cases. A set of features including basic demographic, biomarkers and hematological indices were included in the model. The random forest model demonstrated high performance in predicting uncontrolled diabetes, yielding an accuracy of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79–0.81) as compared to the extreme gradient boost 0.74 (95% CI: 0.73–0.75), the logistic regression 0.64 (95% CI: 0.63–0.65) and the weighted ensemble model 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76–0.79). The maximum area under the receiver characteristics curve value was 0.77 (random forest model), while the minimum value was 0.7 (logistic regression model). Potassium levels, body weight, aspartate aminotransferase, height, and heart rate were important predictors of uncontrolled diabetes. The random forest model demonstrated a high performance in predicting uncontrolled diabetes. Serum electrolytes and physical measurements were important features in predicting uncontrolled diabetes. Machine learning techniques may be used to predict uncontrolled diabetes by incorporating these clinical characteristics.",

The ear muscles are affected by synkinetic EMG activity in patients with postparalytic facial synkinesis (PFS). The aim of the present work was to establish a machine-learning-based algorithm to detect eyelid closure and smiling in patients with PFS by recording sEMG using surface electromyography of the auricular muscles. Sixteen patients (10 female, 6 male) with PFS were included. EMG acquisition of the anterior auricular muscle, superior auricular muscle, posterior auricular muscle, tragicus muscle, orbicularis oculi muscle, and orbicularis oris muscle was performed on both sides of the face during standardized eye closure and smiling tasks. Machine-learning EMG classification with a support vector machine allowed for the reliable detection of eye closure or smiling from the ear muscle recordings with clear distinction to other mimic expressions. These results show that the EMG of the auricular muscles in patients with PFS may contain enough information to detect facial expressions to trigger a future implant in a closed-loop system for electrostimulation to improve insufficient eye closure and smiling in patients with PFS.",

This study aims to predict ruptured intracranial aneurysms by radiomics models based on different machine learning algorithms and evaluate their differences in the same data condition. A total of 576 patients with intracranial aneurysms (192 ruptured and 384 unruptured intracranial aneurysms) from two institutions are included and randomly divided into training and validation cohorts in a ratio of 7:3. Of the 107 radiomics features extracted from computed tomography angiography images, seven features stood out. Then, radiomics features and 12 common machine learning algorithms, including the decision-making tree, support vector machine, logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, bagging classifier, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and CatBoost were applied to construct models for predicting ruptured intracranial aneurysms, and the predictive performance of all models was compared. In the validation cohort, the area under curve (AUC) values of models based on AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and CatBoost for predicting ruptured intracranial aneurysms were 0.889, 0.883, and 0.864, respectively, with no significant differences among them. Of note, the performance of these models was significantly superior to that of the other nine models. The AUC of the AdaBoost model in the cross-validation was within the range of 0.842 to 0.918. Radiomics models based on the machine learning algorithms can be used to predict ruptured intracranial aneurysms, and the prediction efficacy differs among machine learning algorithms. The boosting algorithms might be superior in the application of radiomics combined with the machine learning algorithm to predict aneurysm ruptures.",

        "abstract": "Influenza has been a stationary disease in Mexico since 2009, and this causes a high cost for the national public health system, including its detection using RT-qPCR tests, treatments, and absenteeism in the workplace. Despite influenza’s relevance, the main clinical features to detect the disease defined by international institutions like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) do not follow the same pattern in all populations. The aim of this work is to find a machine learning method to facilitate decision making in the clinical differentiation between positive and negative influenza patients, based on their symptoms and demographic features. The research sample consisted of 15480 records, including clinical and demographic data of patients with a positive/negative RT-qPCR influenza tests, from 2010 to 2020 in the public healthcare institutions of Mexico City. The performance of the methods for classifying influenza cases were evaluated with indices like accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, the f1-measure and the area under the curve (AUC). Results indicate that random forest and bagging classifiers were the best supervised methods; they showed promise in supporting clinical diagnosis, especially in places where performing molecular tests might be challenging or not feasible.",

        "abstract": "Although the association between risk factors and non-surgical root canal treatment (NSRCT) failure has been extensively studied, methods to predict the outcomes of NSRCT are in an early stage, and dentists currently make the treatment prognosis based mainly on their clinical experience. Since this involves different sources of error, we investigated the use of machine learning (ML) models as a second opinion to support the clinical decision on whether to perform NSRCT. We undertook a retrospective study of 119 confirmed and not previously treated Apical Periodontitis cases that received the same treatment by the same specialist. For each patient, we recorded the variables from a newly proposed data collection template and defined a binary outcome: Success if the lesion clears and failure otherwise. We conducted tests for detecting the association between the variables and the outcome and selected a set of variables as the initial inputs into four ML algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Naive-Bayes (NB), and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). According to our results, RF and KNN significantly improve (p-values < 0.05) the sensitivity and accuracy of the dentist’s treatment prognosis. Taking our results as a proof of concept, we conclude that future randomized clinical trials are worth designing to test the clinical utility of ML models as a second opinion for NSRCT prognosis.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease whose diagnosis depends on the presence of combined lower motor neuron (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration. LMN degeneration assessment is aided by electromyography, whereas no equivalent exists to assess UMN dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is primarily used to exclude conditions that mimic ALS. We have identified four different clinical/radiological phenotypes of ALS patients. We hypothesize that these ALS phenotypes arise from distinct pathologic processes that result in unique MRI signatures. To our knowledge, no machine learning (ML)-based data analyses have been performed to stratify different ALS phenotypes using MRI measures. During routine clinical evaluation, we obtained T1-, T2-, PD-weighted, diffusion tensor (DT) brain MRI of 15 neurological controls and 91 ALS patients (UMN-predominant ALS with corticospinal tract CST) hyperintensity, n = 21; UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, n = 26; classic ALS, n = 23; and ALS patients with frontotemporal dementia, n = 21). From these images, we obtained 101 white matter (WM) attributes (including DT measures, graph theory measures from DT and fractal dimension (FD) measures using T1-weighted), 10 grey matter (GM) attributes (including FD based measures from T1-weighted), and 10 non-imaging attributes (2 demographic and 8 clinical measures of ALS). We employed classification and regression tree, Random Forest (RF) and also artificial neural network for the classifications. RF algorithm provided the best accuracy (70–94%) in classifying four different phenotypes of ALS patients. WM metrics played a dominant role in classifying different phenotypes when compared to GM or clinical measures. Although WM measures from both right and left hemispheres need to be considered to identify ALS phenotypes, they appear to be differentially affected by the degenerative process. Longitudinal studies can confirm and extend our findings.",

Whether modern modeling techniques such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning are of value for finer distinction of subtypes such as IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) is not known. We determined the antibody profile of 100 adult IBD patients from the Swiss IBD cohort study with known subtype (50 CD, 50 UC) as well as of 76 IBD-U patients. We included ASCA IgG and IgA, p-ANCA, MPO- and PR3-ANCA, and xANCA measurements for computing different antibody panels as well as machine learning models. The AUC of an optimized antibody panel was 85% (95%CI, 78–92%) to distinguish CD from UC patients. The antibody profile of IBD-U patients was closely related to UC. No specific antibody profile was predictive for IBD-U nor for re-classification. The panel diagnostic was in favor of UC reclassification prediction with a correct assignment rate of 69.2–73.1% depending on the cut-off applied. Supervised machine learning could not distinguish between CD, UC, and IBD-U. More so, unsupervised machine learning suggested only two distinct clusters as a likely number of IBD subtypes. Antibodies in IBD are supportive in confirming clinical determined subtypes CD and UC but have limited capacity to predict IBD-U and reclassification during follow-up. In terms of antibody profiles, IBD-U is not a distinct subtype of IBD.",

While the need for surgery and even its type is often obvious to a patient, the need for chemotherapy and radiation therapy is not as obvious to the patient. With this in mind, the following treatment plans were considered in this study: chemotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy with radiation, and none of these options (only surgery). We use real data from more than 10,000 patients over 6 years that includes detailed cancer information, treatment plans, and survival statistics. Using this data set, we construct Machine Learning classifiers to suggest treatment plans. Our emphasis in this effort is not only on suggesting the treatment plan but on explaining and defending a particular treatment choice to the patient.",

Conventional diagnosis of the disease is based on microscopic examination of thick blood smears. This analysis can be time-consuming, which is key to generate prevention strategies and adequate treatment to avoid the complications associated with the disease. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning-based approach to detect not only malaria parasites but also leukocytes to perform parasite/μL blood count. We used positive and negative images with parasites and leukocytes. We performed data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset. The YOLOv8 algorithm was used for model training and using the counting formula the parasites were counted. The results showed the ability of the model to detect parasites and leukocytes with 95% and 98% accuracy, respectively. The time spent by the model to report parasitemia is significantly less than the time spent by malaria experts. This type of system would be supportive for areas with poor access to health care. We recommend validation of such approaches on a large scale in health institutions.",

This study employs the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance issues in the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses dataset and predict nurse turnover using machine learning algorithms. Four machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forests, decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting, were applied to the SMOTE-enhanced dataset. The data were split into 80% training and 20% validation sets. Eighteen carefully selected variables from the database served as predictive features, and the machine learning model identified age, working hours, electric health record/electronic medical record, individual income, and job type as important features concerning nurse turnover. The study includes a performance comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), F1-score, and AUC. In summary, the results demonstrate that SMOTE-enhanced random forests exhibit the most robust predictive power in the classical approach (with all 18 predictive variables) and an optimized approach (utilizing eight key predictive variables). Extreme gradient boosting, decision tree, and logistic regression follow in performance. Notably, age emerges as the most influential factor in nurse turnover, with working hours, electric health record/electronic medical record usability, individual income, and region also playing significant roles. This research offers valuable insights for healthcare researchers and stakeholders, aiding in selecting suitable machine learning algorithms for nurse turnover prediction.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is heavily reliant on rice production, but a staggering annual decline of 37% in rice output due to insufficient knowledge in recognizing and managing rice plant diseases has raised concerns. As a result, there is a pressing need for a system that can accurately identify and control rice plant diseases automatically. CNNs have demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting plant diseases, thanks to their exceptional image classification capabilities. Nevertheless, research on rice plant disease identification remains scarce. This study offers a comprehensive overview of rice plant ailments and explores DL techniques used for their detection. By evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of various systems found in the literature, the study aims to identify the most accurate means of detecting and controlling rice plant diseases using DL techniques. We present a real-time detection and diagnostic system for rice lead diseases that utilizes ML methods. This system is designed to identify three prevalent rice plant diseases, specially leaf smut, bacterial leaf blight and brown spot diseases. Clear images of affected rice leaves against a white background serve as input data for the system. To train the dataset, several ML algorithms were employed including KNN, Naive Bayes, J48 and Logistic Regression. Following the pre-processing stage, the decision tree algorithm demonstrated an accurateness of over 97% when claimed to test dataset. In conclusion, implementing an automated system that leverages ML techniques is vital for reducing the time and labor required for detecting and managing rice plant diseases. Such a system would contribute significantly to ensuring the healthy growth of rice plants in Bangladesh, ultimately boosting the nation’s rice production.",

        "abstract": "Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary endpoint of NAC is a pathological complete response (pCR). NAC results in pCR in only 30–40% of TNBC patients. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Ki67 and phosphohistone H3 (pH3) are a few known biomarkers to predict NAC response. Currently, systematic evaluation of the combined value of these biomarkers in predicting NAC response is lacking. In this study, the predictive value of markers derived from H&E and IHC stained biopsy tissue was comprehensively evaluated using a supervised machine learning (ML)-based approach. Identifying predictive biomarkers could help guide therapeutic decisions by enabling precise stratification of TNBC patients into responders and partial or non-responders. Methods: Serial sections from core needle biopsies (n = 76) were stained with H&E and immunohistochemically for the Ki67 and pH3 markers, followed by whole-slide image (WSI) generation. The serial section stains in H&E stain, Ki67 and pH3 markers formed WSI triplets for each patient. The resulting WSI triplets were co-registered with H&E WSIs serving as the reference. Separate mask region-based CNN (MRCNN) models were trained with annotated H&E, Ki67 and pH3 images for detecting tumor cells, stromal and intratumoral TILs (sTILs and tTILs), Ki67+, and pH3+ cells. Top image patches with a high density of cells of interest were identified as hotspots. Best classifiers for NAC response prediction were identified by training multiple ML models and evaluating their performance by accuracy, area under curve, and confusion matrix analyses. Results: Highest prediction accuracy was achieved when hotspot regions were identified by tTIL counts and each hotspot was represented by measures of tTILs, sTILs, tumor cells, Ki67+, and pH3+ features. Regardless of the hotspot selection metric, a complementary use of multiple histological features (tTILs, sTILs) and molecular biomarkers (Ki67 and pH3) resulted in top ranked performance at the patient level. Conclusions: Overall, our results emphasize that prediction models for NAC response should be based on biomarkers in combination rather than in isolation. Our study provides compelling evidence to support the use of ML-based models to predict NAC response in patients with TNBC.",

        "abstract": "This study uses machine learning to perform the hearing test (audiometry) processes autonomously with EEG signals. Sounds with different amplitudes and wavelengths given to the person tested in standard hearing tests are assigned randomly with the interface designed with MATLAB GUI. The person stated that he heard the random size sounds he listened to with headphones but did not take action if he did not hear them. Simultaneously, EEG (electro-encephalography) signals were followed, and the waves created in the brain by the sounds that the person attended and did not hear were recorded. EEG data generated at the end of the test were pre-processed, and then feature extraction was performed. The heard and unheard information received from the MATLAB interface was combined with the EEG signals, and it was determined which sounds the person heard and which they did not hear. During the waiting period between the sounds given via the interface, no sound was given to the person. Therefore, these times are marked as not heard in EEG signals. In this study, brain signals were measured with Brain Products Vamp 16 EEG device, and then EEG raw data were created using the Brain Vision Recorder program and MATLAB. After the data set was created from the signal data produced by the heard and unheard sounds in the brain, machine learning processes were carried out with the PYTHON programming language. The raw data created with MATLAB was taken with the Python programming language, and after the pre-processing steps were completed, machine learning methods were applied to the classification algorithms. Each raw EEG data has been detected by the Count Vectorizer method. The importance of each EEG signal in all EEG data has been calculated using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. The obtained dataset has been classified according to whether people can hear the sound. Naïve Bayes, Light Gradient Strengthening Machine (LGBM), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, k-NN, logistic regression, and random forest classifier algorithms have been applied in the analysis. The algorithms selected in our study were preferred because they showed superior performance in ML and succeeded in analyzing EEG signals. Selected classification algorithms also have features of being used online. Naïve Bayes, Light Gradient Strengthening Machine (LGBM), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, k-NN, logistic regression, and random forest classifier algorithms were used. In the analysis of EEG signals, Light Gradient Strengthening Machine (LGBM) was obtained as the best method. It was determined that the most successful algorithm in prediction was the prediction of the LGBM classification algorithm, with a success rate of 84%. This study has revealed that hearing tests can also be performed using brain waves detected by an EEG device. Although a completely independent hearing test can be created, an audiologist or doctor may be needed to evaluate the results.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of heart failure can help prevent life-threatening situations. Several factors contribute to the risk of heart failure, including underlying heart diseases such as coronary artery disease or heart attack, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, certain medications, and lifestyle habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake. Machine learning approaches to predict and detect heart disease hold significant potential for clinical utility but face several challenges in their development and implementation. This research proposes a machine learning metamodel for predicting a patient’s heart failure based on clinical test data. The proposed metamodel was developed based on Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree models, and k-Nearest Neighbor as the final estimator. The metamodel is trained and tested utilizing a combined dataset comprising five well-known heart datasets (Statlog Heart, Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, and Long Beach), all sharing 11 standard features. The study shows that the proposed metamodel can predict heart failure more accurately than other machine learning models, with an accuracy of 87%.",

        "abstract": "The brain is an intrinsic and complicated component of human anatomy. It is a collection of connective tissues and nerve cells that regulate the principal actions of the entire body. Brain tumor cancer is a serious mortality factor and a highly intractable disease. Even though brain tumors are not considered a fundamental cause of cancer deaths worldwide, about 40% of other cancer types are metastasized to the brain and transform into brain tumors. Computer-aided devices for diagnosis through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have remained the gold standard for the diagnosis of brain tumors, but this conventional method has been greatly challenged with inefficiencies and drawbacks related to the late detection of brain tumors, high risk in biopsy procedures, and low specificity. To circumvent these underlying hurdles, machine learning models have recently been developed to enhance computer-aided diagnosis tools for advanced, precise, and automatic early detection of brain tumors. This study takes a novel approach to evaluate machine learning models (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient-boosting model (GBM), convolutional neural network (CNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), AlexNet, GoogLeNet, CNN VGG19, and CapsNet) used for the early detection and classification of brain tumors by deploying the multicriteria decision-making method called fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE), based on selected parameters, in this study: prediction accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, processing time, and sensitivity. To validate the results of our proposed approach, we performed a sensitivity analysis and cross-checking analysis with the PROMETHEE model. The CNN model, with an outranking net flow of 0.0251, is considered the most favorable model for the early detection of brain tumors. The KNN model, with a net flow of −0.0154, is the least appealing option. The findings of this study support the applicability of the proposed approach for making optimal choices regarding the selection of machine learning models. The decision maker is thus afforded the opportunity to expand the range of considerations which they must rely on in selecting the preferred models for early detection of brain tumors.",

In the domain of health care, there is a rapid development of intelligent systems for analyzing complicated data relationships and transforming them into real information for use in the prediction process. Consequently, artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the healthcare industry, and thus comes the role of systems depending on machine learning and deep learning in the creation of steps that diagnose and predict diseases, whether from clinical data or based on images, that provide tremendous clinical support by simulating human perception and can even diagnose diseases that are difficult to detect by human intelligence. Predictive analytics for healthcare a critical imperative in the healthcare industry. It can significantly affect the accuracy of disease prediction, which may lead to saving patients' lives in the case of accurate and timely prediction; on the contrary, in the case of an incorrect prediction, it may endanger patients' lives. Therefore, diseases must be accurately predicted and estimated. Hence, reliable and efficient methods for healthcare predictive analysis are essential. Therefore, this paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of existing machine learning and deep learning approaches utilized in healthcare prediction and identify the inherent obstacles to applying these approaches in the healthcare domain.",

        "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an epithelial cancer originating in the nasopharynx epithelium. Nevertheless, annotating pathology slides remains a bottleneck in the development of AI-driven pathology models and applications. In the present study, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for annotation by non-pathologists and to develop an efficient model for distinguishing NPC without the time-consuming involvement of pathologists. For this study, we gathered NPC slides from 251 different patients, comprising hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides, pan-cytokeratin (Pan-CK) IHC slides, and Epstein–Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) slides. The annotation of NPC regions in the H&E slides was carried out by a non-pathologist trainee who had access to corresponding Pan-CK IHC slides, both with and without EBER slides. The training process utilized ResNeXt, a deep neural network featuring a residual and inception architecture. In the validation set, NPC exhibited an AUC of 0.896, with a sensitivity of 0.919 and a specificity of 0.878. This study represents a significant breakthrough: the successful application of deep convolutional neural networks to identify NPC without the need for expert pathologist annotations. Our results underscore the potential of laboratory techniques to substantially reduce the workload of pathologists.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the advent of blockchain (BC) has sparked a digital revolution in different fields, such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain. It is used by smart healthcare systems to provide transparency and control for personal medical records. However, BC and healthcare integration still face many challenges, such as storing patient data and privacy and security issues. In the context of security, new attacks target different parts of the BC network, such as nodes, consensus algorithms, Smart Contracts (SC), and wallets. Fraudulent data insertion can have serious consequences on the integrity and reliability of the BC, as it can compromise the trustworthiness of the information stored on it and lead to incorrect or misleading transactions. Detecting and preventing fraudulent data insertion is crucial for maintaining the credibility of the BC as a secure and transparent system for recording and verifying transactions. SCs control the transfer of assets, which is why they may be subject to several adverbial attacks. Therefore, many efforts have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities and attacks in the SCs, such as utilizing programming tools. However, their proposals are inadequate against the newly emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Artificial Intelligence technology is robust in analyzing and detecting new attacks in every part of the BC network. Therefore, this article proposes a system architecture for detecting fraudulent transactions and attacks in the BC network based on Machine Learning (ML). It is composed of two stages: (1) Using ML to check medical data from sensors and block abnormal data from entering the blockchain network. (2) Using the same ML to check transactions in the blockchain, storing normal transactions, and marking abnormal ones as novel attacks in the attacks database. To build our system, we utilized two datasets and six machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest). The results demonstrate that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed others by achieving the highest accuracy, execution time, and scalability. Thereby, it was considered the best solution among the rest of the algorithms for tackling the research problem. Moreover, the security analysis of the proposed system proves its robustness against several attacks which threaten the functioning of the blockchain-based healthcare application.",

The issue of correct “Fach” determination depending on the presence of a lyric or dramatic voice structure is of crucial importance for opera singers, as chronic overuse often leads to vocal fold damage. To avoid phonomicrosurgery or prevent a premature career end, our aim is to offer singers an improved, objective fach counseling using digital sound analyses and machine learning procedures. For this purpose, a large database of 2004 sound samples from professional opera singers was compiled. Building on this dataset, we employed a classic ensemble learning method, namely the Random Forest algorithm, to construct an efficient fach classifier. This model was trained to learn from features embedded within the sound samples, subsequently enabling voice classification as either lyric or dramatic. As a result, the developed system can decide with an accuracy of about 80% in most examined voice types whether a sound sample has a lyric or dramatic character. To advance diagnostic tools and health in vocal arts medicine and singing voice pedagogy, further machine learning methods will be applied to find the best and most efficient classification method based on artificial intelligence approaches.",

        "abstract": "The Saudi population is at high risk of multimorbidity. The risk of these morbidities can be reduced by identifying common modifiable behavioural risk factors. This study uses statistical and machine learning methods to predict factors for multimorbidity in the Saudi population. Data from 23,098 Saudi residents were extracted from the “Sharik” Health Indicators Surveillance System 2021. Participants were asked about their demographics and health indicators. Binary logistic models were used to determine predictors of multimorbidity. A backpropagation neural network model was further run using the predictors from the logistic regression model. Accuracy measures were checked using training, validation, and testing data. Females and smokers had the highest likelihood of experiencing multimorbidity. Age and fruit consumption also played a significant role in predicting multimorbidity. Regarding model accuracy, both logistic regression and backpropagation algorithms yielded comparable outcomes. The backpropagation method (accuracy 80.7%) was more accurate than the logistic regression model (77%). Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict multimorbidity among adults, particularly in the Middle East region. Different testing methods later validated the common predicting factors identified in this study. These factors are helpful and can be translated by policymakers to consider improvements in the public health domain.",

        "abstract": "This study sought to investigate how different brain regions are affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at various phases of the disease, using independent component analysis (ICA). The study examines six regions in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, four in the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), six in the moderate stage, and six in the severe stage. The precuneus, cuneus, middle frontal gyri, calcarine cortex, superior medial frontal gyri, and superior frontal gyri were the areas impacted at all phases. A general linear model (GLM) is used to extract the voxels of the previously mentioned regions. The resting fMRI data for 18 AD patients who had advanced from MCI to stage 3 of the disease were obtained from the ADNI public source database. The subjects include eight women and ten men. The voxel dataset is used to train and test ten machine learning algorithms to categorize the MCI, mild, moderate, and severe stages of Alzheimer’s disease. The accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score were used as conventional scoring measures to evaluate the classification outcomes. AdaBoost fared better than the other algorithms and obtained a phenomenal accuracy of 98.61%, precision of 99.00%, and recall and F1 scores of 98.00% each.",

        "abstract": "To establish a diagnostic algorithm for predicting complicated appendicitis in children based on CT and clinical features. Methods: This retrospective study included 315 children (<18 years old) who were diagnosed with acute appendicitis and underwent appendectomy between January 2014 and December 2018. A decision tree algorithm was used to identify important features associated with the condition and to develop a diagnostic algorithm for predicting complicated appendicitis, including CT and clinical findings in the development cohort (n = 198). Complicated appendicitis was defined as gangrenous or perforated appendicitis. The diagnostic algorithm was validated using a temporal cohort (n = 117). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the algorithm. Results: All patients with periappendiceal abscesses, periappendiceal inflammatory masses, and free air on CT were diagnosed with complicated appendicitis. In addition, intraluminal air, transverse diameter of the appendix, and ascites were identified as important CT findings for predicting complicated appendicitis. C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and body temperature also showed important associations with complicated appendicitis. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the diagnostic algorithm comprising features were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.86–0.95), 91.8% (84.5–96.4), and 90.0% (82.4–95.1) in the development cohort, and 0.7 (0.63–0.84), 85.9% (75.0–93.4), and 58.5% (44.1–71.9) in test cohort, respectively. Conclusion: We propose a diagnostic algorithm based on a decision tree model using CT and clinical findings. This algorithm can be used to differentiate between complicated and noncomplicated appendicitis and to provide an appropriate treatment plan for children with acute appendicitis.",

        "abstract": "Background: Although handcrafted radiomics features (RF) are commonly extracted via radiomics software, employing deep features (DF) extracted from deep learning (DL) algorithms merits significant investigation. Moreover, a “tensor’’ radiomics paradigm where various flavours of a given feature are generated and explored can provide added value. We aimed to employ conventional and tensor DFs, and compare their outcome prediction performance to conventional and tensor RFs. Methods: 408 patients with head and neck cancer were selected from TCIA. PET images were first registered to CT, enhanced, normalized, and cropped. We employed 15 image-level fusion techniques (e.g., dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)) to combine PET and CT images. Subsequently, 215 RFs were extracted from each tumor in 17 images (or flavours) including CT only, PET only, and 15 fused PET-CT images through the standardized-SERA radiomics software. Furthermore, a 3 dimensional autoencoder was used to extract DFs. To predict the binary progression-free-survival-outcome, first, an end-to-end CNN algorithm was employed. Subsequently, we applied conventional and tensor DFs vs. RFs as extracted from each image to three sole classifiers, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), random-forest, and logistic regression (LR), linked with dimension reduction algorithms. Results: DTCWT fusion linked with CNN resulted in accuracies of 75.6 ± 7.0% and 63.4 ± 6.7% in five-fold cross-validation and external-nested-testing, respectively. For the tensor RF-framework, polynomial transform algorithms + analysis of variance feature selector (ANOVA) + LR enabled 76.67 ± 3.3% and 70.6 ± 6.7% in the mentioned tests. For the tensor DF framework, PCA + ANOVA + MLP arrived at 87.0 ± 3.5% and 85.3 ± 5.2% in both tests. Conclusions: This study showed that tensor DF combined with proper machine learning approaches enhanced survival prediction performance compared to conventional DF, tensor and conventional RF, and end-to-end CNN frameworks.",

Considering the importance of LOS in hospital resource management, this research aims to improve the accuracy of LOS prediction using hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Expert physicians and related studies were reviewed to determine the variables affecting LOS. The electronic medical records of 200 patients in the department of internal medicine of a hospital in Iran were collected randomly. As the performance of machine learning (ML) models can vary based on the characteristics of the features, several models were applied and evaluated in this study. In particular, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), multivariate regression, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and XGBoost have been evaluated and improved. The genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize the tree-based models. In addition, the dummy coding technique, sometimes called the One-Hot encoding, was used to encode categorical features to increase prediction accuracy. Compared with other algorithms, the XGBoost model optimized by GA (XGB_GA) achieved higher accuracy and better prediction performance. The mean and median of absolute errors in the test dataset for this model were 1.54 and 1.14 days, respectively. In other words, the XGB_GA model reduced the mean absolute error by 37%, which is beneficial in the reliable design of a clinical decision support system.",

The study was conducted in two phases: building the prediction model and evaluating its performance. Three models, namely, decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest were evaluated and compared to build the nurse turnover prediction model. The importance of turnover decision factors was also analyzed. The random forest model showed the highest accuracy of 0.97. The accuracy of turnover prediction within one year was improved to 98.9% with the optimized random forest. Salary was the most important decision factor for nurse turnover. The nurse turnover prediction model developed in this study can efficiently predict nurse turnover in Korea with minimal personnel and cost through machine learning. The model can effectively manage nurse turnover in a cost-effective manner if utilized in hospitals or nursing units.",

        "abstract": "Dengue fever, also known as break-bone fever, can be life-threatening. Caused by DENV, an RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family, dengue is currently a globally important public health problem. The clinical methods available for dengue diagnosis require skilled supervision. They are manual, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and not affordable to common people. This paper describes a method that can support clinicians during dengue diagnosis. It is proposed to automate the peripheral blood smear (PBS) examination using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid dengue diagnosis. Nowadays, AI, especially Machine Learning (ML), is increasingly being explored for successful analyses in the biomedical field. Digital pathology coupled with AI holds great potential in developing healthcare services. The automation system developed incorporates a blob detection method to detect platelets and thrombocytopenia from the PBS images. The results achieved are clinically acceptable. Moreover, an ML-based technique is proposed to detect dengue from the images of PBS based on the lymphocyte nucleus. Ten features are extracted, including six morphological and four Gray Level Spatial Dependance Matrix (GLSDM) features, out of the lymphocyte nucleus of normal and dengue cases. Features are then subjected to various popular supervised classifiers built using a ten-fold cross-validation policy for automated dengue detection. Among all the classifiers, the best performance was achieved by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), each with an accuracy of 93.62%. Furthermore, 1000 deep features extracted using pre-trained MobileNetV2 and 177 textural features extracted using Local binary pattern (LBP) from the lymphocyte nucleus are subjected to feature selection. The ReliefF selected 100 most significant features are then fed to the classifiers. The best performance was attained using an SVM classifier with 95.74% accuracy. With the obtained results, it is evident that this proposed approach can efficiently contribute as an adjuvant tool for diagnosing dengue from the digital microscopic images of PBS.",

        "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) pose significant burdens on individuals and society, necessitating accurate prediction methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms utilizing electronic health records and survey data offer promising tools for forecasting these conditions. However, potential bias and inaccuracies inherent in subjective survey responses can undermine the precision of such predictions. This research investigates the reliability of five prominent ML algorithms—a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes—in predicting MDD and GAD. A dataset rich in biomedical, demographic, and self-reported survey information is used to assess the algorithms’ performance under different levels of subjective response inaccuracies. These inaccuracies simulate scenarios with potential memory recall bias and subjective interpretations. While all algorithms demonstrate commendable accuracy with high-quality survey data, their performance diverges significantly when encountering erroneous or biased responses. Notably, the CNN exhibits superior resilience in this context, maintaining performance and even achieving enhanced accuracy, Cohen’s kappa score, and positive precision for both MDD and GAD. This highlights the CNN’s superior ability to handle data unreliability, making it a potentially advantageous choice for predicting mental health conditions based on self-reported data. These findings underscore the critical importance of algorithmic resilience in mental health prediction, particularly when relying on subjective data. They emphasize the need for careful algorithm selection in such contexts, with the CNN emerging as a promising candidate due to its robustness and improved performance under data uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "Core body temperature (CBT) is an important health indicator that denotes the temperature of the body core, and maintains brain and organ function. Invasive methods of CBT measurement pose challenges in assessing and monitoring human health. To address this, estimation of tympanic membrane temperature using multiple biological parameters often referenced for CBT has been attempted in previous studies. Our research focused on machine learning-based CBT estimation using hand-measurable biological data. Furthermore, while various studies have investigated machine learning models and the impact of information acquisition environments, few have compared the estimation accuracy of different biological parameters or assessed optimal feature combinations. Our proposed method entails the evaluation of indices in both normal scenarios with all variables and patterned scenarios with varying combinations of reduced explanatory variables. The comparison results reveal that when estimating the CBT based on skin conductance and pulse wave intervals excluding skin temperature, the mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and root mean square error were 0.17 °C, 0.71, and 0.24 °C, respectively. This suggests that our approach is a feasible CBT estimation method that does not rely on skin temperature, although accuracy concerns persist. Furthermore, the estimation of the difference between CBT and skin temperature suggests that the estimation method may have accounted for individual variations within the data. Implementing the proposed method in increasingly popular smart rings and watches could facilitate the acquisition of CBT in daily life.",

        "abstract": "As access to healthcare has become more central to people’s daily lives, the amount of medical big data has grown exponentially. Wearable Internet of Things (IoT)-reliant technology is gaining popularity in the medical field as a means to improve patient care and reduce wait times. In recent years, billions of sensors, devices, and machines have been hooked up to the web. One such technology, remote patient monitoring, is increasingly used in modern patient care and treatment. In addition, these developments pose substantial security issues about the recording of transaction data and the transmission of information itself, and pose considerable dangers to users’ privacy. Concerns about the privacy of a patient’s medical records have the ability to discontinue treatment, putting the patient’s life in threat. Thus, a system is proposed using machine learning in combination with blockchain technology to allow secure management as well as analysis of large amounts of healthcare data. With the help of machine learning, it is feasible to sort through all of the data and extract out only the most pertinent information. This is accomplished with the help of trained methodologies. After this data has been saved, the next issue will be the exchange of data and ensuring its trustworthiness. The concept of blockchain is introduced at this point. The Blockchain technology relies on consensus to ensure that all data is accurate and that all transactions are conducted in a safe manner. The management of healthcare is one area where blockchain technology offers the ability to have a huge impact by placing patients at the center of the system and improving the privacy and portability of health records. This study is primarily concerned with finding solutions to issues relating to the administration of healthcare data by utilizing Blockchain technology and incorporating some crucial characteristics developed with Machine Learning. The performance evaluation of proposed Support Vector Machine is compared with the other conventional machine learning classifiers. It is observed from the experimental finding that performance accuracy of Support vector machine is 98% which is better as compared to other traditional machine learning classifiers.",
