        "abstract": "The solar activity has various direct and indirect impacts on human activities. During periods of high solar activity, the harmful effects triggered by solar variability are maximized. On a decadal to multidecadal time scale, solar variability exhibits a main cycle of around 11 years known as the Schwabe solar cycle, leading to a solar maximum approximately every 11 years. The most commonly used variable for measuring solar activity is the sunspot number. Over the last few decades, numerous techniques have been employed to predict the time evolution of the solar cycle for subsequent years. Recently, there has been a growing number of studies utilizing machine learning methods to predict solar cycles. One such method is the Gaussian process, which is well-suited for working with small amounts of data and can also provide an uncertainty measure for predictions. In this study, the Gaussian process technique is employed to predict the sunspot number between 2024 and 2050. The dataset used to train and validate the model comprises monthly averages of sunspots relative to the period 1700-2023. According to the results, the current solar cycle, currently at its maximum, is anticipated to last until 2030. The subsequent solar maximum is projected to occur around the end of 2033, with an estimated maximum sunspot number of approximately 150. If this prediction holds true, the next solar cycle's maximum will resemble that observed in the current one.",

        "abstract": "AbstractRough surface simulations result in tight feedback loops in research procedures, such that they speed up studies for example about roughness’ impact on tribology or fluid dynamics. To model and simulate a broad spectrum of rough surfaces, Gaussian processes (GP) have been suggested recently. However, these models are limited on surfaces with small sizes since computational time-costs and memory-costs of simulations with standard procedures scale cubically and quadratically, respectively. In this paper, we apply the discrete filter approach which is a special case of GPs. We use the discrete filter with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to efficiently sample from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution and we compare its computational costs with the contour integral quadrature algorithm. Our experiments show that GPs benefit from FFT and allow stationary rough surfaces with sizes as large as 30, 000 × 30, 000 to be efficiently sampled. Since this approach is complementary to the GP and noise model approach, we also show simulations of rough surfaces with underlying non-Gaussian noise models that can reduce computational complexity.

The circuit devices under study are bipolar junction transistors, which are used to amplify electrical current. To aid with the design of the device, a computer model predicts its peak output as a function of the input dosage and a number of design parameters. The methodology also involves a novel sequential design procedure to generate data to fit the emulator. Both physical and computer simulation experiments are performed, and the results show that the TGP model can be useful for spatial data and semiparametric regression in the context of a computer experiment for designing a circuit device, for sequential design of (computer) experiments, sequential robust local optimization, validation, calibration, and sensitivity analysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundUnderstanding the synergetic and antagonistic effects of combinations of drugs and toxins is vital for many applications, including treatment of multifactorial diseases and ecotoxicological monitoring. Synergy is usually assessed by comparing the response of drug combinations to a predicted non-interactive response from reference (null) models. Possible choices of null models are Loewe additivity, Bliss independence and the recently rediscovered Hand model. A different approach is taken by the MuSyC model, which directly fits a generalization of the Hill model to the data. All of these models, however, fit the dose-response relationship with a parametric model.ResultsWe propose the Hand-GP model, a non-parametric model based on the combination of the Hand model with Gaussian processes. We introduce a new logarithmic squared exponential kernel for the Gaussian process which captures the logarithmic dependence of response on dose. From the monotherapeutic response and the Hand principle, we construct a null reference response and synergy is assessed from the difference between this null reference and the Gaussian process fitted response. We evaluated performance of our model on a simulated data from Greco, two simulated data sets of our own design and two benchmark data sets from Chou and Talalay. We compare the Hand-GP model to standard synergy models and show that our model performs better than these standards. We also compare our model to the MuSyC model as example of a recent method which also fits a complete dose-response surface. Also in this case, the Hand-GP model performs better.ConclusionThe Hand-GP model is a flexible model to capture synergy. Its non-parametric natures allows it to model a wide variety of response patterns.",

Uncertainty can help in this setting to make predictions more informative with regard to class relationships. This is of particular interest due to the often highly related nature of the distinguished soil types. Incorporating knowledge about class structure into the model also provides opportunity for improving the model accuracy. Our main focus, however, is to enable modellers to better understand and work with this structure during analysis.&lt;br&gt;For example, post-hoc aggregation of class labels into supersets facilitates applications such as letting the model choose an ontological level on which it can confidently distinguish the output class. It can likewise be used to determine the combined probability of specified classes that share a property of interest.&lt;br&gt;Technically, this works by learning a latent Gaussian distribution, for example using a Gaussian Process model, and mapping it to a distribution over the class probabilities. We demonstrate this approach, explore possible applications for exploiting uncertainty information, in particular with regard to the class hierarchy, and compare the performance of different model variants in terms of accuracy and calibration.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "abstract": "Accurate predictions of acid dissociation constants are  essential to  rational molecular design in the pharmaceutical industry and elsewhere.  There has been much interest in developing new machine learning methods that can produce fast and accurate pK<sub>a</sub> predictions for arbitrary species, as well as  estimates of prediction uncertainty. Previously, as part of the SAMPL6 community-wide blind challenge, Bannan et al. approached the problem of predicting pK<sub>a</sub>s by using a Gaussian process regression to predict microscopic pK<sub>a</sub>s, from which macroscopic pK<sub>a</sub> values can be analytically computed. While this method can make reasonably quick and accurate predictions using a small training set, accuracy was limited by the lack of a sufficiently broad range of chemical space in the training set (e.g., the inclusion of polyprotic acids). Here, to address this issue, we construct a deep Gaussian Process (GP) model that can include more features without invoking the curse of dimensionality. We trained both a standard GP and a deep GP model using a database of approximately 3500 small molecules curated from public sources, filtered by similarity to targets.   We tested the model on both the SAMPL6 and more recent SAMPL7 challenge, which introduced a similar lack of ionizable sites and/or environments found between the test set and the previous training set.  The results show that while the deep GP model made only minor improvements over the standard GP model for SAMPL6 predictions, it made significant improvements over the standard GP model in SAMPL7 macroscopic predictions, achieving a MAE of 1.5 pK<sub>a</sub>.",

        "abstract": "AbstractHealthy human postural sway exhibits strong intermittency, reflecting a richly interactive foundation of postural control. From a linear perspective, intermittent fluctuations might be interpreted as engagement and disengagement of complementary control processes at distinct timescales or from a nonlinear perspective, as cascade-like interactions across many timescales at once. The diverse control processes entailed by cascade-like multiplicative dynamics suggest specific non-Gaussian distributional properties at different timescales. Multiscale probability density function (PDF) analysis showed that when standing quietly while balancing a sand-filled tube with the two arms elicited non-Gaussianity profiles showing a negative-quadratic crossover between short and long timescales. A more stringent task of balancing a water-filled tube elicited simpler monotonic decreases in non-Gaussianity, that is, a positive-quadratic cancellation of the negative-quadratic crossover. Multiple known indices of postural sway governed the appearance or disappearance of the crossover. Finally, both tasks elicited lognormal distributions over progressively larger timescales. These results provide the first evidence that more stringent postural constraints recruit shorter-timescale processes into the non-Gaussian cascade processes, that indices of postural sway moderate this recruitment, and that more stringent postural constraints show stronger statistical hallmarks of cascade structure.",

We then move to linear processes with long memory and obtain the CLT under various dependence structures for the innovations by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of linear statistics.

Yet, their lack of physical interpretability limits their wider adoption. In fact, the exploration of future emission scenarios still relies on one-dimensional energy balance models which can lack the flexibility to capture certain climate responses.Here, we propose a statistically-driven emulator that hinges on an energy balance model. Using Gaussian processes, we formulate an emulator of temperature response that exactly satisfies the physical thermal response equations of an energy balance model. The result is an emulator that (1) enjoys the flexibility of statistical machine learning models and can be fitted against observations to produce spatially-resolved predictions (2) has physically-interpretable parameters that can be used to make inference about the climate system. This model shows skilfull prediction of annual mean global distribution of temperature, even over scenarios outside the range of observed emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols during training &#8212; improvement in RMSE of 27% against the energy balance model and of 60% against a physics-free machine learning model. In addition, the Bayesian nature of our formulation provides a principled way to perform uncertainty quantification on the predictions.We outline how the probabilistic nature of this emulator makes it a natural candidate for detection and attribution studies and discuss extension to a precipitation emulator also incorporating physical constraints. We hope that by combining the ability of machine learning techniques to capture complex patterns with the interpretability of energy balance models, our work will produce a reliable tool for efficiently and accurately exploring future climates.",

        "abstract": "AbstractCigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, accounting for nearly half a million deaths annually. Given the recent rise of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications, computational assessment of smoking behaviors is a promising direction. In this study, we aim to recognize and classify addiction patterns in individual smokers’ daily usage based on time series data. To this end, we leverage Gaussian process modeling to iteratively learn a function that defines a smoker’s behavior as usage data is accumulated. Namely, we aim to learn weekly periodic trends in usage, and then utilize the model to predict future trends. We demonstrate that the outputted predictions resemble the actual data well, and that these informed forecasts significantly outperform those of a naive prediction model with respect to accuracy. Finally, we propose strategies for utilizing these predictions for goal-setting as part of a computer-supervised gradual cessation program.",

The proposed GP similarity is similar to a Bayes factor and provides enhanced robustness to noise in sparse time series, such as those found in various biological settings, e.g., gene transcriptomics. We show that the GP measure is equivalent to the Euclidean distance when the noise variance in the GP is negligible compared to the noise variance of the signal. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data show improved performance of the GP similarity when used in conjunction with two distance-based clustering methods.",

        "abstract": "\r\nEikonal tomography has become a popular methodology for deriving phase velocity maps from surface wave phase delay measurements. Its high efficiency makes it popular for handling datasets deriving from large-N arrays, in particular in the ambient-noise tomography setting. However, the results of eikonal tomography are crucially dependent on the way in which phase delay measurements are predicted from data, a point which has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, I provide a rigorous formulation for eikonal tomography using Gaussian processes (GPs) to smooth observed phase delay measurements, including uncertainties. GPs allow the posterior phase delay gradient to be analytically derived. From the phase delay gradient, an excellent approximate solution for phase velocities can be obtained using the saddlepoint method. The result is a fully Bayesian result for phase velocities of surface waves, incorporating the nonlinear wavefront bending inherent in eikonal tomography, with no sampling required. The results of this analysis imply that the uncertainties reported for eikonal tomography are often underestimated.\r\n",

        "abstract": "Multicellular systems play an important role in many biotechnological processes. Typically, these exhibit cell-to-cell variability, which has to be monitored closely for process control and optimization. However, some properties may not be measurable due to technical and financial restrictions. To improve the monitoring, model-based online estimators can be designed for their reconstruction. The multicellular dynamics is accounted for in the framework of population balance models (PBMs). These models are based on single cell kinetics, and each cellular state translates directly into an additional dimension of the obtained partial differential equations. As multicellular dynamics often require detailed single cell models and feature a high number of cellular components, the resulting population balance equations are often high-dimensional. Therefore, established state estimation concepts for PBMs based on discrete grids are not recommended due to the large computational effort. In this contribution a novel approach is proposed, which is based on the approximation of the underlying number density functions as the weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. Thus, the distribution is described by the characteristic properties of the individual Gaussians, like the mean and covariance. Thereby, the complex infinite dimensional estimation problem can be reduced to a finite dimension. The characteristic properties are estimated in a recursive approach. The method is evaluated for two academic benchmark examples, and the results indicate its potential for model-based online reconstruction for multicellular systems.",
