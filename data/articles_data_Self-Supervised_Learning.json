        "abstract": "Language as an abstraction for hierarchical agents is promising to solve compositional long-time horizon decision-making tasks. The learning of the agent poses significant challenges, as it typically requires plenty of trajectories annotated with languages. This paper addresses the challenge of learning such an agent under the scarcity of language annotations. One approach for leveraging unannotated data is to generate pseudo-labels for unannotated trajectories using sparse seed annotations. However, as the scenes of the environment and tasks assigned to the agent are diverse, the inference of language instructions is sometimes incorrect, causing the policy to learn to ground incorrect instructions to actions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised language-conditioned hierarchical skill policy (SLHSP) which utilizes unannotated data to learn reusable and general task-related skills to facilitate learning from sparse annotations. We demonstrate that the SLHSP that learned with less than 10% of annotated trajectories has a comparable performance to one that learned with 100% of annotated data. Our approach to the challenging ALFRED benchmark leads to a notable improvement in the success rate over a strong baseline also optimized for sparsely annotated data.",

        "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown tremendously in recent years. Typically, bilingual, and multilingual translation models have been deployed widely in machine translation and gained vast attention from the research community. On the contrary, few studies have focused on translating between spoken and sign languages, especially non-English languages. Prior works on Sign Language Translation (SLT) have shown that a mid-level sign gloss representation enhances translation performance. Therefore, this study presents a new large-scale Korean sign language dataset, the Museum-Commentary Korean Sign Gloss (MCKSG) dataset, including 3828 pairs of Korean sentences and their corresponding sign glosses used in Museum-Commentary contexts. In addition, we propose a translation framework based on self-supervised learning, where the pretext task is a text-to-text from a Korean sentence to its back-translation versions, then the pre-trained network will be fine-tuned on the MCKSG dataset. Using self-supervised learning help to overcome the drawback of a shortage of sign language data. Through experimental results, our proposed model outperforms a baseline BERT model by 6.22%.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to leveraging features learned from both supervised and self-supervised paradigms, to improve image classification tasks, specifically for vehicle classification. Two state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods, DINO and data2vec, were evaluated and compared for their representation learning of vehicle images. The former contrasts local and global views while the latter uses masked prediction on multiple layered representations. In the latter case, supervised learning is employed to finetune a pretrained YOLOR object detector for detecting vehicle wheels, from which definitive wheel positional features are retrieved. The representations learned from these self-supervised learning methods were combined with the wheel positional features for the vehicle classification task. Particularly, a random wheel masking strategy was utilized to finetune the previously learned representations in harmony with the wheel positional features during the training of the classifier. Our experiments show that the data2vec-distilled representations, which are consistent with our wheel masking strategy, outperformed the DINO counterpart, resulting in a celebrated Top-1 classification accuracy of 97.2% for classifying the 13 vehicle classes defined by the Federal Highway Administration.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised Learning (SSL) is a machine learning algorithm for pretraining Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) without requiring manually labeled data. The central idea of this learning technique is based on an auxiliary stage aka pretext task in which labeled data are created automatically through data augmentation and exploited for pretraining the DNN. However, the effect of each pretext task is not well studied or compared in the literature. In this paper, we study the contribution of augmentation operators on the performance of self supervised learning algorithms in a constrained settings. We propose an evolutionary search method for optimization of data augmentation pipeline in pretext tasks and measure the impact of augmentation operators in several SOTA SSL algorithms. By encoding different combination of augmentation operators in chromosomes we seek the optimal augmentation policies through an evolutionary optimization mechanism. We further introduce methods for analyzing and explaining the performance of optimized SSL algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed method can find solutions that outperform the accuracy of classification of SSL algorithms which confirms the influence of augmentation policy choice on the overall performance of SSL algorithms. We also compare optimal SSL solutions found by our evolutionary search mechanism and show the effect of batch size in the pretext task on two visual datasets.",

        "abstract": "Many new reconstruction techniques have been deployed to allow low-dose CT examinations. Such reconstruction techniques exhibit nonlinear properties, which strengthen the need for a task-based measure of image quality. The Hotelling observer (HO) is the optimal linear observer and provides a lower bound of the Bayesian ideal observer detection performance. However, its computational complexity impedes its widespread practical usage. To address this issue, we proposed a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based model observer to provide accurate estimates of HO performance in very low-dose chest CT images. Our approach involved a two-stage model combining a convolutional denoising auto-encoder (CDAE) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine for classification. To evaluate this approach, we conducted signal detection tasks employing chest CT images with different noise structures generated by computer-based simulations. We compared this approach with two supervised learning-based methods: a single-layer neural network (SLNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that the CDAE-based model was able to achieve similar detection performance to the HO. In addition, it outperformed both SLNN and CNN when a reduced number of training images was considered. The proposed approach holds promise for optimizing low-dose CT protocols across scanner platforms.",

        "abstract": "Learning universal time series representations applicable to various types of downstream tasks is challenging but valuable in real applications. Recently, researchers have attempted to leverage the success of self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) in Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) to tackle time series representation. Nevertheless, due to the special temporal characteristics, relying solely on empirical guidance from other domains may be ineffective for time series and difficult to adapt to multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we review three parts involved in SSCL including 1) designing augmentation methods for positive pairs, 2) constructing (hard) negative pairs, and 3) designing SSCL loss. For 1) and 2), we find that unsuitable positive and negative pair construction may introduce inappropriate inductive biases, which neither preserve temporal properties nor provide sufficient discriminative features. For 3), just exploring segment- or instance-level semantics information is not enough for learning universal representation. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TimesURL. Specifically, we first introduce a frequency-temporal-based augmentation to keep the temporal property unchanged. And then, we construct double Universums as a special kind of hard negative to guide better contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce time reconstruction as a joint optimization objective with contrastive learning to capture both segment-level and instance-level information. As a result, TimesURL can learn high-quality universal representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in 6 different downstream tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, anomaly detection and transfer learning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nMotivation\nProtein representation learning methods have shown great potential to many downstream tasks in biological applications. A few recent studies have demonstrated that the self-supervised learning is a promising solution to addressing insufficient labels of proteins, which is a major obstacle to effective protein representation learning. However, existing protein representation learning is usually pretrained on protein sequences without considering the important protein structural information.\n\n\nResults\nIn this work, we propose a novel structure-aware protein self-supervised learning method to effectively capture structural information of proteins. In particular, a graph neural network model is pretrained to preserve the protein structural information with self-supervised tasks from a pairwise residue distance perspective and a dihedral angle perspective, respectively. Furthermore, we propose to leverage the available protein language model pretrained on protein sequences to enhance the self-supervised learning. Specifically, we identify the relation between the sequential information in the protein language model and the structural information in the specially designed graph neural network model via a novel pseudo bi-level optimization scheme. We conduct experiments on three downstream tasks: the binary classification into membrane/non-membrane proteins, the location classification into 10 cellular compartments, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction classification into 384 EC numbers, and these experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n\nAvailability and implementation\nThe Alphafold2 database is available in https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/. The PDB files are available in https://www.rcsb.org/. The downstream tasks are available in https://github.com/phermosilla/IEConv\\_proteins/tree/master/Datasets.

It is efficient because it learns from large‚Äêscale unlabeled data and through continuous research, performance comparable to supervised learning has been reached. Contrastive learning, a type of self‚Äêsupervised learning algorithm, utilizes data similarity to perform instance‚Äêlevel learning within an embedding space. However, it suffers from the problem of false‚Äênegatives, which are the misclassification of data class during training the data representation. They result in loss of information and deteriorate the performance of the model. This study employed cosine similarity and temperature simultaneously to identify false‚Äênegatives and mitigate their impact to improve the performance of the contrastive learning model. The proposed method exhibited a performance improvement of up to 2.7% compared with the existing algorithm on the CIFAR‚Äê100 dataset. Improved performance on other datasets such as CIFAR‚Äê10 and ImageNet was also observed.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of deep learning and the accessibility of massive data, scene classification algorithms based on deep learning have been extensively researched and have achieved exciting developments. However, the success of deep models often relies on a large amount of annotated remote sensing data. Additionally, deep models are typically trained and tested on the same set of classes, leading to compromised generalization performance when encountering new classes. This is where few-shot learning aims to enable models to quickly generalize to new classes with only a few reference samples. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative self-supervised transductive few-shot learning (CS2TFSL) algorithm for remote sensing scene classification. In our approach, we construct two distinct self-supervised auxiliary tasks to jointly train the feature extractor, aiming to obtain a powerful representation. Subsequently, the feature extractor‚Äôs parameters are frozen, requiring no further training, and transferred to the inference stage. During testing, we employ transductive inference to enhance the associative information between the support and query sets by leveraging additional sample information in the data. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art few-shot scene classification algorithms on the WHU-RS19 and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CS2TFSL. More specifically, CS2TFSL ranks first in the settings of five-way one-shot and five-way five-shot. Additionally, detailed ablation experiments are conducted to analyze the CS2TFSL. The experimental results reveal significant and promising performance improvements in few-shot scene classification through the combination of self-supervised learning and direct transductive inference.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method called Grouped Contrastive Learning of self-supervised Sentence Representation (GCLSR), which can learn an effective and meaningful representation of sentences. Previous works maximize the similarity between two vectors to be the objective of contrastive learning, suffering from the high-dimensionality of the vectors. In addition, most previous works have adopted discrete data augmentation to obtain positive samples and have directly employed a contrastive framework from computer vision to perform contrastive training, which could hamper contrastive training because text data are discrete and sparse compared with image data. To solve these issues, we design a novel framework of contrastive learning, i.e., GCLSR, which divides the high-dimensional feature vector into several groups and respectively computes the groups‚Äô contrastive losses to make use of more local information, eventually obtaining a more fine-grained sentence representation. In addition, in GCLSR, we design a new self-attention mechanism and both a continuous and a partial-word vector augmentation (PWVA). For the discrete and sparse text data, the use of self-attention could help the model focus on the informative words by measuring the importance of every word in a sentence. By using the PWVA, GCLSR can obtain high-quality positive samples used for contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GCLSR achieves an encouraging result on the challenging datasets of the semantic textual similarity (STS) task and transfer task.",

Emotion recognition based on physiological signals can objectively reflect the most authentic emotional states of humans. However, existing labeled Electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets are often of small scale.MethodsIn practical scenarios, a large number of unlabeled EEG signals are easier to obtain. Therefore, this paper adopts self-supervised learning methods to study emotion recognition based on EEG. Specifically, experiments employ three pre-defined tasks to define pseudo-labels and extract features from the inherent structure of the data.Results and discussionExperimental results indicate that self-supervised learning methods have the capability to learn effective feature representations for downstream tasks without any manual labels.",

The approach is mainly to solve the problem of a few training datasets resulting in model overfitting, which affects model performance. The study was carried out on publications retrieved from various digital libraries such as SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, which formed the Primary studies. Secondary studies were retrieved from Primary articles using the backward and forward snowballing approach. Based on set inclusion and exclusion parameters, relevant publications were selected for review. The study focused on transfer learning pretrained NLP models based on the deep transformer network. BERT and GPT were the two elite pretrained models trained to classify global and local representations based on larger unlabeled text datasets through self-supervised learning. Pretrained transformer models offer numerous advantages to natural language processing models, such as knowledge transfer to downstream tasks that deal with drawbacks associated with training a model from scratch. This review gives a comprehensive view of transformer architecture, self-supervised learning and pretraining concepts in language models, and their adaptation to downstream tasks. Finally, we present future directions to further improvement in pretrained transformer-based language models.",

        "abstract": "The hickory (Carya cathayensis) nuts are considered as a traditional nut in Asia due to nutritional components such as phenols and steroids, amino acids and minerals, and especially high levels of unsaturated fatty acids. However, the edible quality of hickory nuts is rapidly deteriorated by oxidative rancidity. Deeper Masked autoencoders (DEEPMAE) with a unique structure for automatically extracting some features that could be scaleable from local to global for image classification, has been considered to be a state-of-the-art computer vision technique for grading tasks. This paper aims to present a novel and accurate method for grading hickory nuts with different oxidation levels. Owing to the use of self-supervised and supervised processes, this method is able to predict images of hickory nuts with different oxidation levels effectively, i.e., DEEPMAE can predict the oxidation level of nuts. The proposed DEEPMAE model was constructed from Vision Transformer (VIT) architecture which was followed by Masked autoencoders(MAE). This model was trained and tested on image datasets containing four classes, and the differences between these classes were mainly caused by varying levels of oxidation over time. The DEEPMAE model was able to achieve an overall classification accuracy of 96.14% on the validation set and 96.42% on the test set. The results on the suggested model demonstrated that the application of the DEEPMAE model might be a promising method for grading hickory nuts with different levels of oxidation.",

        "abstract": "The 2S-DT (Self-Supervised Decomposition for Transfer Learning) model, created for crop categorization using remotely sensed data, is a unique method introduced in this paper. It deals with the difficulty of incorrectly identifying crops with comparable phenology patterns, a problem that frequently arises in agricultural remote sensing. Two datasets from Nanajangudu taluk in the Mysore district, which has a widely varied irrigated agriculture system, are used to assess the model. Using self-supervised learning, the 2S-DT model addresses the misclassification issue that frequently occurs when working with unlabeled classes, especially in high-resolution images. It uses class decomposition (CD) layer and a downstream learning approach. Using the model‚Äôs learning and the particulars of each geographical context, this layer improves the information‚Äôs arrangement. Our model architecture‚Äôs foundation is ResNet, a well-known deep learning framework. Each residual block in our ResNet architecture is made up of two 3x3 convolutional layers. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions, which improve the model‚Äôs capacity for learning. We utilized a 7x7 convolutional layer with 64 filters and a stride of 2 for Conv1 in ResNet18, resulting in an output size of 112x112x64. Conv2, which consists of Res2a and Res2b, generated an output with the dimensions 48x48x64. Conv3, which included Res3a and Res3b, produced an output with the dimensions 28x28x128. These architectural selections were made with our experimental needs in mind. The 2S-DT model‚Äôs newly added features make it easier to identify classes and update weights, improving the stability of the features‚Äô spatial and spectral data. Extensive tests performed on two datasets show the model‚Äôs viability. Overall accuracy has improved significantly, with the 2S-DT model surpassing comparable models like TVSM, 3DCAE, and GAN Model by obtaining 95.65% accuracy for dataset 1 and 88.91% accuracy for dataset 2.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDrug‚Äìdrug interactions (DDI) are a critical concern in healthcare due to their potential to cause adverse effects and compromise patient safety. Supervised machine learning models for DDI prediction need to be optimized to learn abstract, transferable features, and generalize to larger chemical spaces, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled DDI data. Inspired by recent advances in computer vision, we present SMR‚ÄìDDI, a self-supervised framework that leverages contrastive learning to embed drugs into a scaffold-based feature space. Molecular scaffolds represent the core structural motifs that drive pharmacological activities, making them valuable for learning informative representations. Specifically, we pre-trained SMR‚ÄìDDI on a large-scale unlabeled molecular dataset. We generated augmented views for each molecule via SMILES enumeration and optimized the embedding process through contrastive loss minimization between views. This enables the model to capture relevant and robust molecular features while reducing noise. We then transfer the learned representations for the downstream prediction of DDI. Experiments show that the new feature space has comparable expressivity to state-of-the-art molecular representations and achieved competitive DDI prediction results while training on less data. Additional investigations also revealed that pre-training on more extensive and diverse unlabeled molecular datasets improved the model‚Äôs capability to embed molecules more effectively. Our results highlight contrastive learning as a promising approach for DDI prediction that can identify potentially hazardous drug combinations using only structural information.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in supervised learning tasks but are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without explicit labels. Information theory has shaped deep neural networks, particularly the information bottleneck principle. This principle optimizes the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning approaches from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing a unified framework that encapsulates the self-supervised information-theoretic learning problem. This framework includes multiple encoders and decoders, suggesting that all existing work on self-supervised learning can be seen as specific instances. We aim to unify these approaches to understand their underlying principles better and address the main challenge: many works present different frameworks with differing theories that may seem contradictory. By weaving existing research into a cohesive narrative, we delve into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, spotlight potential research areas, and highlight inherent challenges. Moreover, we discuss how to estimate information-theoretic quantities and their associated empirical problems. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the intersection of information theory, self-supervised learning, and deep neural networks, aiming for a better understanding through our proposed unified approach.",

Traditional methods often rely heavily on large labeled datasets for training, which can be costly and time-consuming to acquire. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming to reduce this dependency by leveraging the inherent structures within the data itself. In this paper, we explore novel self-supervised learning techniques tailored specifically for image reconstruction tasks. We propose approaches that exploit the inherent relationships between low and high-resolution images, utilize context-aware information for inpainting, and incorporate generative adversarial networks for denoising. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods in achieving competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. Our findings pave the way for more efficient and scalable solutions in image reconstruction, offering practical benefits across a wide range of applications",

        "abstract": "AbstractAs an essential process in subsurface interpretation, seismic‚Äêwell tie aims at calibrating the well measurements in depth domain with the seismic records in time domain for reliable reservoir mapping and modelling. Such a process usually requires massive manual efforts, primarily extracting source wavelets to synthesize seismograms from well measurements and stretching/squeezing synthetic seismograms to match actual seismic signals, and thus becomes time‚Äêconsuming and labour intensive with the amount of wells expanding in a field. This paper formulates the seismic‚Äêwell tie problem from the perspective of computer vision and, considering the lack of manually prepared training labels in most of real projects, proposes automating it by a self‚Äêsupervised workflow of two key components. The first component is to extract time‚Äêvariant wavelets in the target interval using a dual‚Äêtask autoencoder, which is optimized by maximizing the spectrum similarity between the extracted wavelet and the actual seismic. The second component is to estimate the corresponding time‚Äêshift between a pair of the synthetic seismogram and the actual seismic using a flow net, which is trained by a pseudo dataset derived from the actual well measurements. More specifically, the data generation consists with defining one‚Äêdimensional time‚Äêshift curves to warp the original less accurate time‚Äêdepth relationships and then synthesizing the corresponding seismograms based on the convolutional model at all available wells. When turning to the stage of inference at a target well, the proposed workflow automatically extracts a representative wavelet, generates the corresponding synthetic seismogram from the original time‚Äêdepth relationship and estimates the time‚Äêshift curve necessary for revising the original time‚Äêdepth relationship that would lead to an optimal tying with the actual seismic at the well. The proposed workflow is tested on two field datasets, and both results demonstrate improved tying over traditional methods such as statistical wavelet extraction and dynamic time warping.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRepresentation learning has proven to be a powerful methodology in a wide variety of machine-learning applications. For atmospheric dynamics, however, it has so far not been considered, arguably due to the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets that could be used for training. In this work, we show how to sidestep the difficulty and introduce a self-supervised learning task that is applicable to a wide variety of unlabeled atmospheric datasets. Specifically, we train a neural network on the simple yet intricate task of predicting the temporal distance between atmospheric fields from distinct but nearby times. We demonstrate that training with this task on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset leads to internal representations that capture intrinsic aspects of atmospheric dynamics. For example, when employed as a loss function in other machine-learning applications, the derived AtmoDist distance leads to improved results compared to the \n\n\n$ {\\mathrm{\\ell}}_2 $\n\n-loss. For downscaling one obtains higher resolution fields that match the true statistics more closely than previous approaches and for the interpolation of missing or occluded data the AtmoDist distance leads to results that contain more realistic fine-scale features. Since it is obtained from observational data, AtmoDist also provides a novel perspective on atmospheric predictability.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDiffraction wavefield contains valuable information on subsurface composition through velocity extraction and sometimes anisotropy estimation. It can also be used for the delineation of geological features, such as faults, fractures and mineral deposits. Diffraction recognition is, therefore, crucial for improved interpretation of seismic data. To date, many workflows for diffraction denoising, including deep‚Äêlearning applications, have been provided, however, with a major focus on sedimentary settings or for ground‚Äêpenetrating radar data. In this study, we have developed a workflow for a self‚Äêsupervised learning technique, an autoencoder, for diffraction denoising on synthetic seismic, ground‚Äêpenetrating radar and hardrock seismic datasets. The autoencoder provides promising results especially for the ground‚Äêpenetrating radar data. Depending on the target of the studies, diffraction signals can be tackled using the autoencoder both as the signal and/or noise when, for example, a reflection is a target. The real hardrock seismic data required additional pre‚Äê and post‚Äêautoencoder image processing steps to improve automatic delineation of the diffraction. Here, we also coupled the autoencoder with Hough transform and pixel edge detection filters. Along inlines and crosslines, diffraction signals have sometimes a similar character as the reflection and may spatially be correlated making the denoising workflow unsuccessful. Coupled with additional image processing steps, we successfully isolated diffraction that is generated from a known volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit. These encouraging results suggest that the self‚Äêsupervised learning techniques such as the autoencoder can be used also for seismic mineral exploration purposes and are worthy to be implemented as additional tools for data processing and target detections.",

        "abstract": "Facial motion representation learning has become an exciting research topic, since biometric technologies are becoming more common in our daily lives. One of its applications is identity verification. After recording a dynamic facial motion video for enrollment, the user needs to show a matched facial appearance and make a facial motion the same as the enrollment for authentication. Some recent research papers have discussed the benefits of this new biometric technology and reported promising results for both static and dynamic facial motion verification tasks. Our work extends the existing approaches and introduces compound facial actions, which contain more than one dominant facial action in one utterance. We propose a new self-supervised pretraining method called contrastive subclips that improves the model performance with these more complex and secure facial motions. The experimental results show that the contrastive subclips method improves upon the baseline approaches, and the model performance for test data can reach 89.7% average precision.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical examination of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models and their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanisms. We begin by defining natural language space and knowledge space, which are two key concepts for understanding the dimensionality reduction process in GPT-based large language models (LLMs). By exploring projection functions and their inverses, we establish a framework for analyzing the language generation capabilities of these models. We then investigate the GPT representation space, examining its implications for the models‚Äô approximation properties. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of GPT models and their learning mechanisms, considering trade-offs between complexity and generalization, as well as the implications of incomplete inverse projection functions. Our findings demonstrate that GPT models possess the capability to encode knowledge into low-dimensional vectors through their autoregressive self-supervised learning mechanism. This comprehensive analysis provides a solid mathematical foundation for future advancements in GPT-based LLMs, promising advancements in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering due to improved understanding and optimization of model training and performance.",
