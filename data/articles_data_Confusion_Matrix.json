In the multi-class classification task, where each instance can only be labeled as one class, the confusion matrix is a powerful tool for performance assessment by quantifying the classification overlap. However, in the multi-label classification task, where each instance can be labeled with more than one class, the confusion matrix is undefined. Performance assessment of the multi-label classifier is currently based on calculating performance averages, such as hamming loss, precision, recall, and F-score.

To address this gap, we define a method of creating the multi-label confusion matrix (MLCM) based on three proposed categories of multi-label problems.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn an earlier article, we outlined the process of developing a Machine Learning project that is often complex to establish, and that the problem must be broken down into several stages to facilitate its resolution [1]. We were able to identify 5 steps that we think are the most important to tackle such a project. These 5 steps are : the definition of the problem, the preparation of the data, the choice of the right algorithms, the optimization of the results and the presentation of the final results. In this manuscript, we will propose the application of different ways of evaluating classification models through an algorithm that predicts whether there is a fire in a given location or not. We are conscious that this problem is difficult to solve, especially when we have to predict the latter when there is none, do not predict when there is really one, or not predict when there is none. The method of this study will show how to choose the right algorithm and how to Evaluate it. The experiment shows promising results obtained thanks to the classification model algorithm and confusion matrix which provide fire detection accuracy around 92.71%.",

Starting with demos using data from hypothetical experiments in machine vision, students were exposed to the topics of confusion matrix, transition matrix, receiver operating characteristic curves, Bayes’ rule, and concepts of random variables bridging the gap between theory and applications. Student were given unique data sets requiring estimation of a priori and conditional probabilities, positive predictive values, and error rates in the machine vision classifier. Student surveys conducted at the start and conclusion of the course seem to suggest that they gained an enhanced understanding of the applications of probability concepts to data analytics. The methodology can easily be extended to cover other topics such as hypothesis testing and diversity analysis to shift the emphasis of the engineering probability course from pure theory to applications.",

        "abstract": "This research primarily deals with mathematically ranking the level of accuracy of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning classifiers, using Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), leveraging Confusion Matrices. A detailed Literature survey was done to gather the existing knowledge. This knowledge was used as foundational basis to further build the scope of this research project. The classifiers used were Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These classifiers were used for Face recognition of individuals. A total of 33 adult test subjects with 10 images per subject resulting in a total of 330 distinct images were part of this research project. These test subjects were from the Labeled Faces in The Wild publicly available database along with teachers from James B. Conant High School who voluntarily participated in this research. Python based face recognition program wrappers and associated environment was built around pre-existing classifiers and the image data was passed to these wrappers. These wrappers recognized the faces of individuals in the images over 10 trials wherein each trial consisted of 33 distinct images, with varying degree of accuracy and presented that as outputs. These outputs were used to determine the Confusion Matrices which in turn were used to calculate the MCC scores. The MCC scores were plotted, and these results showed that the SVM AI classifier had the highest level of relative accuracy for face recognition, followed by KNN and CNN classifiers.",

The motion recognition system recognizes physical attacks so that teachers can resolve disputes early to reduce other greater injuries. In the beginning, cameras were used in this system to monitor students’ classroom activities and to obtain body images by removing background and saliency maps. Two angles from arm to shoulder and shoulder to the center of the body are then measured and the velocity between the two frames from the movement of the body is detected, and use these angle and velocity values as the criterion for judging whether it is a physical attack. In the end, the accuracy of the proposed algorithms is verified by using the confusion matrix based on machine learning and the minimum cross entropy based on neural networks. The simulation proves that the proposed algorithm can correctly detect the attack behavior of the collected videos.",

Arc GIS and ERDAS Imagine 15 softwarewere used for image pre-processing in order to stack the layers, sub-set them, and mosaic the satellitebands. After pre-processing the photos, a maximum likelihood technique was used in a supervisedimage classification scheme to identify the land-use changes that had been noticed in the research area.The goal of the current study was. In 2010, there were 9.6 km2 under water. By 2015, there were 21.04km2, and by 2020, there were 19.4 km2. In 2010, there were 16.6 km2 of built-up land; this numberrose to 19.4 km2 in 2015 and 26.8 km2 in 2020. The total area covered by vegetation was estimated tobe 513.2 km2 in 2010, 601.6 km2 in 2015, and 717.7 km2 in 2020. The area covered by forest land usedeclined with time, from 90.8 km2 in 2010 to 86.7 km2 in 2015 to 61.84 km2 in 2020, indicating adownward trend. The area used for bare land in 2010 was 528.54 km2, which significantly reduced to429.64 km2 in 2015 and then to 333.1 km2 in 2020. The area of arid terrain that was once used foragriculture has dramatically shrunk. The results of this research will be beneficial for future land-useplanning, urban and regional development, and a growth in agricultural production of different crops inthe study area.",

In addition, machine learning has been applied in various areas, including disease diagnosis, patient risk classification, customized treatment suggestions, and drug development. Machine learning algorithms can scrutinize vast quantities of data from electronic health records, medical images, and other sources to identify patterns and make predictions, which can support healthcare professionals and experts in making better-informed decisions, enhancing patient care, and determining a patient's health status. In this regard, the author opted to compare the performance of three algorithms (logistic regression, Adaboost, and naïve bayes) through the correct classification rate for diabetes prediction in order to ensure the effectiveness of accurate diagnosis. The dataset applied in this work is obtained from the Vanderbilt university institutional repository and is publicly available data. The study determined that three algorithms are very effective at prediction. Mainly, logistic regression and Adaboost had a classification rate above 92%, and the naive bayes algorithm achieved a classification rate above 90%.",

The research has following steps: (i) to value the suitable land for cropland with basic condition (constraint mapping) (ii) to value the suitable land with Multi-criteria (factor mapping) analysis; iii) to check the integrated suitability assessment image with confusion matrix. Basic condition or constraint map is drawn with Boolean logic method. Weighted value for analysis had been calculated using “ranking hierarchy\". Weighted linear model are used for it. Cropland factors hierarchy is sorted out through pair wais comparison technique. The relative weight is calculated using analytical hierarchy processing (AHP) method for sorting factors based on previous researches and shows following values: S=organic matter*0.36+ (A+B) horizon*0.22+ soil texture*0.16 + slope*0.08+ soil moisture*0.06+ altitude*0.04+ soil stoniness* 0.02+ exch. bases* 0.02 + pH*0.02. To check the accuracy and agreement the field study materials archived in 1989-2009 and performed model map had been used in confusion matrix evaluation. It could be concluded that suitability map is prpcessed somewhat correct according to the result of overall accuracy 0.83, matched cells 72-95% and Kappa coefficient 0.8 results. Correspondingly the places modeled for an exploration area for the cropland was matched to the current location of agricultural land possessions.",

        "abstract": "When applying classifiers in real applications, the data imbalance often occurs when the number of elements of one class is greater than another. The article examines the estimates of the classification results for this type of data. The paper provides answers to three questions: which term is a more accurate translation of the phrase \"confusion matrix\", how preferable to represent data in this matrix, and what functions to be better used to evaluate the results of classification by such a matrix. The paper demonstrates on real data that the popular accuracy function cannot correctly estimate the classification errors for imbalanced data. It is also impossible to compare the values of this function, calculated by matrices with absolute quantitative results of classification and normalized by classes. If the data is imbalanced, the accuracy calculated from the confusion matrix with normalized values will usually have lower values, since it is calculated by a different formula. The same conclusion is made for most of the classification accuracy functions used in the literature for estimation of classification results. It is shown that to represent confusion matrices it is better to use absolute values of object distribution by classes instead of relative ones, since they give an idea of the amount of data tested for each class and their imbalance. When constructing classifiers, it is recommended to evaluate errors by functions that do not depend on the data imbalance, that allows to hope for more correct classification results for real data.",

The important role of confusion matrices in enhancing the precision of spellcheckers, particularly within the diverse linguistic context of the Croatian language, is investigated. Common causes of spelling errors, emphasizing the challenges posed by diacritic usage, have been identified and analyzed. This research contributes to the advancement of spellchecking technologies and provides a more comprehensive understanding of linguistic details, particularly in languages with diacritic-rich orthographies, like Croatian.

In ‘trade mark infringement cases in order to establish liability, a plaintiff must establish that there is a likelihood of confusion between the junior user’s mark and the senior user’s mark. . . Most cases involve confusion at the point of sale’. However two other variants have also been recognised by courts. This chapter reviews the authorities which establish liability for confusion (1) that occurs prior to a purchase transaction and which may even be corrected before the transaction occurs, or (2) is generated by the use of a sign in relation to a product after its purchase. The former is referred to as initial interest confusion while the latter is known as post-sale confusion. While seemingly presented as a question of timing—when is the relevant consumer confused? —each variant more fundamentally relates to the presence or absence of meaningful harm to the trade mark owner.",

If the essential function of a trade mark is to reliably indicate the commercial origin of a product in the marketplace, an action to prevent confusion amongst consumers, thereby impeding this origin indicating ability, is a necessary corollary. The language of Article 5(1)(b) (relative grounds) and Article 10(2)(b) (infringement) of the Trade Marks Directive 2015 (TMD 2015) indicates that the proprietor has the right to prevent a junior user from registering or using a mark where ‘because of its identity with, or similarity to, the earlier trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by the trade marks, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public; the likelihood of confusion includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade mark’.",

As a cause of action, it has something to offer everyone: trade mark owners are protected from those trying to reap the benefits of their investment in their mark and brand, the public interest is served because consumers are protected from making mistaken purchasing decisions, and consequently, a differentiated market for goods and services can operate. The prevention of confusion also has intuitive appeal. We have all been confused; policymakers, judges, academics, practitioners, and members of the public alike. Indeed, we have probably all made erroneous decisions in the marketplace. Yet, despite (or perhaps because of) the ease with which likely confusion provides the traditional rationale for trade mark protection, it is under-analysed and under-studied. In particular, it is our belief that the very intuitiveness of confusion has resulted in little systematic analysis considering the exact ingredients that make up a claim of confusion.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study proposes the novel concept of hierarchical confusion matrix, opening the door for popular confusion-matrix-based (flat) evaluation measures from binary classification problems, while considering the peculiarities of hierarchical classification problems. The concept is developed to a generalised form and proven its applicability to all types of hierarchical classification problems including directed acyclic graphs, multi-path labelling, and non-mandatory leaf-node prediction. Finally, measures based on the novel confusion matrix are used for three real-world hierarchical classification applications and compared to established evaluation measures. The results, the conformity with important attributes of hierarchical classification schemes and its broad applicability justify its recommendation.",

        "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the long-standing debate over the quest to achieve goals about social relationships via the neighborhood. Earlier in the 20th century, it was common for neighborhood proponents to ascribe social outcomes to neighborhoods in the hope that social connection—and at times, conformity—could be instilled, if only neighborhoods were of a particular form. Later in the century, communications and transportation technologies dealt a further blow to the idea that neighborhoods were a viable source for instilling social outcomes like a sense of belonging and a sense of community. The social prescriptions of neighborhood form have long been problematized, but the argument seems to linger on, fueling critics of neighborhood plans. The most promising avenue for resolving this entrenched debate is to reject outright social relationship–related claims, refocus attention on neighborhood functionality—services, facilities, and institutions—and welcome whatever positive social benefits might be derived.",

        "abstract": "Based on claim submission data from year 2019 to 2021 can be seen that the percentage of claims in one province is much higher than other provinces. During that period, the percentage of claims in that province reached 22% while the highest percentage in other provinces was only 6%. It is suspected that there has been a claim fraud in the province. The fraud allegedly started when customer submits a policy issuance for the elderly insured with a low sum insured so that the premium is also low. The insured's health condition at that time may not be good but it is not explained in the insurance application letter. To increase the sum insured, the policy is usually added with additional coverage. Fraud claim creates big loss for insurance company since the company has to pay the claim that they should not pay. Insurance company need to have a mechanism to avoid the fraud claim. From this research, it is expected to find the best methodology to be able to predict the potential of insurance claim fraud early when customers apply for policy issuance so that additional checks can be carried out for suspected submissions. The initial data available for this research is 14,778 claim records with attributes are : the date of claim submission, policy effective date, sum assured, type of claim, cause of claim, province and fraud. In order to get the best methodology on the accuracy and performance aspect to fulfill the expectation, two methodologies (Naïve Bayes and K-NN) are compared. Both Naive Bayes and K-NN methods are used with a comparison of training data and testing data is 80:20. Several combinations were performed for each of these methods. By using Confusion Matrix and AUC to measure the accuracy and performance of the two methods, it can be concluded that the best one is Naive Bayes with accuracy is 90% and AUC is 0.761. The attributes used are province, sum assured, additional coverage and the insured is the policy holder.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, corner detection algorithms have been proposed by several researchers who described them contrarily, depending on their respective viewpoints to obtain the data and information as a human eye does. Basically, no researchers have come up with a technique to compare corner detectors with another’s. Thus, this study proposed to adapt the confusion matrix technique as a performance measure for corner detectors. The judgement accuracy of every corner detector will only be pleased if the actual corner points are already known. Therefore, this study is attracted to explore the accuracy of corner detectors, namely the Global and Local Curvature Scale space (GLCSS), Affine Resilient Curvature Scale Space (ARCSS), and Harris. These corner detectors were analysed using the nine characters selected from Jawi, Chinese, and Tamil characters, three characters each, respectively. This study specifically detected the true corners for these characters using the determined corner detectors. The actual corner of all these characters was confirmed through a survey of twenty respondents. The majority of marked corners by respondents were considered actual corner points. Then, the input image for all characters was converted into a grayscale image. Every image will undergo pre-processing step, the process of boundary extraction using Canny edge detector. Thus, the edge image was extracted to get the corner point by applying the corner detectors, and the corner point detected was marked on that image. Above and beyond, the study aims to introduce a confusion matrix approach as a performance measure to carry out the most outstanding algorithm in detecting the true corner points for all the tested characters. From the evaluation, GLCSS and Harris algorithms have shown good accuracy. Henceforth, the study is not trying to judge the goodness of each corner detector but only to introduce confusion matrix as a tool that can be considered to measure the performance of the corner detector.",

The likelihood of confusion test has in turn been influenced by this history. This chapter describes the manner in which a test developed around a template of traditional marks can be extended to disputes involving colours, shapes, and other less conventional marks. Such disputes inevitably raise novel issues. For instance, when may the defendant’s use of a colour on their products be construed as trade mark use, instead of merely incidental or decorative use? And how are courts to assess the similarity of colours, bearing in mind that consumers are deemed to have imperfect recollection? More pertinently, can such consumers distinguish between two shades of the same colour? Can two product shapes be sufficiently visually similar to satisfy the test, despite prominent and dissimilar word marks also being present on the products?",

        "abstract": "Conformity assessment refers to activities undertaken to check whether some product, service or process meets certain criteria and specifications given by internationally accepted standards. The decision on whether a property of interest is aligned with the set standards is made based on measurement. However, uncertainty associated with the measurement results may lead to incorrect decisions. Measurement results may be falsely rejected as non-conforming, although they meet specifications. This is referred to as the producer’s risk. If the measurement result that does not meet the required specifications is accepted as conforming, this is referred to as the consumer’s risk. This paper covers calculations of global consumer's and producer's risk using the Bayesian approach and deals with the application of metrics related to confusion matrices in conformity assessments. These techniques have been used to assess the conformity of the bearing ring diameter with the given specifications. Based on the behavior of these metrics, the optimal length of the guard band was determined with the aim of minimizing the global consumer’s and producer’s risk.",

A representative set of conditions should be included in simulation studies. However, several recently published Monte Carlo simulation studies have not included the conditions of the null distribution of the statistic in their evaluations or comparisons of statistics and, therefore, have drawn incorrect conclusions. This present study proposes a design based on a common statistic evaluation procedure in psychology and machine learning, using a confusion matrix with four cells: true positive, true negative, false negative modified, and false positive modified. To illustrate this design, we employ an influential Monte Carlo simulation study by Trizano-Hermosilla and Alvarado (2016), which concluded that the Omega-indexed internal consistency should be preferred over other alternatives. Our results show that Omega can report an acceptable level of internal consistency (i.e., &gt; 0.7) in a population with no relationship between every two items in some conditions, providing novel empirical evidence for comparing internal consistency indices.",

The linguistic diversity of Oaxaca, the most extreme anywhere on the planet, combined with the tonal complexity of the Otomangue languages spoken by the great majority of the local population, served as a serious barrier to achieving this goal. The existence of over twenty distinct languages, and a plethora of individual dialects within them, stimulated the further spread of Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, as a lingua franca between Spaniards and Indians throughout the colony. Its failure to reach across all social strata and ethnicities led the missionaries to conclude that they would have to proselytize directly in all the indigenous languages despite their multiplicity and complexity.",

        "abstract": "AbstractEvaluating binary classifications is a pivotal task in statistics and machine learning, because it can influence decisions in multiple areas, including for example prognosis or therapies of patients in critical conditions. The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The results of microarray data analysis is important in cancer diagnosis, especially in early stages asymptomatic cancers like ovarian cancer. One of the challenges in analyzing microarray data is the problem of imbalanced data. Unfortunately, research that carries out cancer classification from microarray data often ignores this challenge, so that it doesn’t use appropriate evaluation metrics. It makes the results biased towards the majority class. This study uses a popular evaluation metric “accuracy” and an evaluation metric that is suitable for imbalanced data “balanced accuracy (BA)” to gain information from the confusion matrix regarding accuracy and BA values in case of ovarian cancer classification.Methods: This study use Classification and Regression Tree (CART) as the classifier. CART optimized by pruning. CART optimal is determined from the results of CART complexity analysis and confusion matrix.Results: The confusion matrix and CART interpretations in this research show that CART with low complexity is still able to predict majority class respondents well. However, when none of the data in the minority class was classified correctly, the accuracy value was still quite high, namely 86.97% and 88.03% respectively at the training and testing stages, while the BA value at both stages was only 50%.Novelty: It is very important to ensure that the evaluation metrics used match the characteristics of the data being processed. This research illustrate the difference between accuracy and BA. It concluded that that classification of an imbalanced dataset without doing resampling can use BA as evaluation metric, because based on the results, BA is more fairly to both classes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis research aims to test the ability to capture malicious e-mail objects, spam e-mails, phishing e-mails, or malware e-mails on Proofpoint Email Protection and Fortimail antispam devices to prevent security threats to PT. XYZ. Email service was one of the primary services for an agency or company in providing electronic mail that could be used to exchange official information. The study was conducted by comparing two antispam devices of Proofpoint and Fortimail. The test was conducted sequentially within three months period on each device. Those devices were configured using the infrastructure of PT. XYZ. Besides comparing the functions or features of each device, device testing was also done on overcoming the problem of email security threats such as spoofing, impostor, and bulk email that often threaten email infrastructure. To measure the accuracy of the results of the two devices, we use the Confusion Matrix method to measure the performance of the classification system. As the result, the slights differences inaccuracy were the indication that the ability of each antispam device was not too far. A large number of spam emails which caught through antispam devices were illustrated that PT. XYZ had become the target of spam, phishing, and malware attack. For this reason, anti-spam device technology was needed to maintain the quality of PT. XYZ email service.",

        "abstract": "Pandemi COVID-19 memberikan dampak diberbagai aspek. Salah satu yang terkena dampak adalah transportasi umum. Transportasi umum mengalami penurunan jumlah penumpang yang signifikan, seperti Transjakarta sebesar 34,52%, MRT  94,11%  dan KRL 78,69%. Penurunan ini disebabkan oleh kebijakan yang dikeluarkan untuk mendukung upaya pemerintah dalam pencegahan penyebaran virus Covid-19, seperti memangkas jam operasional, mengurangi perjalanan yang akan dijadwalkan sampai pembatasan penumpang setiap gerbong. Kebijakan ini memicu opini penumpang mengenai pelayanan yang diberikan. Opini tersebut dapat dituangkan melalui berbagai media salah satunya Twitter. Opini penumpang yang tertuang didalam twitter mengenai pelayanan transportasi umum dapat bersifat positif atau pun negatif. Opini penumpang dapat digunakan sebagai data dalam melakukan analisis sentimen, data ini dapat diperoleh dengan menggunakan teknik crawling. Analisis sentimen dilakukan untuk mengetahui kecenderungan opini penumpang mengenai pelayanan transportasi umum selama pandemi Covid-19. Data yang didapatkan sebanyak 650 data yang diberikan label positif dan negatif. Data dibagi menjadi data latih sebanyak 60 % atau 390 data, dan data uji 40% atau 260 data. Data ini dapat digunakan untuk proses pembuatan model mechine learning menggunakan Metode algoritma Naïve Bayes Classifier. Hasil pembentukan model mechine learning ini memiliki tingkat akurasi sebesar 83,8%  yang dihasilkan dari pengujian data uji dengan menggunakan confusion matrix.",

        "abstract": "The proposed new method for accuracy assessment of image classification in UAV-based Remote Sensing can be applied in solution of different ecological and practical tasks. Nowadays thematic maps play an important role in solution of different remote sensing tasks. Thematic maps are applied for forest classification, determing of soil types and properties, environmental monitoring, exploring of oil and gas. That’s why the accuracy assessment is necessary to evaluate the quality of thematic maps. It is important to know the accuracy of thematic maps before they are used for further scientific investigations. Users and producers of maps compare several maps to see which is best, or to check how well they agree. It was proposed to use Weighted confusion matrix for accuracy assessment of thematic maps. Proposed Weighted confusion matrix was considered with Confusion matrix. It was noted, that Confusion matrix needs in large samples and can not take into account the “seriousness” of errors. It also were shown main advantages of Weighted confusion matrix. It was noted, that Weighted confusion matrix gives different weights for different mistakes of classification. Proposed Weighted confusion matrix gives a partial credit for classification results. This property of the Weighted confusion matrix is very important, when not all mistakes are equally serious and rough for user. Proposed method uses the Weights matrix for Confusion matrix that contains weights for each element in the Confusion matrix. Accuracy coefficient of the Weighted confusion matrix, such as: Overall accuracy, User’s accuracy, Producer’s accuracy and Weighted average of the weights for each class and their main properties were described in this work too. It was also considered a numerical example of calculation of accuracy coefficients of Weighted confusion matrix. This proposed new method for accuracy assessment of image classification can be applied in land-cover classification, environmental monitoring, exploring for minerals, numerous agricultural tasks.",

        "abstract": "The classification method is part of data mining which is used to predict existing problems and also as predictions for the future. The form of dataset used in the classification method is supervised data. The random forest classification method is processed by forming several decision trees and then combining them to get better and more precise predictions. while a decision tree is the concept of changing a pile of data into a decision tree that presents the rules of a decision. From these two classification methods, researchers will compare the level of accuracy of predictions from both methods with the same dataset, namely the employee dataset in India, to predict the level of accuracy of employees who leave their jobs or still remain to work at their company. The number of records available is 4654 records. Of the existing data, 90% was used as training data and 10% was used as test data. From the results of testing this method, it was found that the accuracy level of the random forest method was 86.45%, while the decision tree method was 84.30% accuracy level. Then, by using the confusion matrix, you can see the magnitude of the distribution of experimental validity visually to calculate precision, recall and F1-Score. The random forest algorithm obtained precision of: 96.7%, sensitivity of: 84.7%, specificity of: 91.4%, and F1-Score of: 90.2%. Meanwhile, the decision tree algorithm obtained precision of: 95.7%, sensitivity of: 82.9%, specificity of: 88.4%, and F1-Score of: 88.8%.",
