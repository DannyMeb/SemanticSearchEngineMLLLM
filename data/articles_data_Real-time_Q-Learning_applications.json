        "abstract": "This paper proposes and develops 'LINCALL,' a real-time voice processing and machine learning system designed to provide preemptive emotional protection for emotional laborers working in environments such as call centers. LINCALL analyzes voice data in real-time conversations with customers to understand their emotional states, converting this data into text for analysis. The system identifies keywords and offers appropriate questions and answers, aiding emotional laborers in handling customer interactions more effectively. It also includes a feature for responding appropriately to the customer's emotional state, such as voice blocking. Additionally, the automatic voice-to-text conversion feature reduces fatigue for emotional laborers, enhances the efficiency of consultations, and aids in preemptive emotional protection for emotional laborers.",

        "abstract": "The use of automated technology has the potential to enhance road safety and prevent fatalities. A new approach for detecting the presence of a child in a car's front seat using image processing techniques can prevent accidents caused by children being in the front seat. By analyzing images from a surveillance camera, we can identify the location and analyze pixel values using machine learning algorithms to determine if a child is present in the image. This technology can help prevent severe accidents caused by leaving children in the front seat of a car. Our goal is to develop an AI-based deep learning algorithm that can detect children in the front seat of a car by analyzing various features of the child and classifying them as either a child or adult. This algorithm will also be used to detect the presence of people in the car and monitor the street, automatically sending traffic violation information to the driver. Our training dataset had 2,624 images, the validation dataset had 254 images, and the testing dataset had 316 images. We achieved a training accuracy of 97%, a validation accuracy of 95.67%, and a testing accuracy of 86%. The classification report is displayed in the figure provided.",

        "abstract": "AbstractAutomated nucleus segmentation is considered the gold standard for diagnosing some severe diseases. Accurate instance segmentation of nuclei is still very challenging because of the large number of clustered nuclei, and the different appearance of nuclei for different tissue types. In this paper, a neural network is proposed for fast and accurate instance segmentation of nuclei in histopathology images. The network is inspired by the Unet and residual nets. The main contribution of the proposed model is enhancing the classification accuracy of nuclear boundaries by moderately preserving the spatial features by relatively d the size of feature maps. Then, a proposed 2D convolution layer is used instead of the conventional 3D convolution layer, the core of CNN-based architectures, where the feature maps are first compacted before being convolved by 2D kernel filters. This significantly reduces the processing time and avoids the out of memory problem of the GPU. Also, more features are extracted when getting deeper into the network without degrading the spatial features dramatically. Hence, the number of layers, required to compensate the loss of spatial features, is reduced that also reduces the processing time. The proposed approach is applied to two multi-organ datasets and evaluated by the Aggregated Jaccard Index (AJI), F1-score and the number of frames per second. Also, the formula of AJI is modified to reflect the object- and pixel-level errors more accurately. The proposed model is compared to some state-of-the-art architectures, and it shows better performance in terms of the segmentation speed and accuracy.",

This explorer nation has now been prefabbed with earth-shattering enhancements due to its value in speedy real-world applications. However, conventional approaches utilizing unfiltered benchmarks show their incapacity to handle higher levels of variance in such unrestricted photographs. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enabled approaches have recently been widely used during categorization tasks due to their superior performance in facial psychotherapy. Dimension extraction and categorization are both components of the two-level CNN framework. The article extraction process extracts characteristics such as age and sexual identity, while the classification technique assigns the play photographs to the appropriate age and gender groups. We propose a ground-breaking end-to-end CNN swing in this implementation to achieve better and healthier age units and sexuality categorization of unfiltered real-world faces. We use a bulky person pretreatment approach to prepare and process the unfiltered real-world faces before they are input into the CNN poser in order to handle the significant discrepancies in those faces. When tested for sorting accuracy on the synoptical OIUAudience benchmark, an experimental result reveals that with us assistance achieves state-of-the-art achievement in both age gathering and gender arrangement. Our web is pretrained on an IMDb-WIKI with chanting labels, then fine-tuned on MORPH-II, and eventually on the OIUAudience (first) dataset's training set. In comparison to the best-reported results, the classification of age groups is improved by an excellent percentage (exact accuracy) and a very high percentage (validation accuracy), while the classification of genders is improved by an excellent percentage (exact correctness) and 93.42 percent (validation accuracy).",

Technology is needed to prevent lone-wolf attacks without human supervision. Hence designing an automatic weapon detection using deep learning, is an optimized solution to localize and detect the presence of weapon objects using Neural Networks. This research focuses on both unified and II-stage object detectors whose resultant model not only detects the presence of weapons but also classifies with respective to its weapon classes, including handgun, knife, revolver, and rifle, along with person detection. This research focuses on YOLOv5 (You Look Only Once) family and Faster RCNN family for model validation and training. Pruning and Ensembling techniques were applied to YOLOv5 to enhance their speed and performance. YOLOv5 models achieve the highest score of 78% with an inference speed of 8.1ms. However, Faster R-CNN models achieve the highest AP 89%.",

        "abstract": "AbstractImage dehazing methods can restore clean images from hazy images and are popularly used as a preprocessing step to improve performance in various image analysis tasks. In recent times, deep learning-based methods have been used to sharply increase the visual quality of restored images, but they require a long computation time. The processing time of image-dehazing methods is one of the important factors to be considered in order not to affect the latency of the main image analysis tasks such as detection and segmentation. We propose an end-to-end network model for real-time image dehazing. We devised a zoomed convolution group that processes computation-intensive operations with low resolution to decrease the processing time of the network model without performance degradation. Additionally, the zoomed convolution group adopts an efficient channel attention module to improve the performance of the network model. Thus, we designed a network model using a zoomed convolution group to progressively recover haze-free images using a coarse-to-fine strategy. By adjusting the sampling ratio and the number of convolution blocks that make up the convolution group, we distributed small and large computational complexities respectively in the early and later operational stages. The experimental results with the proposed method on a public dataset showed a real-time performance comparable to that of another state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. The proposed network’s peak-signal-to-noise ratio was 0.8 dB lower than that of the SOTA method, but the processing speed was 10.4 times faster.",

In the past few years, terrorism has exploded in Burkina Faso, affecting education, national security, health, and the economy. There is a great need for solutions to detect and stop terrorist attacks before they occur. This research project seeks to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mine social media and detect probable future terrorist attacks. This article describes the design of a framework, its partial implementation, and an experiment to validate the technique. The system consists of five steps: taking social media as input, converting it to text, validating it, extracting essential information, predicting its class, and storing it in a dataset. The modest size of the manually produced dataset utilized in the original experiment is a key drawback of the work discussed in this research. The modest size proved inconvenient for Deep Learning algorithms, which operate best with massive datasets. When we complete the entire system, inserting increased data from social media into the dataset will resolve this limitation. The other limitation is the partial implementation of the framework, which does not provide a comprehensive picture of the proposed approach. Our future works will address the remainder parts of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "AbstractTechnological advances in embedded systems and the advent of fog computing led to improved quality of service of applications of cyber-physical systems. In fact, the deployment of such applications on powerful and heterogeneous embedded systems, such as multiprocessors system-on-chips (MPSoCs), allows them to meet latency requirements and real-time operation. Highly relevant to the industry and our reference case-study, the challenging field of nuclear fusion deploys the aforementioned applications, involving high-frequency control with hard real-time and safety constraints. The use of fog computing and MPSoCs is promising to achieve safety, low latency, and timeliness of such control. Indeed, on one hand, applications designed according to fog computing distribute computation across hierarchically organized and geographically distributed edge devices, enabling timely anomaly detection during high-frequency sampling of time series, and, on the other hand, MPSoCs allow leveraging fog computing and integrating monitoring by deploying tasks on a flexible platform suited for mixed-criticality software, leading to so-called mixed criticality systems (MCSs). However, the integration of such software on the same MPSoC opens challenges related to predictability and reliability guarantees, as tasks interfering with each other when accessing the same shared MPSoC resources may introduce non-deterministic latency, possibly leading to failures on account of deadline overruns. Addressing the design, deployment, and evaluation of MCSs on MPSoCs, we propose a model-based system development process that facilitates the integration of real-time and monitoring software on the same platform by means of a formal notation for modeling the design and deployment of MPSoCs. The proposed notation allows developers to leverage embedded hypervisors for monitoring real-time applications and guaranteeing predictability by isolation of hardware resources. Providing evidence of the feasibility of our system development process and evaluating the industry-relevant class of nuclear fusion applications, we experiment with a safety-critical case-study in the context of the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. Our experimentation involves the design and evaluation of several prototypes deployed as MCSs on a virtualized MPSoC, showing that deployment choices linked to the monitor placement and virtualization configurations (e.g., resource allocation, partitioning, and scheduling policies) can significantly impact the predictability of MCSs in terms of Worst-Case Execution Times and other related metrics.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn a previous study, we reported the development of a bit-agnostic AI deep learning wear model and showed the successful real-time deployments in multiple field bit runs. To test AI/DL model robustness and transformability, we extended the AI/DL model to another similar hard drilling application with different hole sizes, BHAs, bit designs, and lithology. The model robustness is successfully tested using a smaller dataset of subsurface logging and surface drilling data.\nAI/DL bit wear model employs an unsupervised bi-directional Long short-term Memory-based Variational Autoencoder (biLSTM-VAE) to project raw drilling and formation logging data into a lower-dimensional latent space. XGboost classifier is used to predict real-time bit-wear in the pre-trained latent space. Physics-based input feature engineering is conducted to extract meaningful information from the raw data. To test the model robustness when transferring to a different drilling application, only Gamma logging data and a smaller offset training dataset is applied. The deep neural network was trained in an unsupervised manner and the bit-wear estimation is an end-to-end process.\nAI/DL wear model was trained on twenty offset bit runs. To test the model robustness, different hole sizes and BHAs were selected in addition to bit design and lithology changes. Unsupervised training results show biLSTM-VAE model successfully extracted bit wear features and clustered bit states in the latent space. Bit wear estimation using XGboost matches with the field results for the test dataset. In the previous real-time study, Gamma ray, density and porosity loggings were used in AI/DL model for downhole formation interpretation. The model robustness test in this study demonstrates the AI/DL model can be applied to applications with only Gamma data. BHA feature testing suggests separate AI/DL models need to be trained for RSS and motorized RSS systems.\nAI model robustness and transformability is crucial for the success of AI model field deployments. The model robustness test in this study shows encoding drilling data into a lower dimensional space through unsupervised learnings could improve the model robustness and overcome offset training data quality issue. AI/DL results suggest exploratory data analysis of input drilling features such as BHAs and formation loggings is important for the model accuracy.",

        "abstract": "AbstractFor target detection tasks in complicated backgrounds, a deep learning-based radar target detection method is suggested to address the problems of a high false alarm rate and the difficulties of achieving high-performance detection by conventional methods. Considering the issues of large parameter count and memory occupation of the deep learning-based target detection models, a lightweight target detection method based on improved YOLOv4-tiny is proposed. The technique applies depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and bottleneck architecture (BA) to the YOLOv4-tiny network. Moreover, it introduces the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the improved feature fusion network. It allows the network to be lightweight while ensuring detection accuracy. We choose a certain number of pulses from the pulse-compressed radar data for clutter suppression and Doppler processing to obtain range–Doppler (R–D) images. Experiments are run on the R–D two-dimensional echo images, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can quickly and accurately detect dim radar targets against complicated backgrounds. Compared with other algorithms, our approach is more balanced regarding detection accuracy, model size, and detection speed.",

FER is attracting increasing attention for its role in improving the convenience in human life. It is widely applied in human–computer interaction tasks. However, recently, FER tasks have encountered certain data and training issues. To address these issues in FER, few-shot learning (FSL) has been researched as a new approach. In this paper, we focus on analyzing FER techniques based on FSL and consider the computational complexity and processing time in these models. FSL has been researched as it can solve the problems of training with few datasets and generalizing in a wild-environmental condition. Based on our analysis, we describe certain existing challenges in the use of FSL in FER systems and suggest research directions to resolve these issues. FER using FSL can be time efficient and reduce the complexity in many other real-time processing tasks and is an important area for further research.",

        "abstract": "The integration of Deep Learning (DL) models with the HoloLens2 Augmented Reality (AR) headset has enormous potential for real-time AR medical applications. Currently, most applications execute the models on an external server that communicates with the headset via Wi-Fi. This client-server architecture introduces undesirable delays and lacks reliability for real-time applications. However, due to HoloLens2’s limited computation capabilities, running the DL model directly on the device and achieving real-time performances is not trivial. Therefore, this study has two primary objectives: (i) to systematically evaluate two popular frameworks to execute DL models on HoloLens2—Unity Barracuda and Windows Machine Learning (WinML)—using the inference time as the primary evaluation metric; (ii) to provide benchmark values for state-of-the-art DL models that can be integrated in different medical applications (e.g., Yolo and Unet models). In this study, we executed DL models with various complexities and analyzed inference times ranging from a few milliseconds to seconds. Our results show that Unity Barracuda is significantly faster than WinML (p-value < 0.005). With our findings, we sought to provide practical guidance and reference values for future studies aiming to develop single, portable AR systems for real-time medical assistance.",

        "abstract": " In order to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and influenza, an effective protection method is to wear facial masks in densely populated areas. This has led to a growing need for smart services that automatically detect facial masks and replace manual reminding. To address this challenging task and to contribute towards health safety, this paper introduces MedNetV2 system, which is an efficient deep learning-based facial mask detector with a low computational cost. In comparison with existing systems, the main specificities of the proposed system are: (1) the adoption of an effective deep learning-based framework to deal with both the large scale diversity and position variations of masked faces involved in natural scenes, (2) the interaction between face localization and facial mask detection modules to achieve the overall system goal, (3) the lightweight design and the real-time response well suited for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public dataset and real-world video streaming are carried out to validate quantitatively and visually the effectiveness of the proposed system. Promising results, in terms of detection accuracy as well as time response, are achieved when compared it with other state-of-the-art systems. ",

        "abstract": "Sustainable energy development requires environment-friendly energy-generating methods. Pricing system constraints influence the efficient use of energy resources. Real-Time Pricing (RTP) is theoretically superior to previous pricing systems for allowing demand response (DR) activities. The DR approach has been useful for correcting supply–demand imbalances as technology has evolved. There are several systems for determining and controlling the DR. However, most of these solutions are unable to control rising demand or forecast prices for future time slots. This research provides a Real-Time Pricing DR model for energy management based on deep learning, where the learning framework is trained on demand response and real-time pricing. The study data in this article were taken from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), and the learning framework was trained over 17 years of data to forecast the real future energy price and demand. To investigate the suggested deep learning-based dynamic pricing strategy, two prediction instances are addressed: actual–predicted demand and actual–predicted price. We estimated pricing and demand outcomes using long short-term memory (LSTM), which were then greatly improved by architectural changes in the model. The findings showed that the suggested model is suitable for energy management in terms of demand and price prediction.",

        "abstract": "Haze which can be created by natural or synthetic factors, degrades the visual quality and human sight distance. Visible objects become invisible or scarcely visible. The physics of the degrading function due to haze has been modelled by Atmospheric Light Scattering (ALS) Model. Therefore, from a single hazy image, by using proper methods, it is possible to recover the original scene. In dehazing methods, which solve the ALS function, there are basically two steps: First one is the estimation of the air light present at the time of the image capturing and the second one is the estimation of transmission of the corresponding scene. One of the most effective method which is used for air light estimation is QuadTree decomposition. For this method, tests show that the most amount of the dehazing time is consumed to estimate the air light. For the case of High Definition (HD) imagery, the estimation of air light consumes huge time. Therefore, it cannot be possible to achieve a real-time or near real-time dehazing on traditional hardware. In this study, a novel convolutional neural network model is developed to estimate the air light directly from the hazy image quickly. The estimated air light then is used with Atmospheric Light Scattering model to handle the recovered image. Results show that the time cost is reduced by 56.0% and 65% for image resolutions of (640x480) and (1920x1080) compared to the QuadTree Decomposition method used in ALS based dehazing methods, without losing the visual quality of the dehazed image.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDiagnosis of autism considers a challenging task for medical experts since the medical diagnosis mainly depends on the abnormalities in the brain functions that may not appear in the early stages of early onset of autism disorder. Facial expression can be an alternative and efficient solution for the early diagnosis of Autism. This is due to Autistic children usually having distinctive patterns which facilitate distinguishing them from normal children. Assistive technology has proven to be one of the most important innovations in helping people with autism improve their quality of life. A real-time emotion identification system for autistic youngsters was developed in this study. Face identification, facial feature extraction, and feature categorization are the three stages of emotion recognition. A total of six facial emotions are detected by the propound system: anger, fear, joy, natural, sadness, and surprise. This section proposes an enhanced deep learning (EDL) technique to classify the emotions using convolutional neural network. The proposed emotion detection framework takes the benefit from using fog and IoT to reduce the latency for real-time detection with fast response and to be a location awareness. From the results, EDL outperforms other techniques as it achieved 99.99% accuracy. EDL used GA to select the optimal hyperparameters for the CNN.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWebsite Uniform Resource Locator (URL) spoofing remains one of the ways of perpetrating phishing attacks in the twenty-first century. Hackers continue to employ URL spoofing to deceive naïve and unsuspecting consumers into releasing important personal details in malicious websites. Blacklists and rule-based filters that were once effective at reducing the risks and sophistication of phishing are no longer effective as there are over 1.5 million new phishing websites created monthly. Therefore, research aimed at unveiling new techniques for detecting phishing websites has sparked a lot of interest in both academics and business with machine and deep learning techniques being at the forefront. Among the deep learning techniques that have been employed, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) remains one of the most widely used with high performance in feature learning. However, CNN has a problem of memorizing contextual relationships in URL text, which makes it challenging to efficiently detect sophisticated malicious URLs in real-time applications. On the contrary, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model has been successfully employed in complex real-time problems because of its ability to store inputs for a long period of time. This study experiments with the use of hybrid CNN and LSTM deep learning models for spoofing website URL detection in order to exploit the combined strengths of the two approaches for a more sophisticated spoofing URL detection. Two publicly available datasets (UCL spoofing Website and PhishTank Datasets) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid model against other models in the literature. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieved accuracies of 98.9% and 96.8%, respectively, when evaluated using the UCL and PhishTank datasets. On the other hand, the standalone CNN and LSTM achieved accuracies of 90.4% and 94.6% on the UCL dataset, while their accuracies on the PhishTank dataset were 89.3% and 92.6%, respectively. The results show that the hybrid CNN-LSTM algorithm largely outperformed the standalone CNN and LSTM models, which demonstrates a much better performance. Therefore, the hybrid deep learning technique is recommended for detecting spoofing website URL thereby reducing losses attributed to such attacks.",
