        "abstract": "Gesture recognition is a pivotal technology in the realm of intelligent education, and millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals possess advantages such as high resolution and strong penetration capability. This paper introduces a highly accurate and robust gesture recognition method using mmWave radar. The method involves capturing the raw signals of hand movements with the mmWave radar module and preprocessing the received radar signals, including Fourier transformation, distance compression, Doppler processing, and noise reduction through moving target indication (MTI). The preprocessed signals are then fed into the Convolutional Neural Network-Time Domain Convolutional Network (CNN-TCN) model to extract spatio-temporal features, with recognition performance evaluated through classification. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves an accuracy rate of 98.2% in domain-specific recognition and maintains a consistently high recognition rate across different neural networks, showcasing exceptional recognition performance and robustness",

        "abstract": "UmeedVR aims to create a conversational therapy VR game using natural language processing for patients with Speech Disorders like Autism or Aphasia. This study developed 5 psychological task sets and 3 environments via Maya and Unity. The Topic-Modeling AI, employing 25 live participants' recordings and 980+ TwineAI datasets, generated initial VR grading with a coherence score averaging 6.98 themes in 5-minute conversations across scenarios, forming a foundation for enhancements. Employing latent semantic analysis (gensimcorpus Python) and Term-Frequency-Inverse Document-Frequency (TF-IDF), grammatical errors and user-specific improvements were addressed. Results were visualized via audio-visual plots, highlighting conversation topics based on occurrence and interpretability. UMEED enhances cognitive and intuitive skills, elevating average topics from 6.98 to 13.56 in a 5- minute conversation with a 143.12 coherence score. LSA achieved 98.39% accuracy, topic modeling 100%. Significantly, real-time grammatical correction integration in the game was realized.",

Therefore, every day, new research contributions are posted, for instance, to the arXiv repository. Hence, it is rather difficult to capture the current ‚Äústate of the field‚Äù and thus, to enter it. This brought the id-art NLP techniques to analyse the NLP-focused literature. As a result, (1) meta-level knowledge, concerning the current state of NLP has been captured, and (2) a guide to use of basic NLP tools is provided. It should be noted that all the tools and the dataset described in this contribution are publicly available. Furthermore, the originality of this review lies in its full automation. This allows easy reproducibility and continuation and updating of this research in the future as new researches emerge in the field of NLP.",

        "abstract": " Objective: We developed a modified pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) sequence for measuring cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnia in humans; however, the method has yet to be validated against an established pCASL sequence for assessing brain perfusion at rest. The purpose of this project was to compare resting brain perfusion from our modified sequence (Rest-CVR) to the pCASL sequence developed by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The secondary purpose was to determine the association of these pCASL sequences with lipid biomarkers. Methods: Resting brain perfusion was assessed using both sequences in 7 middle-aged adult participants (56 ¬± 5 years old) using a 64-channel head coil inside a Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanner. The modified Rest-CVR sequence included a shorter scan time (~3 minutes) with a single post-labeling delay and duration of 1800ms, FOV= 215mm2, slice thickness 2.27mm, TR=4510ms, and TE=20ms. Blood samples were also collected to determine the association of each sequence with circulating lipid biomarkers to test the sensitivity of each sequence to clinically relevant risk factors of cerebrovascular disease. Results: Outcomes from the two pCASL sequences were significantly correlated [R2 = 0.88; F (1,5) = 35.06 p = 0.002]. However, resting brain perfusion from Rest-CVR was significantly lower than HCP [Rest-CVR: 58.84 ¬± 15.22 vs. HCP: 81.12 ¬± 12.54 ml/min/100g; p = 0.0008]. Resting brain perfusion measurements from both sequences were negatively associated with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (HCP: r = -0.97; p = 0.0001 and Rest-CVR: r = -0.87; p = 0.008) suggesting sensitivity of both to a clinically relevant risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. However, neither sequence was associated with total cholesterol, triglycerides, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p>0.05 for all). Conclusion: Rest-CVR was determined to be a reliable measure of resting brain perfusion in that it correlated with the HCP protocol; however, the lower magnitude relative to HCP makes it a less valid approach for accurately determining brain perfusion. Resting brain perfusion from both sequences was negatively associated with LDL suggesting both are sensitive to clinically relevant outcomes. The shorter Rest-CVR sequence may be most suitable for studies in which an exact estimate of brain perfusion is not required such as when assessing a relative change to hypercapnia.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nAbstract review is a time and labor-consuming step in the systematic and scoping literature review in medicine. Text mining methods, typically natural language processing (NLP), may efficiently replace manual abstract screening. This study applies NLP to a deliberately selected literature review problem, the trend of using NLP in medical research, to demonstrate the performance of this automated abstract review model.\n\nMethods\nScanning PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, we identified 22,294 with a final selection of 12,817 English abstracts published between 2000 and 2021. We invented a manual classification of medical fields, three variables, i.e., the context of use (COU), text source (TS), and primary research field (PRF). A training dataset was developed after reviewing 485 abstracts. We used a language model called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to classify the abstracts. To evaluate the performance of the trained models, we report a micro f1-score and accuracy.\n\nResults\n The trained models‚Äô micro f1-score for¬†classifying abstracts, into three variables were 77.35% for COU, 76.24% for TS, and 85.64% for PRF.\nThe average annual growth rate (AAGR) of the publications was 20.99% between 2000 and 2020 (72.01 articles (95% CI: 56.80‚Äì78.30) yearly increase), with 81.76% of the abstracts published between 2010 and 2020. Studies on neoplasms constituted 27.66% of the entire corpus with an AAGR of 42.41%, followed by studies on mental conditions (AAGR‚Äâ=‚Äâ39.28%). While electronic health or medical records comprised the highest proportion of text sources (57.12%), omics databases had the highest growth among all text sources with an AAGR of 65.08%. The most common NLP application was clinical decision support (25.45%).\n\nConclusions\nBioBERT showed an acceptable performance in the abstract review. If future research shows the high performance of this language model, it can reliably replace manual abstract reviews.\n",

        "abstract": "Medical image analysis is a vital component of modern medical practice, and the accuracy of such analysis is critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used to visualize the kidneys and identify abnormalities such as cysts, tumors, and stones. Manual interpretation of CT images can be time-consuming and subject to human error, leading to inaccurate diagnosis and treatment. Deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in improving the accuracy and speed of medical image analysis. In this study, we present a CNN-based model to accurately classify CT images of the kidney into four categories: Normal, Cyst, Tumor, and Stone, using the CT KIDNEY DATASET. The proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of 99.84% on the test set, with a precision of 0.9964, a recall of 0.9986, and a F1-score of 0.9975 for all categories. The model was able to accurately classify all images in the test set, indicating its high accuracy in identifying abnormalities in CT images of the kidney. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of deep learning models based on CNNs in accurately classifying CT images of the kidney, which could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment outcomes for patients. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the use of deep learning models in medical image analysis, highlighting the potential of these models in improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Arabic named entity recognition (NER) is a challenging problem, especially in conversational data such as social media posts. To address this problem, we propose an Arabic weak learner NER model called ANER-HMM, which leverages low quality predictions that provide partial recognition of entities. By combining these predictions, we achieve state of the art NER accuracy for cases for out-of-domain predictions. ANER-HMM leverages a hidden markov model to combine multiple predictions from weak learners and gazetteers. We demonstrate that ANER-HMM outperforms the state-of-the-art Arabic NER methods without requiring any labeled data or training deep learning models which often require large computing resources.",

Learning AI models is substantially different from the classical software development process. Whereas in classical software development, developers explicitly describe the operation and behavior to the computer, in AI model learning, the models themselves learn from the input data. This paper presents a possible solution that applies the agile Scrum methodology used in classical software development to the development of dictionary-based NLP models, and identify the agile development opportunities in case of the machine learning-based NLP models.",

        "abstract": "Many data science problems require processing log data derived from web pages, apis or other internet traffic sources. URLs are one of the few ubiquitous data fields that describe internet activity, hence they require effective processing for a wide variety of machine learning applications. While URLs are structurally rich, the structure can be both domain specific and subject to change over time, making feature engineering for URLs an ongoing challenge.  In this research we outline the key structural components of URLs and discuss the information available within each. We describe methods for generating features on these URL components and share an open source implementation of these ideas. In addition, we describe a method for exploring URL feature importance that allows for comparison and analysis of the information available inside URLs. We experiment with a collection of URL classification datasets and demonstrate the utility of these tools. Package and source code is open on https://pypi.org/project/url2features.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nComputational typology has gained traction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years, as evidenced by the increasing number of papers on the topic and the establishment of a Special Interest Group on the topic (SIGTYP), including the organization of successful workshops and shared tasks. A considerable amount of work in this sub-field is concerned with prediction of typological features, for example, for databases such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) or Grambank. Prediction is argued to be useful either because (1) it allows for obtaining feature values for relatively undocumented languages, alleviating the sparseness in WALS, in turn argued to be useful for both NLP and linguistics; and (2) it allows us to probe models to see whether or not these typological features are encapsulated in, for example, language representations. In this article, we present a critical stance concerning prediction of typological features, investigating to what extent this line of research is aligned with purported needs‚Äîboth from the perspective of NLP practitioners, and perhaps more importantly, from the perspective of linguists specialized in typology and language documentation. We provide evidence that this line of research in its current state suffers from a lack of interdisciplinary alignment. Based on an extensive survey of the linguistic typology community, we present concrete recommendations for future research in order to improve this alignment between linguists and NLP researchers, beyond the scope of typological feature prediction.",

        "abstract": "Techniques that employ natural language processing (NLP), often known as text summarizing, automatically construct summaries of extensive texts. Extractive and abstractive summarization are two main categories that may be used to classify these methods. In extractive summarizing, the most significant lines or phrases from a text are isolated and used to generate a summary. On the other hand, in abstractive summarization, a summary is generated that is clear, short, and accurate in its representation of the text's primary concepts. NLP methods like sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and semantic analysis are used in generating a summary from a text and locating and extracting relevant information from the text. Text summarizing is a subject that has received a significant amount of study and has applications in various fields, including the summation of news articles, documents, and emails, among other things.",

        "abstract": "Several studies discuss airplane failure prediction due to bird strikes. However, these studies need to analyze further the imbalance in their dataset. Our research aim is to create an airplane failure prediction by bird strike using a machine learning method optimized using GA feature selection. GA feature selection uses AUC maximization as the objective function to tackle imbalance problems in the bird strike dataset. First, we obtained the airplane bird strike dataset from Kaggle. We carry out preprocessing on the dataset.We then compared and chose one of four stateof-the-art machine learning methods: SVM, MLP, logistic regression, and random forest. The selection process involves oversampling methods, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), and optimum threshold selection, which involves geometric mean (g- mean) and area under curve (AUC) values. Finally, we optimize airplane failure prediction by performing AUC maximization using GA feature selection. Our test results show that random forest is the best machinelearning method in airplane failure prediction compared to SVM, logistic regression, and MLP. SMOTE can increase random forest AUC from 0.845 to 0.878. Finally, the random forest model from ImbGAFS is better than the conventional method without feature selection. The increase in the AUC value is from 0.878 to 0.889. Then, after carrying out optimal threshold selection, ImbGAFS+random forest also has better sensitivity, specificity, and g-mean than conventional methods. The increase is from 0.7737, 0.8350, and 0.8037 to 0.8033, 0.8301, and 0.8166, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The number of patients diagnosed with depression yearly is a growing concern among mental health advocates. Consequently, the ef ect of this ailment is detrimental to not only the patient but also family members, as well as their jobs or school. Many factors, ranging from hereditary conditions to life-altering experiences, can trigger depression, and symptoms vary between individuals. Hence, the disparity of symptoms in diagnosing depression makes it dif icult to identify early on. Fortunately, the prevalence of social media platforms has led to individuals posting updates on various aspects of their lives, particularly their mental health. These platforms now provide valuable data sources for mental health researchers, aiding in the timely diagnosis of depression. In this research, we use sentiment analysis to identify depressed tweets from random tweets. We used six natural language processing frameworks for our classification. They are BERT, XLNet, ALBERT, DeBERTa, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA. Our results show that BERT performs best with an accuracy of 99%, while ALBERT is the model with the lowest accuracy rate at 87%. This research shows that by leveraging NLP frameworks, we can successfully utilize machine learning for the early detection of depression and help diagnose individuals struggling with this ailment.",

We evaluate the extent to which the high attention contexts for a given brand‚Äôs ads remain consistent for that brand, and the extent to which those contexts remain consistent across many brands within an industry vertical.  The results illustrate that consumer attention on advertising can vary significantly across creatives for a specific brand, and across a vertical.

        "abstract": "Chomsky (2001) has proposed a phase-based compu- tation, which takes a hybrid approach adopting derivational, but slightly representational, structure building. What is important in this proposal is that T is never finite in itself, but can bear a full œÜ-feature set only when it is selected by the phase head C. Chomsky (2008) in turn has assumed further that T can agree and attract its goal, the subject only after it inherits relevant features from C. This means that T is only partially projected without Spec when C is introduced into the derivation. This non-cyclic structure building is possible within a phase, hence slight representational flavor. However, Chosmky (2013, 2015) discarded this phase-based partially representational approach, to the effect that TP should complete its projection, which is now reinterpreted as an exocentric structure consisting of two maximal projections (with no specifiers). In this paper, we will explore the reason why Chomsky recently rejected the non-cyclic structure building within a phase. And we will note problems with this approach, and try to seek a solution in the recent MERGE system proposed by Chomsky (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, Forthcoming).",

This paper attempts to address this society-wide problem thoroughly and universally through a technical approach of detecting, analyzing, and blocking the websites intelligently. Our design highlights the applications of machine learning and natural language processing, and is implemented purely in Python, Javascript, and several other web development languages. After retrieving the web content from the target websites through the web scraping process, summarizing the data to a number of short paragraphs via the use of NLP, we were able to perform data analysis on the result and finally block the websites accordingly [4].

Statistical approach is an alternative which can be used to bypass lack of rule-based implementations. The paper presents a model for classification of unstructured text in Serbian language. The model uses n-gram-based stemming to create document attributes vectors. Vectors are created on 3-, 4- and 5-grams. Vector reduction is tested on two criteria: n-gram entropy and number of occurrences, and two lengths: 1000 and 2000 n-grams. The support vector machine is used to classify documents. The model is trained and tested on a dataset collected from a Serbian news portal. Classification accuracy of over 80% is achieved. The presented model provides a good basis for range of applications in business decision automation for low-resource languages.",

Challenges in achieving this goal arise from the rarity of the trends to be located, as well as from the combinatorics involved in locating in data cubes nodes with unusual trends. We show that exhaustive solutions are worst-case intractable, and introduce tractable heuristic algorithms that enable effective and efficient data-cube navigation in a particular manner that we call trend surfing. We report the results of testing the proposed algorithms on three real-life data sets; these results showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms against the exhaustive baseline.",

To validate the model selection algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively, the approach was tested on publicly available labelled datasets. For all the experiments, data was pre-processed employing an effective NLP pre-processing procedure along with an Alt-tech customised list of stop-words. Using the validated topic model selection algorithm, LDA topics with Ngram range = (4, 4) were extracted from the targeted Alt-tech dataset. The findings from topic models were qualitatively evaluated by a social scientist and are further discussed. The conclusion of the work suggests that the proposed model selection procedure is effective for corresponding corpus length and context. Future work avenues are suggested to improve the outcome of Alt-tech topic modeling.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA widely used approach for protein conjugation is through the lysine residues reacting with NHS- or other active esters. However, it is a challenge to precisely control the degree of labeling (DoL) due to the instability of active ester and variability of reaction efficiencies. Here, we provide a protocol for better control of aDoL using existing Copper-free Click Chemistry reagents. It is a two-step reaction with one purification in between. Briefly, proteins of interest were first activated with azide-NHS. After removing unreacted azide-NHS, the protein-N3 is then reacted with a limited amount of complementary click tag. Our studies have shown the click tag will fully react with the protein-N3 after 24¬†h‚Äô incubation, and therefore does not require additional purification steps. As such, the aDoL is equal to the input molar ratio of the click tag and the protein. Furthermore, this approach offers a much simpler and more economical way to perform parallel microscale labeling. Once a protein is pre-activated with N3-NHS, any fluorophore or molecule with the complementary click tag can be attached to the protein by mixing the two ingredients. Quantities of the protein used in the click reaction can be at any desired amount. In one example, we labeled an antibody in parallel with 9 different fluorophores using a total of 0.5¬†mg of antibody. In another example, we labeled Ab with targeted aDoL value from 2 to 8. In a stability comparison study, we have found the conjugated fluorophore using the suggested click protocol stayed attached to the protein longer than with standard NHS-fluorophore labeling.",

In this research paper, we compare various dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis(PCA), Independent Component Analysis(ICA), Local Linear Embedding(LLE), Local Binary Patterns(LBP), and Simple Autoencoder, on the Olivetti dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of face recognition. We evaluate the performance of these dimensionality reduction techniques using various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal of this research is to determine which combination of dimensionality reduction technique and classification algorithm is the most effective for the Olivetti dataset. Our research provides insights into the performance of various dimensionality reduction techniques and classification algorithms on the Olivetti dataset.

        "abstract": "United Nations have declared the current decade (2021-2030) as the ‚ÄùUN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration‚Äù to join R&D forces to fight against the ongoing environmental crisis. Given the ongoing degradation of earth ecosystems and the related crucial services that they offer to the human society, ecosystem restoration has become a major society-critical issue. It is required to develop rigorously software applications managing ecosystem restoration. Reliable models of ecosystems and restoration goals are necessary. This paper proposes a rigorous approach for ecosystem requirements modeling using formal methods from a model-driven software engineering point of view. The authors describe the main concepts at stake with a metamodel in UML and introduce a formalization of this metamodel in Alloy. The formal model is executed with Alloy Analyzer, and safety and liveness properties are checked against it. This approach helps ensuring that ecosystem specifications are reliable and that the specified ecosystem meetsthe desired restoration goals, seen in our approach as liveness and safety properties. The concepts and activities of the approach are illustrated with CRESTO, a real-world running example of a restored Costa Rican ecosystem",

        "abstract": "Across various domains, data from different sources such as Baidu Baike and Wikipedia often manifest in distinct forms. Current entity matching methodologies predominantly focus on homogeneous data, characterized by attributes that share the same structure and concise attribute values. However, this orientation poses challenges in handling data with diverse formats. Moreover, prevailing approaches aggregate the similarity of attribute values between corresponding attributes to ascertain entity similar- ity. Yet, they often overlook the intricate interrelationships between attributes, where one attribute may have multiple associations. The simplistic approach of pairwise attribute comparison fails to harness the wealth of information encapsulated within entities.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel en- tity matching model, dubbed ‚ÄùEntity Matching Model for Capturing Complex Attribute Relationships (EMMCCAR),‚Äù built upon pre-trained models. Specifically, this model transforms the matching task into a sequence matching problem to mitigate the impact of varying data formats. Moreover, by introducing attention mechanisms, it identifies complex relationships between attributes, emphasizing the degree of matching among multiple attributes rather than one-to-one correspondences. Through the integration of the EMM-CCAR model, we adeptly surmount the challenges posed by data heterogeneity and intricate attribute interdependencies. In comparison with the prevalent DER-SSM and Ditto approaches, our model achieves improvements of approximately 4% and 1% in F1 scores, respectively. This furnishes a robust solution for addressing the intricacies of attribute complexity in entity matching.",

        "abstract": "Creating food systems that provide healthy food for everyone without exploiting human or planetary resources, is one of the greatest challenges of this century. Front-end nutrition labeling and eco-efficiency systems have been proposed as a means of addressing health disparities and sustainable food and nutrition security. The aim of the study is the exploratory analysis of existing front-end nutrition labeling and eco-efficiency systems in order to make informed decisions about the further development of an effective labeling system. To carry out the study, the method of systematic document review and data triangulation was applied. The review provided information on the impact of color-coded labels and warnings in driving consumer purchasing behavior towards healthier products. Each labeling system had different attributes that should be taken into account when developing front-end nutrition labeling and eco-efficiency policies, depending on local contexts. However, front-end labeling is unlikely to be a panacea for changing consumer behavior but can target small incremental changes at different levels and actors in the food system.",

Mit diesem Artikel wird ein Beitrag zum Diskurs geleistet, indem vertieft der Bereich der Sprachverarbeitung durch KI, das Natural Language Processing (NLP), in den Blick genommen wird. Verarbeitung nat√ºrlicher Sprache ist aufgrund der hohen Bedeutung kommunikativer Prozesse f√ºr die Praxis der Sozialen Arbeit von besonderer Relevanz, zugleich wird die Profession der Sozialen Arbeit tangiert. Bezugnehmend auf Staub-Bernasconis Handlungstheorie werden Implikationen und Diskussionspunkte von NLP identifiziert und diskutiert. Zudem werden m√∂gliche Gratifikationen f√ºr Klient*innen herausgearbeitet, die sich u.‚ÄØa. aus der Wirkung und sozialen Interaktion ergeben. Hier wird die Media-Equation-Theorie von Nass und Reeves als Erkenntnisfolie herangezogen. Vor diesen Perspektiven ergeben sich sowohl Risiken (u.‚ÄØa. die Gefahr einer modularisierten Herausl√∂sung genuin sozialarbeiterischer T√§tigkeit) als auch Chancen (u.‚ÄØa. Teilhabe, niederschwelliger Zugang, Zugriff auf breitere Datenbasis).",

        "abstract": "NLP models have demonstrated susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thereby compromising their robustness. Even slight modifications to input text possess the capacity to deceive NLP models, leading to inaccurate text classifications. In the present investigation, we introduce Lexi-Guard: an innovative method for Adversarial Text Generation. This approach facilitates the rapid and efficient generation of adversarial texts when supplied with initial input text. To illustrate, when targeting a sentiment classification model, the utilization of product categories as attributes is employed, ensuring that the sentiment of reviews remains unaltered. Empirical assessments were conducted on real-world NLP datasets to showcase the efficacy of our technique in producing adversarial texts that are both more semantically meaningful and exhibit greater diversity, surpassing the capabilities of numerous existing adversarial text generation methodologies. Furthermore, we leverage the generated adversarial instances to enhance models through adversarial training, demonstrating the heightened resilience of our generated attacks against model retraining endeavors and diverse model architectures.",

In this squib, we describe the types of flaws we discovered, which include coding errors (e.g., loading the wrong system outputs to evaluate), failure to follow standard scientific practice (e.g., ad hoc exclusion of participants and responses), and mistakes in reported numerical results (e.g., reported numbers not matching experimental data). If these problems are widespread, it would have worrying implications for the rigor of NLP evaluation experiments as currently conducted. We discuss what researchers can do to reduce the occurrence of such flaws, including pre-registration, better code development practices, increased testing and piloting, and post-publication addressing of errors.",

Being an exclusive Afrikaner town, this town is highly controversial and is often seen as a remnant of apartheid, leading residents of this town to form the perception that the media treats them unfairly. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, namely a lexicon-based sentiment analysis classification and a machine-learning political bias classification, it is shown that the vast majority of news reports and opinion pieces on this town exhibit minimal political bias, and publications on this town are evenly distributed between left and right political bias. In addition, while the majority of news reports and opinion pieces published on this town are neutral, more publications are positive than negative. However, differences in the depiction of this town based on the language of publications are also discussed, with English publications more negative and Afrikaans publications more positive, and the majority of publications on this town are in Afrikaans. Overall, the study finds that while some individual publications present Orania in a very negative light, in general, the media reports on this town in a balanced way.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nEnd-to-end neural Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are notoriously difficult to understand. This has given rise to numerous efforts towards model explainability in recent years. One desideratum of model explanation is faithfulness, that is an explanation should accurately represent the reasoning process behind the model‚Äôs prediction. In this survey, we review over 110 model explanation methods in NLP through the lens of faithfulness. We first discuss the definition and evaluation of faithfulness, as well as its significance for explainability. We then introduce recent advances in faithful explanation, grouping existing approaches into five categories: similarity-based methods, analysis of model-internal structures, backpropagation-based methods, counterfactual intervention, and self-explanatory models. For each category, we synthesize its representative studies, strengths, and weaknesses. Finally, we summarize their common virtues and remaining challenges, and reflect on future work directions towards faithful explainability in NLP.",

        "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems have a mundane impact, yet they harbour either obvious or potential gender bias. The automation of decision-making in NLP models even exacerbates unfair treatment. In recent years, researchers have started to notice this issue and have made some approaches to detect and mitigate these biases, yet no consensus on the approaches exists. This paper discusses the interdisciplinary field of linguistics and computer sciences by presenting the most common gender bias categories and breaking them down with ethical and artificial intelligence approaches. Specific methods for detecting and minimizing bias are shown around biases present in raw data, annotator, model, and the linguistic gender system. In this paper, an overview of the hotspots and future perspectives of this research topic is presented. Limitations of some detection methods are pinpointed, providing novel insights into future research. ",

On this basis, this study takes NLP as an example to provide a basic introduction to the development history and application of NLP, and lists some models in the development process. These are valuable knowledge that is still used in OpenAI applications. Before in-depth study of the components and models of ChatGPT, this paper also mentioned the basic introduction of chat robots. Accorind to the analysis, it is shown that people are increasingly interested in the use of ChatGPT in various applications, including language translation and question answering. However, it also lists several limitations of ChatGPT, e.g., its tendency to generate biased or inappropriate responses. The future prospects of ChatGPT or similar products are also mentioned later.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Recommender systems is one of the most successful machine learning applications. We are exposed to the products/information recommended by these systems everywhere in our daily life. This project will introduce several recommender systems in NLP, specifically in the domain of online recruitment. I will explain the important ideas behind the recommender systems in our web application, it might be also similar with those in recruiting platforms like LinkedIn, Xing. One of my main jobs is to design and develop recommender systems on the skill-based matching app. Before getting into this specific topic, I would like to go over the general concepts and methods of current recommender system in different domains. We have provided a brief overview of the approaches, techniques, and applications of recommendation systems in this paper. One significant application of recommendation systems is in the field of job recruitment, where candidates are chosen using online job recruitment portals based on their profiles, employment histories, and behavioral tendencies. According to a recent survey, this field has not been thoroughly investigated up to this point, and the current job recommender system has many flaws. They analyze resumes, profiles, and job descriptions, but because of the \"cold start\" problem, new job postings and candidate profiles are not properlymatched. In some cases, potential candidates lose their jobs as a result of inadequate job descriptions and education information in the ontology.",

        "abstract": "The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence faces challenges due to the absence of a widely accepted taxonomy that facilitates the quantitative evaluation of explainability in Machine Learning algorithms.  In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy that addresses the current gap in the literature by providing a clear and unambiguous understanding of the key concepts and relationships in XAI. Our approach is rooted in a systematic analysis of existing definitions and frameworks, with a focus on transparency, interpretability, completeness, complexity and understandability as essential dimensions of explainability. This comprehensive taxonomy aims to establish a shared vocabulary for future research.  To demonstrate the utility of our proposed taxonomy, we examine a case study of a Recommender System designed to curate and recommend the most suitable online resources from MERLOT. By employing the SHAP package, we quantify and enhance the explainability of the RS within the context of our newly developed taxonomy.",

        "abstract": "Exams for universities and boards are administered offline each year. Many students show up for subjective exams. It took a lot of work to manually evaluate such a big number of papers. The evaluation's quality can occasionally fluctuate depending on the evaluator's attitude. The evaluation process takes a lot of time and effort. Objective or multiple choice questions are commonly found in competitive and entrance tests. These tests are reviewed using a machine because that is how they were administered, making evaluation simple. The manual evaluation of subjective papers is a difficult and taxing undertaking. A major obstacle when utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze subjective articles is a lack of understanding and acceptance of the findings. There have been numerous attempts to use computer science to evaluate student responses. To accomplish this objective, the majority of the effort, however, needs standard counts or precise terms. There are also not enough carefully selected data sets. In order to evaluate descriptive responses automatically, this paper proposes a novel approach that makes use of various machine learning, natural language processing, and tools like WorldNet, Word2vec, word mover's distance (WMD), cosine similarity, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Responses are assessed using solution statements and keywords, and a machine learning model is built to forecast the grades of responses. Overall, the results indicate that WMD outperforms cosine similarity. The machine learning model could also be employed independently with appropriate training. Without the MNB model, experimentation produces an accuracy of 88%. Using MNB, the error rate is further decreased by 1.3%. Keywords - Subjective answer evaluation, big data, machine",

Presently, in which large facts is available on the internet, it's far maximum important to offer the improved approaches to extract the statistics quickly and most successfully. It may be very hard for human beings to manually extract the precis of a large document of text. There are lots of text substances to be had on the internet. So, there's a hassle of looking for related files from the quantity of documents to be had and absorbing associated statistics from it. In essence to determine out the previous issues, the automated textual content summarization could be very a whole lot essential.
