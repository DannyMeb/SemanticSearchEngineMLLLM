        "abstract": "Transfer pricing is one on the greatest problem of the global system of taxation and therefore the efficient TP tax control is of special importance. As the risk-oriented approach allows to improve the TP tax control, tax administrations as well as businesses should apply and develop it for the timely risks identification. This assumption is based on the review of foreign and domestic scientific literature provided in this article. This study aims to analyze the significance of TP risk management system and its impact on the TP tax control and voluntary tax compliance as well as to develop proposals on the TP risks assessment methods, focusing on Ukrainian tax regulation as well as the OECD and the EU tax framework. The research methods include systematic and comparative analysis of scientific literature, deduction, induction, analysis, synthesis and systems approach. To fulfill the objective of this study the analyses of legislative regulation of the TP control at both the international and the country level is provided, focusing on the stage of the monitoring of the controlled transactions. For the enhancement monitoring stage of the TP control the algorithm for the risk identification and assessment for the monitoring of controlled transaction (CT) is suggested. The study also provides for the methodology on comparison of the profitability of taxpayers with the average in the industry and methodology for building the TP risks matrix. The study results revealed the significance of the TP risks management processes standardization that allows its automatization and could contribute to the TP tax control strengthening as well as an TP compliance improvement. The prospects for future research could be focused on development of an algorithm for comparing the prices of CT with the quoted prices for raw materials.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Globally, over 2.8 million people have MS, and 300 people receive a diagnosis of MS every day. It is 3 times more common in females than males. Autoimmunity, environmental factors, Epstein-Barr virus, and genetics are implicated in the etiology of MS. The pathophysiology of MS is limited to the central nervous system, resulting in focal inflammation of the blood-brain barrier and neurodegeneration of the axons, neurons, and synapse. Diagnosis is made based on clinical history, physical examination, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. Early diagnosis is key to controlling the progression of the disease using disease-modifying therapies.\n\n\nMethods\nWe trained machine learning models with over 3000 sets of patient data with and without MS. The data was sourced from MIMIC-IV, a hospital-wide electronic health record (EHR) from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. A random forest model with 300 trees with a maximal depth of 30 layers and gain ratio was used as the criterion for selecting the attributes for splitting. The model was tested with 10-fold cross-validation. This model produced optimal performance. The input parameters consisted of age, gender, and the results of routine blood markers, such as complete blood counts, differential counts, comprehensive metabolic panels, and lipid panels recorded up to 3 years before the diagnosis of MS was identified. An evaluation of the performance was conducted using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\n\n\nResults\nWe were able to show that the model could predict the risk for MS, with an AUC of 0.98 and accuracy of 0.92. This gave the model 0.91 sensitivity, 0.92 specificity, 0.92 positive predictive value, and 0.91 negative predictive value. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit seemed predominantly to contribute to the identification of risk for MS. Prediction accuracy was consistent up to 3 years prior to diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusion\nStudies have shown that five types of immune cells (plasma cells, monocytes, macrophage M2, neutrophils, and eosinophils) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were significantly altered in MS cases compared to the control group. Brain shrinkage in patients with MS may be linked to hemoglobin protein in the blood leaked through the blood-brain barrier. Albumin, the most abundant protein in plasma, gains access to CNS tissue, where it is exposed to an inflammatory milieu and tissue damage, e.g., demyelination. Our model identified the pattern of the combined values of these markers, contributing to the prediction. Thus AI/ML-based prediction models may be able to help identify the risk for MS years before neurological symptoms appear. This may help to prompt close monitoring of these patients for periodic neurological and cognitive exams as soon as the first symptoms appear. Early confirmation of the diagnosis with imaging and CSF studies may ensure prompt consideration for disease-modifying therapies.\n",

Adopting a data-driven perspective, risk-assessment methods for cold food chains are summarized based on qualitative risk assessment, quantitative risk assessment, and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. The advantages and disadvantages of each are summarized. Finally, the problems and challenges in current cold food chain risk-assessment research are summarized in three aspects: the data credibility of cold food chain traceability systems, cold-chain food safety audit methods, and nontraditional cold food chain risk assessment. Suggestions are given for strengthening the cold food chain risk-assessment system to provide a decision-making reference to help regulatory authorities take risk prevention and control measures.",

This paper studies an ADA model generality problem where the objective is to address the limitation of current ADA solutions that are often optimized only for a single disaster event and lack the generality to provide accurate performance across different disaster events. To address this limitation, we work with domain experts and local community stakeholders in disaster response to develop CollabGeneral, a subjective logic-driven crowd-AI collaborative learning framework that integrates AI and crowdsourced human intelligence into a principled learning framework to address the ADA model generality problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world ADA datasets demonstrate that CollabGeneral consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by significantly improving the ADA model generality across different disasters.",

        "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence has greatly unleashed AI creativity and is profoundly transforming the thinking process, practical methods, and aesthetic forms of future design innovation. This study provides an in-depth analysis of computers’ innovative thinking, design practice, and aesthetic paradigms driven by artificial intelligence, namely computational thinking in the cognitive field, computational design in the practical field, and computational aesthetics in the aesthetic field. Starting from the concept of computational thinking, the article analyzes six general processes of computational thinking, including decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Secondly, three common types of computational design were compared and analyzed, namely parametric design, generative design, and algorithm design. Among them, algorithm design is a generation process that generates design results through algorithm writing and rule formulation; Parametric design is an interactive process where the components of the design model are interrelated, allowing for real-time updates and modifications throughout the entire design process; Generative design is an iterative process where software generates many creative results and solutions for designers to make decisions and choices. Finally, the study analyzed the aesthetic forms and carriers of computational aesthetics. Among them, aesthetic forms include organic growth, geometric repetition, mathematical rhythm, dynamic order, heterotypic novelty, science fiction grandeur, and fractal deconstruction; Aesthetic carriers include form, structure, texture, pattern, layout, visual dynamic effects, etc. This study is a highly refinement to innovative thinking, design practice, and aesthetic paradigms in the era of artificial intelligence, highlighting important directions for future design development.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) defines four risk categories for AI systems: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal. However, it lacks a clear methodology for the assessment of these risks in concrete situations. Risks are broadly categorized based on the application areas of AI systems and ambiguous risk factors. This paper suggests a methodology for assessing AI risk magnitudes, focusing on the construction of real-world risk scenarios. To this scope, we propose to integrate the AIA with a framework developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and related literature. This approach enables a nuanced analysis of AI risk by exploring the interplay between (a) risk determinants, (b) individual drivers of determinants, and (c) multiple risk types. We further refine the proposed methodology by applying a proportionality test to balance the competing values involved in AI risk assessment. Finally, we present three uses of this approach under the AIA: to implement the Regulation, to assess the significance of risks, and to develop internal risk management systems for AI deployers.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nNearly one-third of patients with diabetes are poorly controlled (hemoglobin A1c≥9%). Identifying at-risk individuals and providing them with effective treatment is an important strategy for preventing poor control.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to assess how clinicians and staff members would use a clinical decision support tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) and identify factors that affect adoption.\n\n\nMethods\nThis was a mixed methods study that combined semistructured interviews and surveys to assess the perceived usefulness and ease of use, intent to use, and factors affecting tool adoption. We recruited clinicians and staff members from practices that manage diabetes. During the interviews, participants reviewed a sample electronic health record alert and were informed that the tool uses AI to identify those at high risk for poor control. Participants discussed how they would use the tool, whether it would contribute to care, and the factors affecting its implementation. In a survey, participants reported their demographics; rank-ordered factors influencing the adoption of the tool; and reported their perception of the tool’s usefulness as well as their intent to use, ease of use, and organizational support for use. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. We used descriptive statistics to report demographics and analyze the findings of the survey.\n\n\nResults\nIn total, 22 individuals participated in the study. Two-thirds (14/22, 63%) of respondents were physicians. Overall, 36% (8/22) of respondents worked in academic health centers, whereas 27% (6/22) of respondents worked in federally qualified health centers. The interviews identified several themes: this tool has the potential to be useful because it provides information that is not currently available and can make care more efficient and effective; clinicians and staff members were concerned about how the tool affects patient-oriented outcomes and clinical workflows; adoption of the tool is dependent on its validation, transparency, actionability, and design and could be increased with changes to the interface and usability; and implementation would require buy-in and need to be tailored to the demands and resources of clinics and communities. Survey findings supported these themes, as 77% (17/22) of participants somewhat, moderately, or strongly agreed that they would use the tool, whereas these figures were 82% (18/22) for usefulness, 82% (18/22) for ease of use, and 68% (15/22) for clinic support. The 2 highest ranked factors affecting adoption were whether the tool improves health and the accuracy of the tool.\n\n\nConclusions\nMost participants found the tool to be easy to use and useful, although they had concerns about alert fatigue, bias, and transparency. These data will be used to enhance the design of an AI tool.\n",

        "abstract": "AbstractData‐driven predictive modeling is increasingly being used in risk assessments. While such modeling may provide improved consequence predictions and probability estimates, it also comes with challenges. One is that the modeling and its output does not measure and represent uncertainty due to lack of knowledge, that is, “epistemic uncertainty.” In this article, we demonstrate this point by conceptually linking the main elements and output of data‐driven predictive models with the main elements of a general risk description, thereby placing data‐driven predictive modeling on a risk science foundation. This allows for an evaluation of such modeling with reference to risk science recommendations for what constitutes a complete risk description. The evaluation leads us to conclude that, as a minimum, to cover all elements of a complete risk description a risk assessment using data‐driven predictive modeling needs to be supported by assessments of the uncertainty and risk related to the assumptions underlying the modeling. In response to this need, we discuss an approach for assessing assumptions in data‐driven predictive modeling.",

        "abstract": "As technology moves forward at a breakneck pace, governments are attempting to adopt technologies in their services that are complex and have unknown ramifications, like artificial intelligence (AI). Academic research and literature regarding change management and digital transformation discusses the necessity to have agreement within an organization on the technology project that the organization is considering adopting. One method of ensuring agreement within the socio-technical system is to conduct the appropriate planning prior to procurement. This also helps to avoid starting a project without having the required technological or human capabilities within the organization. Although the motives of private and public sector organizations are different when initiating projects, the human element of data-driven projects is still key to success. With the use of AI maturity models, feasibility studies and readiness assessment methods during the planning phase, public sector organizations exploring deployment of AI solutions in their public services could be able to avoid major pitfalls of projects that do not succeed.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRisk assessment of drilling tool failure prior to field deployment plays a critical role in well construction. Drilling tool failure can be very expensive, due to rig downtime, missed reservoir targets and pre and post job costs. In recent years, data-driven techniques, such as machine learning (ML) methodologies, have gained popularity in drilling operations, including predicting drilling tool failure. This is due to the abundance of operational drilling data, the advancement of ML algorithm capabilities, and computational infrastructure. However, ML models built upon pure data knowledge have several pitfalls: lack of generalization and explainability, data imbalance, and difficulty in optimization.\nThis paper proposes a data-driven technique assisted by expert knowledge during the model building process, comprised of descriptive and predictive analytic frameworks. The descriptive analytic framework considers multiple drilling parameters, such as temperature, vibrations, bit rotary speed, stick slip, torque, weight, drilling fluid properties, circulating hours, and drilling hours. Additionally, data labeling covers information on the failure, run parameters, and active state of the tool. This step evaluates all plausible contributing factors to the failure, which experts then assess, feeding back into the analysis of the set of stress factors to consider.\nIn the following predictive analytics framework, an ensemble of predictive models estimates the parameter importance supporting the feedback from the experts. Partial dependence analysis and individual conditional expectation evaluates interaction between parameters and estimates the contribution of each parameter to the failure event. This technique helps with model explainability, which adds confidence in the results. Boosting technique generalizes the model, and a developed random under-sampling routine handles the imbalance of the data label (failure and survivor). Finally, the Bayesian optimization technique handles the difficulty found during the optimization process.\nAn application demonstrates the novelty of the method proposed in this paper. The application is to evaluate the deployment failure risk of a hydraulic motor in a Measurement-While-Drilling directional drilling unit, and stator-alternator, in the communication-power module of a drill string. The paper also demonstrates an affirmation of the insights from data-driven technique with the laboratory results during failure investigation. Moreover, it is shown that infusing expert knowledge in the analysis framework can result in an improved model performance for failure risk assessment, which in turn contributes significantly to reducing the failure rate.\nML models built upon pure data knowledge have several pitfalls, including lack of generalization and explainability, data imbalance, and difficulty in optimization. The method described here tackles these pitfalls by incorporating subject-matter-expert (SME) knowledge into analytics, machine learning context. This results in a powerful tool, illustrated here in evaluating the failure risk of a component of a downhole tool.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have become pervasive in numerous facets of modern life, wielding considerable influence in critical decision-making realms such as healthcare, finance, criminal justice, and beyond. Yet, the inherent opacity of many AI models presents significant hurdles concerning trust, accountability, and fairness. To address these challenges, Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a pivotal area of research, striving to augment the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive exploration of the state-of-the-art in XAI methods and their practical applications. We delve into a spectrum of techniques, spanning from model-agnostic approaches to interpretable machine learning models, meticulously scrutinizing their respective strengths, limitations, and real-world implications. The landscape of XAI is rich and varied, with diverse methodologies tailored to address different facets of interpretability. Model-agnostic approaches offer versatility by providing insights into model behavior across various AI architectures. In contrast, interpretable machine learning models prioritize transparency by design, offering inherent understandability at the expense of some predictive performance. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and attention mechanisms delve into the inner workings of neural networks, shedding light on feature importance and decision processes. Additionally, counterfactual explanations open avenues for exploring what-if scenarios, elucidating the causal relationships between input features and model outcomes. In tandem with methodological exploration, this survey scrutinizes the deployment and impact of XAI across multifarious domains. Successful case studies showcase the practical utility of transparent AI in healthcare diagnostics, financial risk assessment, criminal justice systems, and more. By elucidating these use cases, we illuminate the transformative potential of XAI in enhancing decision-making processes while fostering accountability and fairness. Nevertheless, the journey towards fully transparent AI systems is fraught with challenges and opportunities. As we traverse the current landscape of XAI, we identify pressing areas for further research and development. These include refining interpretability metrics, addressing the scalability of XAI techniques to complex models, and navigating the ethical dimensions of transparency in AI decision-making.Through this survey, we endeavor to cultivate a deeper understanding of transparency in AI decision-making, empowering stakeholders to navigate the intricate interplay between accuracy, interpretability, and ethical considerations. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and inspiring collaborative innovation, we aspire to catalyze future advancements in Explainable AI, ultimately paving the way towards more accountable and trustworthy AI systems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractExtreme precipitation events can lead to severe negative consequences for society, the economy, and the environment. It is therefore crucial to understand when such events occur. In the literature, there are a vast number of methods for analyzing their connection to meteorological drivers. However, there has been recent interest in using machine learning methods instead of classic statistical models. While a few studies in climate research have compared the performance of these two approaches, their conclusions are inconsistent. To determine whether an extreme event occurred locally, we trained models using logistic regression and three commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms tailored for discrete outcomes: random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines. We used five explanatory variables (geopotential height at 500 hPa, convective available potential energy, total column water, sea surface temperature, and air surface temperature) from ERA5, and local data from the Danish Meteorological Institute. During the variable selection process, we found that convective available potential energy has the strongest relationship with extreme events. Our results showed that logistic regression performs similarly to more complex machine learning algorithms regarding discrimination as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and other performance metrics specialized for unbalanced datasets. Specifically, the ROC AUC for logistic regression was 0.86, while the best-performing machine learning algorithm achieved a ROC AUC of 0.87. This study emphasizes the value of comparing machine learning and classical regression modeling, especially when employing a limited set of well-established explanatory variables.",

        "abstract": "The peculiarity of oil and gas projects is their long implementation period, during which they are subject to the influence of a large number of different risk factors that complicate project implementation and result in failure to achieve the planned economic indicators set by investors. The effective operation of companies therefore depends on how reliably investors can predict the prospects for project development. The success of the subsequent functioning of the investment project depends to a large extent on the reliability of the assessment of the effectiveness of the investment project, based on the optimally chosen strategy of its development, and, above all, on the anticipation of possible risk factors and tools for their prevention. Therefore, at present, the competitive struggle in the oil and gas production industry is currently shifting to the area of pre-project preparation of investment projects and increasing the reliability (quality) of their economic efficiency assessment at the stage of making a decision to start their implementation.Geological risks become important in the implementation of exploration projects, the first stage in the overall process of developing the Company's assets.  It is necessary to find a balance between the cost of project implementation and the amount of accumulated hydrocarbons for the forecast period, which will ensure maximum profitability of the project. The challenge to optimize the financial outlay on the implementation of geological exploration works by focusing on the most promising and important projects for companies becomes relevant. In this regard, the article considers the methodological approaches proposed by the author to assess the risks of exploration with the aim of improving the efficiency of the planning process and reducing inefficient financial costs.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA growing awareness of bias in artificial intelligence (AI) systems has recently emerged, leading to an increased number of publications discussing ethics in AI. Nevertheless, the specific issue of gender bias remains under-discussed. How can design contribute to preventing the emergence of gender bias in AI-driven systems? To answer this question, we investigated the current state of AI ethical guidelines within the European Union. The results revealed that most guidelines do not acknowledge gender bias but address discrimination. This raised our concerns, as addressing multiple biases simultaneously might not effectively mitigate any of them due to their often-unconscious nature. Furthermore, our results revealed a lack of quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of bias prevention implementation methods and solutions. In conclusion, based on our analysis, we propose four recommendations for designing effective guidelines to tackle gender biases in AI. Moreover, we stress the central role of diversity in embedding the gender perspective from the beginning in any design activity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nGiven that AI-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS) are intended to assist in medical decision making, it is essential that clinicians are willing to incorporate AI-DSS into their practice. This study takes as a case study the use of AI-driven cardiotography (CTG), a type of AI-DSS, in the context of intrapartum care. Focusing on the perspectives of obstetricians and midwives regarding the ethical and trust-related issues of incorporating AI-driven tools in their practice, this paper explores the conditions that AI-driven CTG must fulfill for clinicians to feel justified in incorporating this assistive technology into their decision-making processes regarding interventions in labor.\n\nMethods\nThis study is based on semi-structured interviews conducted online with eight obstetricians and five midwives based in England. Participants were asked about their current decision-making processes about when to intervene in labor, how AI-driven CTG might enhance or disrupt this process, and what it would take for them to trust this kind of technology. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with thematic analysis. NVivo software was used to organize thematic codes that recurred in interviews to identify the issues that mattered most to participants. Topics and themes that were repeated across interviews were identified to form the basis of the analysis and conclusions of this paper.\n\nResults\nThere were four major themes that emerged from our interviews with obstetricians and midwives regarding the conditions that AI-driven CTG must fulfill: (1) the importance of accurate and efficient risk assessments; (2) the capacity for personalization and individualized medicine; (3) the lack of significance regarding the type of institution that develops technology; and (4) the need for transparency in the development process.\n\nConclusions\nAccuracy, efficiency, personalization abilities, transparency, and clear evidence that it can improve outcomes are conditions that clinicians deem necessary for AI-DSS to meet in order to be considered reliable and therefore worthy of being incorporated into the decision-making process. Importantly, healthcare professionals considered themselves as the epistemic authorities in the clinical context and the bearers of responsibility for delivering appropriate care. Therefore, what mattered to them was being able to evaluate the reliability of AI-DSS on their own terms, and have confidence in implementing them in their practice.\n",

        "abstract": "The relevance of the topic. In today's highly competitive and dynamic business environment, risk management has become a crucial factor for any organization's success. Operational risk, which includes all business processes, is an all-encompassing risk that needs to be addressed by organizations. However, given the current geopolitical situation and low levels of risk culture in Moldovan enterprises, operational risk management is becoming more critical than ever. To address this issue, the authors of a recent study analyzed the possible factors contributing to the emergence of operational risk in Moldovan enterprises, as well as methods for managing it. The study delved into various risk assessment techniques, risk mitigation measures, and risk transfer strategies to identify the most effective approaches to managing operational risk. By exploring the best practices and methods for minimizing operational risk, the study aimed to provide Moldovan enterprises with valuable insights and tools to improve their risk management practices.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a method to minimize the risk of cancellation of planned surgery in hospital orthopedic departments. The paper proposes a method that combines multi-criteria and multi-faceted risk assessment. Two data sources are used: a fuzzy FTOPSIS method, combined with FMEA assessment. The FMEA method presented in this paper uses the technique of prioritizing preferences according to FTOPSIS similarity to the ideal solution and belief structure, in order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional FMEA indicators. Finally, a numerical case study of process optimization for elective surgery in a Polish clinic is presented. The focus was on planned hip replacements. The effectiveness of the method in assessing the main factors influencing cancellation of elective surgery is demonstrated. A high accuracy of the results and wide adaptability of the method to other areas are features of the combination of the abovementioned methods. The problem addressed in this publication is the high rate of cancellation of elective surgery. The selection of relevant criteria, their importance, and the preferences of the patients were studied. The results of the method provide a viable action plan for the proposed research problem. The proposed method is multifaceted and can be part of an information system to support reorganization, restructuring, and modification of an operational process.",

        "abstract": "This article seeks to understand athletes' perceptions and experiences with AI-driven coaching technologies. The objective is to identify the major themes associated with the adoption, perceived benefits, challenges, and impact of these technologies on motivation and performance, alongside suggestions for future enhancements. Eighteen athletes across various sports disciplines participated in semi-structured interviews. The study employed a thematic analysis approach to identify key themes and sub-themes related to athletes' experiences with AI-driven coaching technologies. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was secured from all participants. Five major themes were identified: Adoption and Adaptation, Perceived Benefits, Challenges and Limitations, Impact on Motivation and Performance, and Suggestions for Improvement. Athletes expressed initial skepticism followed by appreciation for the personalized training and efficiency offered by AI technologies. However, concerns regarding technical issues, lack of personal touch, and data privacy were noted. The impact on motivation and performance was predominantly positive, with athletes acknowledging the role of AI in enhancing training outcomes. Suggestions for improvement emphasized the need for more intuitive user interfaces, enhanced data security, and better integration of human coaching elements. Athletes recognize the transformative potential of AI-driven coaching technologies in enhancing training efficiency, personalization, and injury prevention. Nonetheless, the successful adoption of these technologies hinges on addressing technical challenges, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining the human element in coaching. Future developments in AI-driven coaching technologies should consider athletes' feedback to refine and tailor these tools, ensuring they meet the unique needs of individuals and foster a productive coach-athlete relationship. Suggestions for future research include expanding the participant pool across a wider range of sports and incorporating longitudinal studies to explore the evolution of athlete perspectives over time.",

Firstly, the distribution generations (DG) output data are pre-processed to construct a scenario training sample set and extract seven types of DG daily output characteristics indicators. Secondly, a scenario generation model based on a conditional generation adversarial network is proposed to realize the coupling of scenario reduction and scenario generation based on K-means++ through daily output characteristics indicators. Finally, the optimization model based on hybrid positive linear programming is proposed for distributed power supply acceptance capacity evaluation of the distribution network with the objective of maximum DG access capacity and full consideration of voltage deviation, branch current, tidal current return, and other operational constraints. It is validated by IEEE 33-bus simulation. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed method can effectively quantify the DG capacity uncertainty compared with the traditional method, and the proposed method has higher computational accuracy and efficiency than the traditional method.",

        "abstract": "AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual influencers are now frequently used by brands in various categories to engage customers. However, little is known about who the followers of these AI-based virtual influencers are and more importantly, what drives the followers to use AI-based virtual influencers. The results from a survey support the notion that compensatory mechanisms and the need to belong play important roles in affecting usage intentions of AI-based virtual influencers. Specifically, the study finds that usage intentions are mediated and moderated by compensatory mechanisms that arise from the perception of AI-based virtual influencers’ functional benefits and existential threats to human identity. Furthermore, the need for belonging moderates the effects of the following status (following versus non-following) on perceived personalization benefits of AI-based virtual influencers and behavioral intentions to use AI-based virtual influencers. This study provides important implications for academia delving into the social, cultural, and philosophical implications of AI-based virtual influencers for human societies as well as for brands that plan to use AI-based virtual influencers and gain a better understanding of their customers in AI-driven digital marketing.",

Child health is the most important indicator of a child's growth and development. It is vital to adult health, socioeconomic status, and even lifelong achievement, and is the key to social harmony, stability, and prosperity. Subjects and Methods: But there is not much comment and summary on the latest research progress in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to provide support for the health risk assessment of relatively poor children, explore the internal mechanism of relatively poor children's health risk assessment, and study various factors that affect the growth of relatively poor children.Results: Through the experiment, the health gap between relatively poor children and non-relatively poor children was found. Therefore, people should pay attention to the healthy growth of children. Conclusions: Especially empirical research on the impact of relatively poor families on children's health, and research on the impact of parents on children's health in relatively poor environments; favorable health policy recommendations for promoting the health of relatively poor children, and new research directions and suggestions for promoting the health of relatively poor children.",

        "abstract": "AbstractEthical considerations for assessing the collective benefit of an AI’s policy recommendations are different from assessing the ethical consequences from interacting with an individual. The study of population ethics provides a framework for studying collective benefit or harm in abstract terms. Research into happiness has made significant strides in identifying some key drivers of subjective well-being as measured both individually and collectively across societies. This research examines models from population ethics and statistical studies of subjective well-being to create a measure of benefit with which to judge AI recommendations. These models include refining estimations of the interaction between cultural aspects and economic development and incorporating measures of inequality of happiness and satisfaction through a society. When the impacts of a proposed policy are simulated for multiple successive years, risk discounting is used to measure Net Present Happiness, thus solving the conundrum of considering future generations in ethical considerations as posed in population ethics. Lastly, the Risk-Adjusted Gain in Net Present Happiness is proposed as a reasonable approach to ranking AI policy recommendations and as an AI objective function.",

        "abstract": "Coastal African countries, including Gambia, are increasingly vulnerable to a range of natural disasters, notably flooding, which poses significant challenges to sustainable development and safety. This study set out to comprehensively assess the flood risk in Gambia using a data-driven approach, aiming to enhance flood risk management and prevention strategies. Utilizing geospatial data and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, the research involved mapping and categorizing flood risk zones across various regions. The analysis focused on the identification and categorization of flood risk zones, assessment of the vulnerability of key infrastructures, health facilities, road networks, and settlements to flooding. The findings reveal that a total of 2,721 square kilometers of land is at flood risk categorized as either high or very high. This constitutes 26.89 percent of the country’s of terrestrial area. A total of 25 critical health infrastructure were in areas of this high flood risk categorization – ranging from general hospitals to clinics. Up to 24.5% of the nation's road network was found to be in this flood risk zone. Of the country’s five administrative regions, the West Coast Region which is home to most of its urban centers was most at risk of flooding. Here, of the 353 settlements in this region, 172 of them fell under the high to very high-risk flood zone categorization, constituting 48.7% of the settlements at a significant level of flood vulnerability. This study enhances the understanding of flood hazards in Gambia, providing essential perspectives for decision makers, city planners, and emergency response teams.   This research highlights the need for using data-driven methods in identifying and managing environmental risks. It also advocates for the adoption of long-term strategic planning, infrastructure enhancements, and community-based activities to reduce the effects of floods.",

Traditional risk prediction methods cannot comprehensively evaluate the green credit risk of the enterprise based on the degree of green environmental protection and the industry environment in which the enterprise is located, resulting in the inconsistency between the credit financial risk prediction and the actual results, which increases the bank credit risk. In order to strengthen the management level of green credit and reduce the probability of non-performing loans, a scientific risk assessment method was constructed by using a combination of automatic encoding network and bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model to predict the financial risks of green credit, driven by multi-modal data. Through the study of multimodal data, this paper took green credit financial risk as the research object, aggregated the information of various enterprises to improve the bank’s capital utilization rate, and also promoted enterprises to take the initiative to transform into the direction of green environmental protection. Finally, the experiment proved that multimodal data fusion model was more superior than random forest in risk prediction, reducing the bank’s non-performing loan rate by 3.1% and improving the bank’s risk control level.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a significant global health challenge, requiring the improvement of risk assessment methods using advanced data-driven optimization strategies. This study explores the field of ML by comparing the default implementations of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the context of predicting cardiovascular risk. The study examines the potential enhancements achieved by optimizing these models using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a metaheuristic algorithm known for its capacity to improve complex problem-solving. The comparative analysis assesses the predictive accuracy of default RF and SVM models in identifying cardiovascular risk factors. Subsequently, a PSOtechnique is employed to optimize the parameters of both RF and SVM models, with the objective of maximizing their predictive capabilities. Remarkably, the Random Forest model, when enhanced with PSO stands out as the most precise, attaining an impressive accuracy rate of 97.4%. To strengthen the analytical process, the research includes a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. This involves a thorough analysis of the dataset to reveal hidden patterns, correlations, and possible variables that may cause confusion. The knowledge acquired from EDA not only enhances the optimization process but also facilitates a more profound comprehension of the complex interconnections among different cardiovascular risk factors. The study highlights the crucial significance of data pre-processing in guaranteeing the dependability and resilience of the models. The application of thorough techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and normalization significantly improves the quality of input data, thereby enhancing the performance of ML models. The utilization of various methods such as comparative analysis, optimization with PSO, exploratory data analysis, and rigorous data pre-processing highlights the possibility of creating cardiovascular risk assessment tools that are both highly accurate and dependable. The results of this study add to the ongoing discussion on utilizing sophisticated data analysis techniques to enhance patient outcomes and modify healthcare interventions in the field of cardiovascular health.",

        "abstract": "Researchers aim to develop polygenic risk scores as a tool to prevent and more effectively treat serious diseases, disorders and conditions such as breast cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. Recently, machine learning techniques, in particular deep neural networks, have been increasingly developed to create polygenic risk scores using electronic health records as well as genomic and other health data. While the use of artificial intelligence for polygenic risk scores may enable greater accuracy, performance and prediction, it also presents a range of increasingly complex ethical challenges. The ethical and social issues of many polygenic risk score applications in medicine have been widely discussed. However, in the literature and in practice, the ethical implications of their confluence with the use of artificial intelligence have not yet been sufficiently considered. Based on a comprehensive review of the existing literature, we argue that this stands in need of urgent consideration for research and subsequent translation into the clinical setting. Considering the many ethical layers involved, we will first give a brief overview of the development of artificial intelligence-driven polygenic risk scores, associated ethical and social implications, challenges in artificial intelligence ethics, and finally, explore potential complexities of polygenic risk scores driven by artificial intelligence. We point out emerging complexity regarding fairness, challenges in building trust, explaining and understanding artificial intelligence and polygenic risk scores as well as regulatory uncertainties and further challenges. We strongly advocate taking a proactive approach to embedding ethics in research and implementation processes for polygenic risk scores driven by artificial intelligence.",

        "abstract": "This paper delves into the dynamic intersection between traditional assessment processes and AI-powered technology assessment models within the expansive landscape of the big data era. Tracing the origins of large-scale standardized testing, from Francis Galton's pioneering intelligence testing proposals to the subsequent development of norm-referenced testing (NRT) by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, the historical trajectory underscores the evolution towards authentic assessment paradigms such as computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and performance-based assessment (PBA). These shifts reflect a broader aim of equipping educators with tools to measure student learning effectively and foster continuous learning beyond the confines of the classroom. However, despite the proliferation of methods integrating big data and AI technologies in educational settings, a discernible gap persists between technological capabilities and their practical implementation in education, notably in the realm of student assessment and evaluation. This gap highlights challenges in enhancing assessment accuracy and reliability, evaluating non-cognitive skills, and delivering personalized feedback. The introduction of AI-powered technologies like ChatGPT raises ethical considerations regarding fairness, privacy, and bias, necessitating responsible and equitable deployment.This paper addresses fundamental research questions concerning the historical influences on assessment frameworks, the role of AI-powered technology in driving paradigm shifts, and the ethical considerations surrounding its application. Through a comprehensive literature review, it explores the potential of AI technology to enhance assessment accuracy and reliability while advocating for its responsible use. Despite the challenges posed by traditional assessment processes and AI-powered technology assessment models, educators continually strive to improve student learning and readiness for lifelong learning.By celebrating the invaluable contributions of educators, we can shift the narrative surrounding assessment practices towards a more positive and supportive environment, fostering ethical and innovative uses of AI-powered technology. This celebration serves as inspiration for future research and development in assessment, emphasizing the importance of building upon educators’ innovative practices to shape the future of assessment in the big data era.",

It discusses various AI techniques such as machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing, and their application in credit risk assessment. Furthermore, it examines the challenges and opportunities presented by these frameworks, highlighting their potential to revolutionize the banking sector. Revolutionizing Credit Risk Assessment in Banking, The Role of Artificial Intelligence In the dynamic realm of finance, the assessment of credit risk stands as a fundamental pillar for banking institutions. Traditionally, this process has heavily relied on statistical models and historical data. However, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has catalyzed a transformative shift in this domain. This paper elucidates the theoretical underpinnings of AI frameworks employed in credit risk assessment and investigates their profound implications for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of banking operations. The exploration begins by delineating various theoretical frameworks in AI pertinent to credit risk assessment. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing techniques, these frameworks offer innovative approaches to evaluate creditworthiness. Unlike conventional methods, AI-driven models possess the capacity to ingest vast datasets, identify intricate patterns, and adapt dynamically to evolving market dynamics. Such capabilities empower banks to make more informed and timely decisions regarding lending activities. Moreover, this paper delves into the practical application of AI techniques in credit risk assessment. Through case studies and empirical evidence, it elucidates how these advanced methodologies enable banks to mitigate risks while maximizing profitability. By harnessing AI, financial institutions can optimize credit scoring processes, identify potential defaulters with greater accuracy, and customize lending terms based on individual risk profiles. Additionally, AI facilitates real-time monitoring of credit portfolios, allowing proactive risk management and timely interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.",

        "abstract": "\nHigh-accuracy prediction of geological faults, especially small-amplitude tectonic faults, is essential for an efficient and safe underground mining. Having such information about the location of tectonic faults in the rock mass reduces the likelihood of rock collapse and outburst, gas explosion, and water breakthrough during the mining operations. Modeling of the tectonic structure of the rock mass based on the data from the exploratory drilling and ground geophysical observations is of crucial importance to the extraction of mineral raw materials. Typically, in the areas of mineral extraction, tectonic faults in the rock mass are well studied using these data, but the predicted faults are represented by simplified imaginary surfaces that separate different structural parts of the rock mass and are not normally found by mining in such a form.\nThe actual structure of tectonic faults is revealed in the course of mining, but the use of seismic survey is required for further prediction of such faults. The experience of applying these methods is shown in the examples of studies of tectonic faults of coal seams in the Donbass mines during the period from 2008 to 2012.\nTo illustrate the capabilities of underground and surface 2D seismic surveys to accurately predict the location of faults, a site was chosen at the Dneprovskaya mine, which is characterized by the most amount of data collected from exploration drilling and geophysical methods. Also, in contrast to the mining practice when the coal seams areas are discarded based on the results of research due to difficult geological conditions or are not documented by geologists in the process of panel mining, this specific area is distinguished by the completeness of mapping of real faults exposed by mining operations. Predictions of faults obtained by preliminary and CDP seismic surveys are compared with the real faults exposed by mining operations.\nAn example of research at the Krasnolimanskaya mine shown in this paper is among a few isolated cases utilizing 3D CDP seismic survey at mines. The results of the prediction of tectonic faults and the specifics of data processing and interpretation are examined.\nThe research results considered in this paper can be used for further development of seismic survey methods for high-accuracy prediction of geological faults.\n",

        "abstract": "As AI systems’ sophistication and proliferation have increased, awareness of the risks has grown proportionally. The AI industry is increasingly emphasizing the need for transparency, with proposals ranging from standardizing use of technical disclosures, like model cards, to regulatory licensing regimes. Since the AI value chain is complicated, with actors bringing varied expertise, perspectives, and values, it is crucial that consumers of transparency disclosures be able to understand the risks of the AI system in question. In this paper we propose a risk profiling standard which can guide downstream decision-making, including triaging further risk assessment, informing procurement and deployment, and directing regulatory frameworks. The standard is built on our proposed taxonomy of AI risks, which distills the wide variety of risks proposed in the literature into a high-level categorization. We outline the myriad data sources needed to construct informative Risk Profiles and propose a template and methodology for collating risk information into a standard, yet flexible, structure. We apply this methodology to a number of prominent AI systems using publicly available information. To conclude, we discuss design decisions for the profiles and future work.",

Nottingham Grading is the internationally acceptable system to grade breast cancer. Nuclear pleomorphism is one of the breast cancer biomarkers for computing Nottingham grading. Pathologists grade nuclear pleomorphism on breast cancer glass tissue slides using a conventional microscope which is time consuming and has considerable inter-observer variability between pathologists. The paper proposed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning model to grade grade1, grade2, grade3 nuclear pleomorphism on breast cancer whole slide images (WSI). The proposed Yolov5 model is trained and tested on 1,30,000 WSI tiles having around two lakh annotations. The accuracy of the model is mAP 0.89. The proposed model saves the time and reduces the workload of the pathologist and also helps them  to produce accurate results.",

        "abstract": " In this article, we provide an overview of efforts to regulate the various phases of the artificial intelligence (AI) life cycle. In doing so, we examine whether—and, if so, to what extent—highly fragmented legal frameworks are able to provide safeguards capable of preventing the dangers that stem from AI- and algorithm-driven organisational practices. We critically analyse related developments at the European Union (EU) level, namely the General Data Protection Regulation, the draft AI Regulation, and the proposal for a Directive on improving working conditions in platform work. We also consider bills and regulations proposed or adopted in the United States and Canada via a transatlantic comparative approach, underlining analogies and variations between EU and North American attitudes towards the risk assessment and management of AI systems. We aim to answer the following questions: Is the widely adopted risk-based approach fit for purpose? Is it consistent with the actual enforcement of fundamental rights at work, such as privacy, human dignity, equality and collective rights? To answer these questions, in section 2 we unpack the various, often ambiguous, facets of the notion(s) of ‘risk’—that is, the common denominator with the EU and North American legal instruments. Here, we determine that a scalable, decentralised framework is not appropriate for ensuring the enforcement of constitutional labour-related rights. In addition to presenting the key provisions of existing schemes in the EU and North America, in section 3 we disentangle the consistencies and tensions between the frameworks that regulate AI and constrain how it must be handled in specific contexts, such as work environments and platform-orchestrated arrangements. Paradoxically, the frenzied race to regulate AI-driven decision-making could exacerbate the current legal uncertainty and pave the way for regulatory arbitrage. Such a scenario would slow technological innovation and egregiously undermine labour rights. Thus, in section 4 we advocate for the adoption of a dedicated legal instrument at the supranational level to govern technologies that manage people in workplaces. Given the high stakes involved, we conclude by stressing the salience of a multi-stakeholder AI governance framework. ",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The paper considers the improved design of the wheeled vibration-driven robot equipped with an inertial exciter (unbalanced rotor) and enhanced pantograph-type suspension. The primary purpose and objectives of the study are focused on mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and experimental testing of locomotion conditions of the novel robot prototype. The primary scientific novelty of the present research consists in substantiating the possibilities of implementing the enhanced pantograph-type suspension in order to improve the robot’s kinematic characteristics, particularly the average translational speed.Methods: The simplified dynamic diagram of the robot’s oscillatory system is developed, and the mathematical model describing its locomotion conditions is derived using the Euler-Lagrange differential equations. The numerical modeling is carried out in the Mathematica software with the help of the Runge-Kutta methods. Computer simulation of the robot motion is performed in the SolidWorks Motion software using the variable step integration method (Gear’s method). The experimental investigations of the robot prototype operating conditions are conducted at the Vibroengineering Laboratory of Lviv Polytechnic National University using the WitMotion accelerometers and software. The experimental data is processed in the MathCad software.Results and discussion: The obtained results show the time dependencies of the robot body’s basic kinematic parameters (accelerations, velocities, displacements) under different operating conditions, particularly the angular frequencies of the unbalanced rotor. The numerical modeling, computer simulation, and experimental investigations present almost similar results: the smallest horizontal speed of about 1 mm/s is observed at the supplied voltage of 3.47 V when the forced frequency is equal to 500 rpm; the largest locomotion speed is approximately 40 mm/s at the supplied voltage of 10 V and forced frequency of 1,500 rpm. The paper may be interesting for designers and researchers of similar vibration-driven robotic systems based on wheeled chassis, and the results may be used while implementing the experimental and industrial prototypes of vibration-driven robots for various purposes, particularly, for inspecting and cleaning the pipelines. Further investigation on the subject of the paper should be focused on analyzing the relations between the power consumption, average translational speed, and working efficiency of the considerer robot under various operating conditions.",

Assessing the risk level of light pollution (LPRL) is the foundation and the most important step to study the light pollution problem. In this paper, five primary indicators and 13 secondary indicators are selected, and the indicator weights are determined by EMW and AHP. The light pollution risk levels of different regions are calculated by the Topsis method. The output results show that the LPRL is highest in urban areas, followed by suburban and rural areas, and the LPRL in protected land is lowest, and the model results are consistent with the actual situation.

        "abstract": "AbstractThe development of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is accelerating rapidly. Beyond the urge for technological optimization, public perceptions and preferences regarding the application of such technologies remain poorly understood. Risk and benefit perceptions of novel technologies are key drivers for successful implementation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that condition these perceptions. In this study, we draw on the risk perception and human‐AI interaction literature to examine how explicit (i.e., deliberate) and implicit (i.e., automatic) comparative trust associations with AI versus physicians, and knowledge about AI, relate to likelihood perceptions of risks and benefits of AI in healthcare and preferences for the integration of AI in healthcare. We use survey data (N = 378) to specify a path model. Results reveal that the path for implicit comparative trust associations on relative preferences for AI over physicians is only significant through risk, but not through benefit perceptions. This finding is reversed for AI knowledge. Explicit comparative trust associations relate to AI preference through risk and benefit perceptions. These findings indicate that risk perceptions of AI in healthcare might be driven more strongly by affect‐laden factors than benefit perceptions, which in turn might depend more on reflective cognition. Implications of our findings and directions for future research are discussed considering the conceptualization of trust as heuristic and dual‐process theories of judgment and decision‐making. Regarding the design and implementation of AI‐based healthcare technologies, our findings suggest that a holistic integration of public viewpoints is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nPrecision medicine relies on the identification of robust disease and risk factor signatures from omics data. However, current knowledge-driven approaches may overlook novel or unexpected phenomena due to the inherent biases in biological knowledge. In this study, we present a data-driven signature discovery workflow for DNA methylation analysis utilizing network-coherent autoencoders (NCAEs) with biologically relevant latent embeddings. First, we explored the architecture space of autoencoders trained on a large-scale pan-tissue compendium (n = 75 272) of human epigenome-wide association studies. We observed the emergence of co-localized patterns in the deep autoencoder latent space representations that corresponded to biological network modules. We determined the NCAE configuration with the strongest co-localization and centrality signals in the human protein interactome. Leveraging the NCAE embeddings, we then trained interpretable deep neural networks for risk factor (aging, smoking) and disease (systemic lupus erythematosus) prediction and classification tasks. Remarkably, our NCAE embedding-based models outperformed existing predictors, revealing novel DNA methylation signatures enriched in gene sets and pathways associated with the studied condition in each case. Our data-driven biomarker discovery workflow provides a generally applicable pipeline to capture relevant risk factor and disease information. By surpassing the limitations of knowledge-driven methods, our approach enhances the understanding of complex epigenetic processes, facilitating the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nIdentification and referral of at-risk patients from primary care practitioners (PCPs) to eye care professionals remain a challenge. Approximately 1.9 million Americans suffer from vision loss as a result of undiagnosed or untreated ophthalmic conditions. In ophthalmology, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to predict glaucoma progression, recognize diabetic retinopathy (DR), and classify ocular tumors; however, AI has not yet been used to triage primary care patients for ophthalmology referral.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to build and compare machine learning (ML) methods, applicable to electronic health records (EHRs) of PCPs, capable of triaging patients for referral to eye care specialists.\n\n\nMethods\nAccessing the Optum deidentified EHR data set, 743,039 patients with 5 leading vision conditions (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], visually significant cataract, DR, glaucoma, or ocular surface disease [OSD]) were exact-matched on age and gender to 743,039 controls without eye conditions. Between 142 and 182 non-ophthalmic parameters per patient were input into 5 ML methods: generalized linear model, L1-regularized logistic regression, random forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and J48 decision tree. Model performance was compared for each pathology to select the most predictive algorithm. The area under the curve (AUC) was assessed for all algorithms for each outcome.\n\n\nResults\nXGBoost demonstrated the best performance, showing, respectively, a prediction accuracy and an AUC of 78.6% (95% CI 78.3%-78.9%) and 0.878 for visually significant cataract, 77.4% (95% CI 76.7%-78.1%) and 0.858 for exudative AMD, 79.2% (95% CI 78.8%-79.6%) and 0.879 for nonexudative AMD, 72.2% (95% CI 69.9%-74.5%) and 0.803 for OSD requiring medication, 70.8% (95% CI 70.5%-71.1%) and 0.785 for glaucoma, 85.0% (95% CI 84.2%-85.8%) and 0.924 for type 1 nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 82.2% (95% CI 80.4%-84.0%) and 0.911 for type 1 proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), 81.3% (95% CI 81.0%-81.6%) and 0.891 for type 2 NPDR, and 82.1% (95% CI 81.3%-82.9%) and 0.900 for type 2 PDR.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe 5 ML methods deployed were able to successfully identify patients with elevated odds ratios (ORs), thus capable of patient triage, for ocular pathology ranging from 2.4 (95% CI 2.4-2.5) for glaucoma to 5.7 (95% CI 5.0-6.4) for type 1 NPDR, with an average OR of 3.9. The application of these models could enable PCPs to better identify and triage patients at risk for treatable ophthalmic pathology. Early identification of patients with unrecognized sight-threatening conditions may lead to earlier treatment and a reduced economic burden. More importantly, such triage may improve patients’ lives.\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nTumor purity, the proportion of cancerous cells within a tumor mass, is a pivotal factor in oncological research and clinical practice and plays a significant role in the molecular testing workflow, particularly when selecting samples for genomic analysis. Accurate assessment of tumor purity is crucial for understanding tumor behavior, guiding treatment decisions, and predicting patient outcomes. Traditional methods of analyzing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides for tumor purity are predominantly pathologist manual readouts. This process is both time-consuming and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability, leading to inconsistencies in diagnosis and treatment planning. Here, we introduce an automated AI-based product designed to streamline tumor purity analysis. The RevealAI-HE digital assay leverages state-of-the-art AI algorithms to automate the segmentation and classification of nuclei in H&E slides, enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and speed of tumor purity assessment. RevealAI-HE aims to assist pathologists in decision-making, support oncology research, streamline molecular testing workflows, and improve personalized care.\nMethods\nH&E stained solid tumor slides were imaged using 3D-Histech Pannoramic 1000 and 250 scanners. From this dataset, 104 regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected to cover a wide range of H&E stain intensities in 14 different indications. A nuclear segmentation model based on StarDist-H&E was deployed on these ROIs, and a pathology expert manually assigned one of three classifications to each nuclei: tumor, immune, and stroma. The resulting ground-truth dataset of over 26,000 classified nuclei was used for training a classifier model based on a ResNet architecture. For model evaluation, the nuclei dataset was randomly split into training (80%) and testing (20%) the model, and the training data was batched and randomized for each training epoch to ensure robustness and generalizability. The nuclear segmentation, nucleus classifier, and tumor purity statistics models were integrated into an end-to-end digital assay (RevealAI-HE) using Reveal Biosciences’ proprietary digital assay development pipeline. RevealAI-HE is integrated into Reveal Biosciences’ flagship whole slide image management system, ImageDx.\nResults\nThe RevealAI-HE digital assay’s nucleus classification model achieved a high accuracy across all 14 indications. Compared to manual methods, the AI system significantly reduced the time required for tumor purity analysis. Furthermore, the AI model exhibited excellent consistency in its analyses, addressing the issue of variability seen in manual assessments. These results indicate that our AI product, in many aspects, surpasses the current gold standard of tumor purity analysis (pathologist readout), offering a more efficient, accurate, and reproducible approach.\nCitation Format: Nikolaus R.

        "abstract": "Background: The efficacy of remdesivir in reducing disease severity among COVID-19-infected patients has been established, but concerns have emerged regarding the potential side effects of bradycardia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between remdesivir-induced bradycardia and mortality, while also identifying the related risk factors. Materials and methods: The PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Central and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials and prospective or retrospective cohort studies were included (through 14 July 2023). The random-effects model was implemented using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 to examine the outcomes. Results: A total of 12 prospective or retrospective studies involving 7674 patients were analyzed. The primary outcomes revealed a significant association between remdesivir administration and bradycardia development (Odds ratio = 2.556, 95% CI = 2.049–3.188, p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant increase in the mortality rate was observed among patients with bradycardia during remdesivir treatment (Odds ratio = 0.872, 95% CI = 0.483–1.576, p = 0.651). The secondary outcome demonstrated a significant association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and remdesivir-induced bradycardia (OR: 1.251, 95% CI: 1.003–1.561, p = 0.047). Moreover, patients with obesity (OR = 1.347, 95% CI = 1.098–1.652, p = 0.004) were more likely to experience remdesivir-induced bradycardia. Conclusions: Although a higher risk of bradycardia occurred during remdesivir treatment, the occurrence of remdesivir-induced bradycardia did not lead to higher mortality. Our study also identified patients with obesity and CKD as high-risk subgroups for experiencing bradycardia during remdesivir treatment.",

In this discussion, one argument in particular has gained increasing visibility and influence in various forums and positions of power, ranging from public to private sector organisations. It suggests that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intelligence is possible, if not inevitable, and which can—if not controlled—lead to human extinction (Existential Threat Argument, ETA). Using Jürgen Habermas’s theory of communicative action and the validity claims of truth, truthfulness and rightness therein, we inspect the validity of this argument and its following ethical and societal implications. Our analysis shows that the ETA is problematic in terms of scientific validity, truthfulness, as well as normative validity. This risks directing AI development towards a strategic game driven by economic interests of the few rather than ethical AI that is good for all.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper examines the ethical obligations companies have when implementing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We point to the potential cyber security risks companies are exposed to when rushing to adopt generative AI solutions or buying into “AI hype”. While the benefits of implementing generative AI solutions for business have been widely touted, the inherent risks associated have been less well publicised. There are growing concerns that the race to integrate generative AI is not being accompanied by adequate safety measures. The rush to buy into the hype of generative AI and not fall behind the competition is potentially exposing companies to broad and possibly catastrophic cyber-attacks or breaches. In this paper, we outline significant cyber security threats generative AI models pose, including potential ‘backdoors’ in AI models that could compromise user data or the risk of ‘poisoned’ AI models producing false results. In light of these the cyber security concerns, we discuss the moral obligations of implementing generative AI into business by considering the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We identify two examples of ethical concern, overreliance and over-trust in generative AI, both of which can negatively influence business decisions, leaving companies vulnerable to cyber security threats. This paper concludes by recommending a set of checklists for ethical implementation of generative AI in business environment to minimise cyber security risk based on the discussed moral responsibilities and ethical concern.",

        "abstract": "<p>Environmental changes and food habits affect people's health with numerous<br />diseases in today's life. Machine learning is a technique that plays a vital role<br />in predicting diseases from collected data. The health sector has plenty of<br />electronic medical data, which helps this technique to diagnose various<br />diseases quickly and accurately. There has been an improvement in accuracy<br />in medical data analysis as data continues to grow in the medical field. Doctors<br />may have a hard time predicting symptoms accurately. This proposed work<br />utilized Kaggle data to predict and diagnose heart and diabetic diseases. The<br />diseases heart and diabetes are the foremost cause of higher death rates for<br />people. The dataset contains target features for the diagnosis of heart disease.<br />This work finds the target variable for diabetic disease by comparing the<br />patient's blood sugars to normal levels. Blood pressure, body mass index<br />(BMI), and other factors diagnose these diseases and disorders. This work<br />justifies the filter method and principal component analysis for selecting and<br />extracting the feature. The main aim of this work is to highlight the<br />implementation of three ensemble techniques-Adaptive boost, Extreme<br />Gradient boosting, and Gradient boosting-as well as the emphasis placed on<br />the accuracy of the results.</p>",
