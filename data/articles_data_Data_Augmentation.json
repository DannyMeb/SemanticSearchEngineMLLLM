It was a writing system of theTurkish language for several centuries until it was replaced with the modern Turkish script,which is based on the Latin alphabet, in 1928. With the ever increasing digitization campaigns, millions of Ottoman documents are coming to light. But, their contents are not directly accessible, nor they are digitally editable and searchable. OCR and text recognition technologies can bea solution to this problem in the form of auto-mated and semi-automated conversion systems. This study presents a DL-based characterrecognition system for the printed Ottoman script. We first generate a synthetic text image dataset from a text corpus, and then augment it using some image processing methods. We develop a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory recognizer and train it with the original and the augmented datasets. Finally we apply a Transfer Learning procedure for adapting the system to real image data. The proposed system obtains 0.16 CER on a test set containing line images from a historical printed Ottoman book.",

Although their physical characteristics and, to some extent, neural underpinnings are well documented, their function, with the exception of preventing visual fading, remains poorly understood. In this paper, we propose that the visual system might utilize the relatively large number of similar slightly jittered images produced by fixational eye movements to help learn robust and spatially invariant representations as a form of neural data augmentation. Additionally, we form a link between effects such as retinal stabilization and predictive processing theory, and argue that they may be best explained under such a paradigm.",

We propose FreeHi-C, a data-driven Hi-C simulator for simulating and augmenting Hi-C datasets. FreeHi-C employs a non-parametric strategy for estimating interaction distribution of genome fragments from a given sample and simulates Hi-C reads from interacting fragments. Data from FreeHi-C exhibit higher fidelity to the biological Hi-C data compared with other tools in its class. FreeHi-C not only enables benchmarking a wide range of Hi-C analysis methods but also boosts the precision and power of differential chromatin interaction detection methods while preserving false discovery rate control through data augmentation.",

        "abstract": "<p>In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a diffusion model to generate an augmented labeled dataset of synthetic images. The creation of synthetic images becomes indispensable in condition monitoring applications where capturing a diverse range of damages for training a supervised deep-learning model is impracticable or infeasible. To evaluate the potential of this technique, we explore the case of damage classification in synthetic fiber ropes. The approach involves training and fine- tuning a stable diffusion model to create synthetic photorealistic images, representing three distinct types of damages commonly found in fiber ropes. We assessed the efficacy of our method by training and testing the Resnet50 classifier on the synthetic dataset. Our results show that the classifier’s performance remains stable when up to 75% of the images used for training are synthetically generated. This outcome suggests that synthetically generated images produced by a finely-tuned diffusion model possess sufficient quality to serve as a viable addition to real images in data augmentation.</p>",

The database of eye images was collected from cell phone cameras, and with data augmentation techniques were used to increase the number of samples. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated on the original dataset of 146 diseased and 255 healthy images. The results showed that the VGG16 algorithm achieved a classification accuracy of 99.25% before data augmentation, which was significantly higher than the accuracy of existing methods. Furthermore, after the data augmentation again VGG16 model has significant performance metrics that are 99.9% than other algorithms. The proposed algorithm can be used to accurately diagnose various eye diseases, which can potentially improve the quality of care for patients.",

It provides valuable insights that can be of tremendous help to protein’s function research and the detection of potential cell surface/secreted drug targets. The prediction of protein subcellular localization using bioinformatics methods is an inexpensive option to experimentally approaches. Many computational tools have been built during the past two decades, however, producing reliable prediction has always been the challenge. In this study, a Deep learning (DL) technique is proposed to enhance the precision of the analytical engine of one of these tools called PSORTb v3.0. Its conventional SVM machine learning model was replaced by the state-of-the-art DL method (BiLSTM) and a Data augmentation measure (SeqGAN). As a result, the combination of BiLSTM and SeqGAN outperformed SVM by improving its precision from 57.4% to 75%. This method was applied on a dataset containing 8230 protein sequences, which was experimentally derived by Brinkman Lab. The presented model provides promising outcomes for the future research. The source code of the model is available athttps://github.com/mgetech/SubLoc.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most captivating applications of Deep Learning. In this survey, we consider how the Data Augmentation training strategy can aid in its development. We begin with the major motifs of Data Augmentation summarized into strengthening local decision boundaries, brute force training, causality and counterfactual examples, and the distinction between meaning and form. We follow these motifs with a concrete list of augmentation frameworks that have been developed for text data. Deep Learning generally struggles with the measurement of generalization and characterization of overfitting. We highlight studies that cover how augmentations can construct test sets for generalization. NLP is at an early stage in applying Data Augmentation compared to Computer Vision. We highlight the key differences and promising ideas that have yet to be tested in NLP. For the sake of practical implementation, we describe tools that facilitate Data Augmentation such as the use of consistency regularization, controllers, and offline and online augmentation pipelines, to preview a few. Finally, we discuss interesting topics around Data Augmentation in NLP such as task-specific augmentations, the use of prior knowledge in self-supervised learning versus Data Augmentation, intersections with transfer and multi-task learning, and ideas for AI-GAs (AI-Generating Algorithms). We hope this paper inspires further research interest in Text Data Augmentation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe necessity to address a difficult, significant, real-world image-based counting problem that cannot be adequately addressed with existing methodologies is what inspired this research. In order to overcome the difficulties mentioned above, we suggest a fresh method for teaching counting that builds on the earlier methods in several ways. A useful method for improving the performance of the counting model is data augmentation. The use of data augmentation can raise the amount and quality of training datasets, enhance model performance, and prevent the issue of data over-fitting. The phrase \"data augmentation\" refers to a collection of techniques used to increase the quantity and quality of training datasets so that Deep Learning models can be trained from them. Geometric transformations like color-space enhancement, kernel filters, combining pictures, and feature space augmentation are just a few of the image augmentation methods included in this examination. We propose a novel deep framework for counting, based on deep reinforcement learning. A pre-trained model with change detection is used before repeatedly attempting to build a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based data augmentation strategy. After determining the optimum augmentation action for a given dataset, the augmented dataset is utilized to enhance the model. The outcomes of the experiment demonstrate that the automatic augmentation method may be utilized to produce adaptable augmentation strategies for counting models targeted at certain datasets.",

        "abstract": "This work develops a new method for vector data augmentation. The proposed method applies the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and determines the Eigenvectors of a set of training vectors for a Machine Learning (ML) method and uses them to generate the distilled vectors. The training and the PCA distilled vectors have the same dimension. The user chooses the number of vectors to be distilled and augmented to the set of training vectors. A statistical approach determines the lowest number of vectors to be distilled such that when augmented to the original vectors the extended set trains a ML classifier to achieve a required accuracy. Hence, the novelty of this study is, the distillation of vectors with the PCA method and their use to augment the original set of vectors. The advantage that comes from the novelty is that it increases the statistics of ML classifiers. To validate the advantage, we conducted experiments with four public databases and applied four classifiers: Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine with linear and polynomial kernels. For the purpose of augmentation, we conduct several distillations including nested (double distillation). The latter notion means that new vectors were distilled from already distilled vectors. We train the classifiers with three sets of vectors: original vectors; original augmented with vectors distilled by PCA; original augmented with distilled and double distilled, by PCA, vectors. The experimental results are presented in the paper, and they confirm the advantage that the PCA distilled vectors increase the classification statistics of ML methods, if the distilled vectors augment the original training vectors.",

Thus, we propose a new data preprocessing method with Gaussian Noise and Up-Sampling to increase the AUROC score.\nStudy design:\n Case-control study\nSetting:\n  Data were obtained from patients with head and neck cancer who underwent free flap reconstruction at Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan between May 2019 and June 2020.\nMethods\n The collected dataset was initially divided into training and validation sets. Subsequently, a data augmentation technique was employed on the training dataset to generate additional training data, thereby addressing the issue of imbalanced sample sizes between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The rebalanced training data are then utilized to optimize the parameters of diverse machine learning frameworks, including logistic regression(LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble models, and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP).\nResult\n The AUROC values derived from the original data were respectively 0.50 for the SVM and 0.53, RF, and augmented data were significantly improved to 0.72 for SVM and LR, 0.58, and 0.57, RF. When the features “Age,’ ’Preoperative Hb level,’ and” total blood loss’ were removed, the dropped AUROC value was 0.3, indicating their highest importance.\nConclusion\n The data augmentation method adopted in this study resolves the data imbalance problem and improves the efficacy of most machine learning models used to predict free flap failure in head and neck surgery.",

In this article, a novel Bayesian approach is developed for analyzing arbitrarily censored data under the semiparametric proportional hazards (PH) model. The proposed method adopts M-splines and I-splines to model the baseline hazard and cumulative baseline hazard functions in the PH model, respectively. A new two-stage data augmentation involving exponential and multinomial latent variables is proposed, leading to a nice form of augmented likelihood. Based on this likelihood, an easy-to-implement Gibbs sampler is developed. Simulation studies show that the proposed method works well in estimating both regression parameters and survival functions. A numerical comparison of our method with existing Bayesian methods is also provided. Two real data sets on colorectal cancer and childhood mortality are analyzed for illustration.",
