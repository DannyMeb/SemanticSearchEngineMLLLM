        "abstract": "In this paper we describe our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art senti- ment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks. Our sys- tem leverages a large amount of unlabeled data to pre-train word embeddings. We then use a subset of the unlabeled data to fine tune the embeddings using distant su- pervision. The final CNNs and LSTMs are trained on the SemEval-2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are fined tuned again. To boost performances we ensemble several CNNs and LSTMs to- gether. Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks amongst 40 teams.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer feedback, guiding product development, and informing business decisions. This paper introduces term sentiment entropy (TSE), a novel weighting method that leverages the distribution of sentiment labels associated with words to enhance text classification accuracy. TSE complements traditional TF-IDF techniques by capturing the nuances of sentiment variation across different contexts. Experiments across diverse public datasets demonstrate TSE's potential to improve sentiment analysis performance, especially in capturing subtle sentiment shifts and adapting to specific domains. While computational cost and label quality pose challenges, TSE offers a promising avenue for refining sentiment analysis and opening new research frontiers.",

        "abstract": "Online product reviews have become a valuable resource for consumers seeking detailed information and making informed choices. The process of automatically extracting sentiment or opinions from these reviews heavily relies on sentiment analysis, a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This research article focuses on sentiment categorization in online product evaluations, utilizing innovative techniques for mining consumer opinions. The project aims to establish a robust framework for sentiment analysis that accurately classifies emotions expressed in these reviews. The proposed system incorporates advanced deep learning and machine learning methods to enhance data classification and extract fine-grained sentiment information. The study addresses the unique challenges of sentiment analysis in the context of online product evaluations, including polarity changes, sarcasm, and domain-specific sentiment expressions, which often pose significant obstacles to precise sentiment classification. The approach combines feature engineering and deep learning techniques, extracting lexical, syntactic, and semantic features such as part-of-speech tags, n-grams, sentiment lexicons, and word embeddings from the review texts. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are employed as sophisticated neural network architectures to leverage these features, creating robust representations and capturing contextual information. The suggested architecture is extensively evaluated on a large dataset of online product reviews, demonstrating superior performance in sentiment categorization compared to existing approaches. The evaluation encompasses various sentiment classes, measuring metrics like accuracy, recall, and F1-score, and assessing the framework's adaptability to different product domains. The study showcases the effectiveness of advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms in sentiment categorization, advancing the field of sentiment analysis for online product evaluations. Businesses can gain valuable insights into customer sentiment and make well-informed decisions regarding product enhancements and marketing strategies by leveraging the proposed framework",

Since there is so much actual data from people who are posting messages on their situation in real time thoughts on a range of subjects in everyday life, the collection and analysis of these data, which may well be helpful for political decision or public opinion monitoring, is a worthwhile research project. Therefore, in this paper doing to analyze for public text post on Facebook stream in real time through environment Hadoop ecosystem by using apache spark with NLTK python. The post or feeds are gathered form the Facebook API in real time the data stored database used Apache spark to quick query processing the text partitions in each data nodes (machine). Also used Amazon cloud based Hadoop cluster ecosystem into processing of huge data and eliminate on-site hardware, IT support, and other operational difficulties and installation configuration Hadoop such as Hadoop distribution file system and Apache spark. By using the principle of decision dictionary, emotion analysis is used as positive, negative, or neutral and execution two algorithms in machine learning (naive bias & support vector machine) to build model predict the outcome demonstrates a high level of precision in sentiment analysis.",

        "abstract": "In the field of target-based sentiment analysis, the deep neural model combining attention mechanism is a remarkable success. In current research, it is commonly seen that attention mechanism is combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. However, such neural network-based architectures generally rely on complex computation and only focus on single target. In this paper, we propose a gated hierarchical LSTM (GH-LSTMs) model which combines regional LSTM and sentence-level LSTM via a gated operation for the task of target-based sentiment analysis. This approach can distinguish different polarities of sentiment of different targets in the same sentence through a regional LSTM. Furthermore, it is able to concentrate on the long-distance dependency of target in the whole sentence via a sentence-level LSTM. The final results of our experiments on multi-domain datasets of two languages from SemEval 2016 indicate that our approach yields better performance than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and several typical neural network models. A case study of some typical examples also makes a supplement to this conclusion.",

Twitter, the most commonly used microblogging tool, is used to gather information for research. Tweepy is used to access Twitter's source of information. Python language is used to execute the classification algorithm on the information collected. Two measures are applied in sentiment analysis, namely feature extraction and classification. Using n-gram modeling methodology, the feature is extracted. Through a supervised machine learning algorithm, the sentiment is graded as positive, negative, and neutral. Support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification models are used and demonstrated both comparisons. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\n The tree-structured neural network can deeply extract lexical representations of sentence syntactic structure. Some studies have utilized Recursive Neural Network to detect event triggers.\nMethods\n We incorporate the attention mechanism into Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs for the task of biomedical event triggers. Based on the previous research, we incorporated attention mechanism into Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs to assign an attention weight for the adjacent nodes to detect the biomedical event trigger words. The existing shallow syntactic dependencies in Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs ignore the deep syntactic dependencies. To enhance the effect of attention mechanism, we integrate the enhanced attention mechanism into the Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs model using the deep syntactic dependencies.\nResults\n Our proposed model integrating an enhanced the attention mechanism in Tree-LSTM on MLEE and BioNLP’09 both show best performance. The model also achieves the better performance on almost all of the complex event categories on the test set of BioNLP’09/11/13.\nConclusion\n We evaluate the model performance on the MLEE and BioNLP datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the advantage of enhanced attention to detect biomedical event trigger words.",

It finds and justifies the sentiment of the person with respect to a given source of content. Social media contain vast amounts of the sentiment data in the form of product reviews, tweets, blogs, and updates on the statuses, posts, etc. Sentiment analysis of this largely generated data is very useful to express the opinion of the mass in terms of product reviews. This work is proposing a highly accurate model of sentiment analysis for reviews of products, movies, and restaurants from Amazon, IMDB, and Yelp, respectively. With the help of classifiers such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree, the authors can classify these reviews as positive or negative with higher accuracy values. ",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of internet facilities has increased the comments, posts, blogs, feedback, etc., on a large scale on social networking sites. These social media data are available in an unstructured form, which includes images, text, and videos. The processing of these data is difficult, but some sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and recommender systems are used to process these unstructured data. To extract the opinion and sentiment of internet users from their written social media text, a sentiment analysis system is required to develop, which can work on both monolingual and bilingual phonetic text. Therefore, a sentiment analysis (SA) system is developed, which performs well on different domain datasets. The system performance is tested on four different datasets and achieved better accuracy of 3% on social media datasets, 1.5% on movie reviews, 1.35% on Amazon product reviews, and 4.56% on large Amazon product reviews than the state-of-art techniques. Also, the stemmer (StemVerb) for verbs of the English language is proposed, which improves the SA system's performance. ",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nAs the use of social media and other online forums for exchanging ideas and exchanging opinions has grown, so has the field of sentiment analysis. Many people use social media like Twitter and Facebook to share their thoughts and ideas with the rest of the world. Opinion mining or sentiment analysis focuses on classifying and predicting a target's opinion. Text documents or sentences can be categorized based on whether they represent a favorable or negative view on a certain subject. Text categorization may seem like an easy process compared to sentiment analysis, but numerous difficulties have prompted many studies into this area. The use of Firefly with Levy and Multilayer Perceptron approaches combined with a feature selection-based classification model to automate sentiment analysis has been proposed. Online product reviews can be improved by incorporating feature selection and classification into the SA model presented in this research. Feature extraction from online product evaluations was accomplished using the firefly (FF) algorithm, while sentiment classification was accomplished using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Four datasets are used in the experiment, and the outcomes are evaluated according to various criteria. As a result of these tests, it can be concluded that the FF-MLP model provided here has the best classification performance over the whole dataset tested.",

Tree-LSTM could improve the parallel speed of LSTM, and incorporate relevant information from dependency or syntax trees. Tree-LSTM can update gate and memory vectors from multiple sub-units. Learning edge features can strengthen the expression ability of graph neural networks. However, the original Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs ignores edge features during aggregating the sub-nodes hidden states.\nMethods\n we propose an interaction mechanism that can alternately updating nodes and edges vectors, thus the model can learn the richer nodes vectors. The interaction mechanism attaches the node embedding to its connected link at the first stage. Next, it superimposes the updated edge into the parent node once more. Repeat the above steps from bottom to top. We present five strategies during the alternant renewal process. Meanwhile, we adopt two constituent parsers and two dependency parser to produce the diversified formats, and compare their performances in the experiment result.\nResults\n The proposed model obtains the best performance compared with other methods on the BioNLP’09 and MLEE corpuses.\nConclusion\n The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the interactive mechanism. The parsing results have little impact on the final model performance, but different parsing formats have different results. CoNLL’2008 Dependencies show competitive and superior performance for each parser.",

        "abstract": "Film business and its individual reviews cannot be separated and film review sites such as IMDb is a credible source of reviews posted in public forums. With IMDb site reviews being unstructured and bias-heavy, classification methods by reducing additional sentiment bias is needed to create a balanced classification with lower polarity bias. Elimination of additional sentiment bias will improve the model as polarity is defined by non-bias method, resulting in models correctly defined which sequences of words is either positive or negative. This research limits the dataset by 50.000 rows of randomly extracted reviews from the IMDb website using dataset preparation methods such as Preprocessing, POS-Tagging, and Word Embeddings. Then preprocessed data is used in classification methods such as ANN, SWN, and SO-Cal. This paper also used bias processing methods such as Hyperparameter Tuning and BPM, with outputs evaluated using Accuracy and PBR metrics. This research yields 77.39 % for ANN, 66.32% for BPM,  75.6% for SO-Cal, and 76.26% for Hybrid classification. Best PBR resulted in two lexicon-based methods on 0.0009 for BPM, and 0.00006 for SO-Cal. More advanced model configuration in ANN can improve the model, and much complex lexicon models will be a future in the research topic.\r\n ",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet, the number of social media and e-commerce platforms increased dramatically. Users from all over world share their comments and sentiments on the Internet become a new tradition. Applying natural language processing technology to analyze the text on the Internet for mining the emotional tendencies has become the main way in the social public opinion monitoring and the after-sale feedback of manufactory. Thus, the study on text sentiment analysis has shown important social significance and commercial value. Sentiment analysis is a hot research topic in the field of natural language processing and data mining in recent ten years. The paper starts with the topic of \"Sentiment Analysis using a CNN-BiLSTM deep model based on attention mechanism classification\". First, it conducts an in-depth investigation on the current research status and commonly used algorithms at home and abroad, and briefly introduces and analyzes the current mainstream sentiment analysis methods. As a direction of machine learning, deep learning has become a hot research topic in emotion classification in the field of natural language processing. This paper uses deep learning models to study the sentiment classification problem of short and long text sentiment classification tasks. The main research contents are as follows. Firstly, Traditional neural network based short text classification algorithms for sentiment classification is easy to find the errors. The feature dimension is too high, and the feature information of the pool layer is lost, which leads to the loss of the details of the emotion vocabulary. To solve this problem, the Word Vector Model (Word2vec), Bidirectional Long-term and Short-term Memory networks (BiLSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are combined in Quora dataset. The experiment shows that the accuracy of CNN-BiLSTM model associated with Word2vec word embedding achieved 91.48%. This proves that the hybrid network model performs better than the single structure neural network in short text. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models use convolutional layers and maximum pooling or max-overtime pooling layers to extract higher-level features, while LSTM models can capture long- term dependencies between words hence are better used for text classification. However, even with the hybrid approach that leverages the powers of these two deep-learning models, the number of features to remember for classification remains huge, hence hindering the training process. Secondly, we propose an attention based CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model that capitalize on the advantages of LSTM and CNN with an additional attention mechanism in IMDB movie reviews dataset. In the experiment, under the control of single variable of Data volume and Epoch, the proposed hybrid model was compared with the results of various indicators including recall, precision, F1 score and accuracy of CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM in long text. When the data size was 13 k, the proposed model had the highest accuracy at 0.908, and the F1 score also showed the highest performance at 0.883. When the epoch value for obtaining the optimal accuracy of each model was 10 for CNN, 14 for LSTM, 5 for MLP and 15 epochs for CNN-LSTM, which took the longest learning time. The F1 score also showed the best performance of the proposed model at 0.906, and accuracy of the proposed model was the highest at 0.929. Finally, the experimental results show that the bidirectional long- and short-term memory convolutional neural network (BiLSTM-CNN) model based on attention mechanism can effectively improve the performance of sentiment classification of data sets when processing long-text sentiment classification tasks.

        "abstract": "As a research hotspot in the field of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis can be roughly divided into explicit sentiment analysis and implicit sentiment analysis. However, due to the lack of obvious emotion words in the implicit sentiment analysis task and because the sentiment polarity contained in implicit sentiment words is not easily accurately identified by existing text-processing methods, the implicit sentiment analysis task is one of the most difficult tasks in sentiment analysis. This paper proposes a new preprocessing method for implicit sentiment text classification; this method is named Text To Picture (TTP) in this paper. TTP highlights the sentiment differences between different sentiment polarities in Chinese implicit sentiment text with the help of deep learning by converting original text data into word frequency maps. The differences between sentiment polarities are used as sentiment clues to improve the performance of the Chinese implicit sentiment text classification task. It does this by transforming the original text data into a word frequency map in order to highlight the differences between the sentiment polarities expressed in the implicit sentiment text. We conducted experimental tests on two common datasets (SMP2019, EWECT), and the results show that the accuracy of our method is significantly improved compared with that of the competitor’s. On the SMP2019 dataset, the accuracy-improvement range was 4.55–7.06%. On the EWECT dataset, the accuracy was improved by 1.81–3.95%. In conclusion, the new preprocessing method for implicit sentiment text classification proposed in this paper can achieve better classification results.",

We incorporate previous researches on assigning attention weights to adjacent nodes and integrate this mechanism into Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs to improve the detection of event trigger words. We also address a limitation of shallow syntactic dependencies in Child-Sum Tree-LSTMs by integrating deep syntactic dependencies to enhance the effect of the attention mechanism.\n\nResults\nOur proposed model, which integrates an enhanced attention mechanism into Tree-LSTM, shows the best performance for the MLEE and BioNLP’09 datasets. Moreover, our model outperforms almost all complex event categories for the BioNLP’09/11/13 test set.\n\nConclusion\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed model with the MLEE and BioNLP datasets and demonstrate the advantage of an enhanced attention mechanism in detecting biomedical event trigger words.\n",

        "abstract": "Sentiment Analysis (SA) of medical reviews is crucial for improving healthcare outcomes. However, analyzing sentiment in low-resource languages such as Asian Hindi presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose an automatic graph construction approach to extract relevant features from medical reviews in Asian Hindi languages. We explore different types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), including traditional LSTMs, bidirectional LSTMs, and attention-based LSTMs, to classify the sentiment of medical reviews. Our proposed approach uses attention-based LSTM architecture and pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings to achieve high accuracy. We compare the proposed approach with existing models using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all existing models in terms of accuracy, achieving an accuracy score of 81%. These findings could have implications for improving healthcare outcomes by enabling better monitoring of patient feedback and identifying areas for improvement in medical services.",

Particularly, a sentiment and negation neural network (SNNN) is proposed, including a sentiment neural network (SNN) and a negation neural network (NNN). First, we modify the word level by embedding the word sentiment and negation information as the extra layers for the input. Second, we adopt a hierarchical LSTM model to generate the word-level, sentence-level and document-level representations respectively. After that, we enhance word sentiment and negation as attentions over the semantic level. Finally, the experiments conducting on the IMDB and Yelp data sets show that our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we draw the interesting conclusions that (1) LSTM performs better than CNN and RNN for neural sentiment classification; (2) word sentiment and negation are a strong alliance with attention, while overfitting occurs when they are simultaneously applied at the embedding layer; and (3) word sentiment/negation can be singly implemented for better performance as both embedding layer and attention at the same time.\n      \n    ",
