        "abstract": "This work proposes the application of several smart strategies for object manipulation tasks. A real-time flexible motion planning method was developed to be adapted to typical in-store logistics scenarios. The solution combines and optimizes some state-of-the-art techniques to solve object recognition and localization problems with a new hybrid pipeline. The algorithm guarantees good robustness and accuracy for object detection through depth images. A standard planner plans collision-free trajectories throughout the whole task while a proposed reactive motion control is active. Distributed proximity sensors were adopted to locally modify the planned trajectory when unexpected or misplaced obstacles intervene in the scene. To implement a robust grasping phase, a novel slipping control algorithm was used. It dynamically computes the grasp force by adapting it to the actual object physical properties so as to prevent slipping. Experimental results carried out in a typical supermarket scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning is a significant stage in the control of autonomous systems. As an alternative method, guidance approach is proposed for the motion planning of those systems. In guided munitions, guidance laws determine the success of the guidance systems designed to steer systems such as missiles and guided bombs towards predefined targets. The guidance laws designated according to determinative agents such as the firing position of the munition, target type, and operational requirements try to provide the munition with arriving at the target point even under the disturbing effects. In this study, the applicability of the guidance laws to autonomous systems is investigated in a manner similar to the approach for the guided munitions. For this purpose, the motion planning of the selected robotic arm, tracked land vehicle, and quadrotor is tried to be performed in order to move them to predefined target points. Having designed the control systems compatible to the selected guidance laws for the considered systems, the corresponding guidance scheme is constructed. Eventually, after conducting the relevant computer simulations, it is observed that the desired target chase can be made in a successive manner for all cases.",

        "abstract": "The chapter proposes a novel optimization framework to solve the motion planning problem of non-holonomic wheeled mobile robots using swarm algorithms. The specific robotic system considered is a vehicle with approximate kinematics of a car. The configuration of this robot is represented by position and orientation of its main body in the plane and by angles of the steering wheels. Two control inputs are available for motion control including the velocity and the steering angle command. Moreover, the car-like robot is one of the simplest non-holonomic vehicles that displays the general characteristics and constrained maneuverability of systems with non-holonomicity. The control methods proposed in this chapter do not require precise mathematical modeling of every aspect a car-like system. The swarm algorithm-based motion planner determines the optimal trajectory of multiple car-like non-holonomic robots in a given arena avoiding collision with obstacles and teammates. The motion planning task has been taken care of by an adaptive bio-inspired strategy commonly known as Bat Algorithm. ",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots have applications in military (for reconnaissance, search and rescue operations, bomb detection, surveillance), transportation (for cargo and packet delivery), data acquisition, etc. For the mobile robots to be able to execute these tasks with minimum or no human intervention, they need to be autonomous and intelligent. Path planning (PP) is one of the most critical areas of concern in the field of autonomous mobile robots. It is about obtaining a collision-free motion optimal path based on either time, distance, energy or cost in a static or dynamic environment containing obstacles. However, power limitation hinders the mobile robots to accomplish their task of reaching the target location as there are several paths they can follow. Each of these paths has its own path length, cost (i.e., time to reach destination), and energy constraint, thus, the need to plan for an optimal path according to a certain performance criterion. Significant research has been conducted in recent years to address the PP problem. Hence, this chapter is aimed at presenting the different approaches for PP of mobile robots with respect to different optimality criteria (time, distance, energy and cost), challenges and making recommendations on possible areas of future research.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a double-layer structure RRT* algorithm based on objective bias called DOB-RRT*. The algorithm adopts an initial path with an online optimization structure for motion planning. The first layer of RRT* introduces a feedback-based objective bias strategy with segment forward pruning processing to quickly obtain a smooth initial path. The second layer of RRT* uses the heuristics of the initial tree structure to optimize the path by using reverse maintenance strategies. Compared with conventional RRT and RRT* algorithms, the proposed algorithm can obtain the initial path with high quality, and it can quickly converge to the progressive optimal path during the optimization process. The performance of the proposed algorithm is effectively evaluated and tested in real experiments on an actual wheeled robotic vehicle running ROS Kinetic in a real environment.",

Most of the algorithms for motion control are implemented in terms of older programming languages and concepts. This paper illustrates the advantages of employing object-oriented principles in designing computational algorithms in robotics. The novelty in the proposed approach is the application of the Separation of concerns principle in solving the inverse kinematic problem for motion control of redundant robot arms along a prescribed path in task space. The obtained model is ready for software implementation that adapts to changes in geometry and motion control subject to different quality criteria.",

        "abstract": "To deploy Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) inside heterogeneous GPS-denied confined (potentially unknown) spaces, such as those encountered in mining and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR), requires the enhancement of numerous technologies. Of special interest is for UAVs to identify collision-freeSafe Flight Corridors (SFC+) within highly cluttered convex- and non-convex-shaped environments, which requires UAVs to perform advanced flight maneuvers while exploiting their flying capabilities. Within this paper, a novel auxiliary occupancy checking process that augments traditional 3D flight corridor generation is proposed. The 3D flight corridor is established as a topological structure based on a hand-crafted path either derived from a computer-generated environment or provided by the human operator, which captures humans’ preferences and desired flight intentions for the given space. This corridor is formulated as a series of interconnected overlapping convex polyhedra bounded by the perceived environmental geometries, which facilitates the generation of suitable 3D flight paths/trajectories that avoid local minima within the corridor boundaries. An occupancy check algorithm is employed to reduce the search space needed to identify 3D obstacle-free spaces in which their constructed polyhedron geometries are replaced with alternate convex polyhedra. To assess the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed SFC+ methodology, a comparative study is conducted against the Star-Convex Method (SCM), a prominent algorithm in the field. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed SFC+ methodology in terms of its computational efficiency and reduced search space for UAV maneuvering solutions. Various challenging confined-environment scenarios, each with different obstacle densities (confined scenarios), are utilized to verify the obtained outcomes.",

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a solution that can effectively deal with micro-scale unknown and uncertain environments. Nevertheless, DRL is unstable and lacks interpretability. Therefore, it raises a new challenge: how to combine the effectiveness and overcome the drawbacks of the two methods while guaranteeing stability in uncertain environments. In this study, a multi-constraint and multi-scale motion planning method is proposed for automated driving with the use of constrained reinforcement learning (RL), named RLTT, and comprising RL, a topological reachability analysis used for vehicle path space (TPS), and a trajectory lane model (TLM). First, a dynamic model of vehicles is formulated; then, TLM is developed on the basis of the dynamic model, thus constraining RL action and state space. Second, macro-scale path planning is achieved through TPS, and in the micro-scale range, discrete routing points are achieved via RLTT. Third, the proposed motion planning method is designed by combining sophisticated rules, and a theoretical analysis is provided to guarantee the efficiency of our method. Finally, related experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method; our method can reduce 19.9% of the distance cost in the experiments as compared to the traditional method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can help mitigate the gap between data-driven and traditional methods, provide better performance for automated driving, and facilitate the use of RL methods in more fields.",

        "abstract": "Motion control in dynamic environments is one of the most important problems in using mobile robots in collaboration with humans and other robots. In this paper, the motion control of a four-Mecanum-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot (OMR) in dynamic environments is studied. The robot’s differential equations of motion are extracted using Kane’s method and converted to discrete state space form. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is designed based on the derived mathematical model to stabilize the robot in desired positions and orientations. As a main contribution of this work, the velocity obstacles (VO) approach is reformulated to be introduced in the NMPC system to avoid the robot from collision with moving and fixed obstacles online. Considering the robot’s physical restrictions, the parameters and functions used in the designed control system and collision avoidance strategy are determined through stability and performance analysis and some criteria are established for calculating the best values of these parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed controller and collision avoidance strategy is evaluated through a series of computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy is efficient in stabilizing the robot in the desired configuration and in avoiding collision with obstacles, even in narrow spaces and with complicated arrangements of obstacles.",

        "abstract": " Mobile manipulation problems involving many objects are challenging to solve due to the high dimensionality and multi-modality of their hybrid configuration spaces. Planners that perform a purely geometric search are prohibitively slow for solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration space. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many variables but cannot represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required in manipulation. We present the FFRob algorithm for solving task and motion planning problems. First, we introduce extended action specification (EAS) as a general purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as conditions. We adapt existing heuristic search ideas for solving strips planning problems, particularly delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We then apply the EAS representation and planners to manipulation problems resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query roadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under different placements of movable objects. This structure enables the EAS planner to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric and kinematic planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal. Additionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has a finite expected runtime. Finally, we empirically demonstrate FFRob’s effectiveness on complex and diverse task and motion planning tasks including rearrangement planning and navigation among movable objects. ",
