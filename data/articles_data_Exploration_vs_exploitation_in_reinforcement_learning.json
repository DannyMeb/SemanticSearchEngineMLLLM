        "abstract": "The integration of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for tackling some challenges in RL, such as sparse rewards, lack of exploration, and brittle convergence properties. However, existing methods often employ actor networks as individuals of EA, which may constrain their exploratory capabilities, as the entire actor population will stop evolution when the critic network in RL falls into local optimal. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a Two-stage Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (TERL) framework that maintains a population containing both actor and critic networks. TERL divides the learning process into two stages. In the initial stage, individuals independently learn actor-critic networks, which are optimized alternatively by RL and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). This dual optimization fosters greater exploration, curbing susceptibility to local optima. Shared information from a common replay buffer and PSO algorithm substantially mitigates the computational load of training multiple agents. In the subsequent stage, TERL shifts to a refined exploitation phase. Here, only the best individual undergoes further refinement, while the rest individuals continue PSO-based optimization. This allocates more computational resources to the best individual for yielding superior performance. Empirical assessments, conducted across a range of continuous control problems, validate the efficacy of the proposed TERL paradigm.",

        "abstract": " Identifying subsurface resource analogs from mature subsurface datasets is vital for developing new prospects due to often initial limited or absent information. Traditional methods for selecting these analogs, executed by domain experts, face challenges due to subsurface dataset's high complexity, noise, and dimensionality. This article aims to simplify this process by introducing an objective geostatistics-based machine learning workflow for analog selection.  Our innovative workflow offers a systematic and unbiased solution, incorporating a new dissimilarity metric and scoring metrics, group consistency, and pairwise similarity scores. These elements effectively account for spatial and multivariate data relationships, measuring similarities within and between groups in reduced dimensional spaces. Our workflow begins with multidimensional scaling from inferential machine learning, utilizing our dissimilarity metric to obtain data representations in a reduced dimensional space. Following this, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise identifies analog clusters and spatial analogs in the reduced space. Then, our scoring metrics assist in quantifying and identifying analogous data samples, while providing useful diagnostics for resource exploration.  We demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow with wells from the Duvernay Formation and a test scenario incorporating various well types common in unconventional reservoirs, including infill, outlier, sparse, and centered wells. Through this application, we successfully identified and grouped analog clusters of test well samples based on geological properties and cumulative gas production, showcasing the potential of our proposed workflow for practical use in the field.

However, the traditional model is difficult to consider the multiple factors, which makes the prediction accuracy difficult to meet the real drilling requirements. In order to provide efficient, accurate and comprehensive information for drilling operation decision-making, this study evaluated the applicability of four typical regression algorithms based on machine learning for predicting pore pressure in Troll West field, namely SVR (Support Vector Regression), Linear regression, Regression Tree and Gradient Boosting regression. These methods allow more parameters input. By comparing the prediction results of these typical regression algorithms based on R2(R-Square), explained variance, mean absolute error, mean squared error, median absolute error and other performance indicators, it was found that each method predicted different results, among which Gradient Boosting regression has the best results, their prediction accuracy is high and the error is very low. The prediction accuracy of these methods is positively correlated with the proportion of the training data set. With the increase of logging features, the prediction accuracy is gradually improved. In the prediction of adjacent wells, the ROP prediction methods can achieve a certain prediction effect, which shows that this method is suitable for ROP prediction in Troll West field. ",

        "abstract": " There are many advantages of geothermal energy, as an environmentally friendly resource; however, for these benefits of geothermal power to be fully maximized, there are some problems that need to be addressed. The primary objective of this research was to examine the influence of intellectual property (IP) rights and economic growth on the geothermal energy output among the 27 European countries within the time frame 1990 to 2021. This study adopts auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL). The findings show that a significant increase in the geothermal energy industry sustainability can occur in EU14 emerged economies using IP rights than in EU13 emerging economies. The major contributions of the research are that among additional factors, intellectual capital, market size, intuitional quality, and economic growth contribute more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU14 emerged economies than in EU13 emerging economies. Results from the analysis show geothermal power sustainability among the 27 European countries could be boosted significantly by adequately putting in place the determining factors of IP as this will foster the attainment of aims behind the energy union by the year 2030. This will no doubt be of help in curbing climate change and environmental pollution in society. The projected calculations were validated through the three estimators adopted for this study, that is, the pooled mean group, mean group, and dynamic fixed effect. The policy implication pointed out by this study the European nations in this study need to make IP indicators to be more effective as this helps in achieving societal and environmental goals. Moreover, the authorities in charge of lawmaking in European countries should focus more on IP areas to ensure the sustainability of geothermal energy generation. Also, authorities in charge of policymaking in the European nations should foster commixture strategies that are sustainable in enhancing IP breakdown as this will assist in fostering geothermal power exploration, thereby reducing the need for fossil fuels which will also carbon dioxide emission in the years to come.

We consider complex exploration problems, where each agent faces the same (but unknown) Markov decision process (MDP). In contrast with traditional formulations of reinforcement learning (RL), agents control the choice of policies, whereas an algorithm can only issue recommendations. However, the algorithm controls the flow of information, and can incentivize the agents to explore via information asymmetry. We design an algorithm which explores all reachable states in the MDP. We achieve provable guarantees similar to those for incentivizing exploration in static, stateless exploration problems studied previously. From the RL perspective, we design RL mechanisms, that is, RL algorithms that interact with self-interested agents and are compatible with their incentives. This is the first paper on RL mechanisms, that is, the first paper on any scenario that combines RL and incentives, to the best of our knowledge. ",

        "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, the epsilon (ε)-greedy strategy is commonly employed as an exploration technique This method, however, leads to extensive initial exploration and prolonged learning periods. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue involve constraining the exploration range using expert data or utilizing pretrained models. Nevertheless, these methods do not effectively reduce the initial exploration range, as the exploration by the agent is limited to states adjacent to those included in the expert data. This paper proposes a method to reduce the initial exploration range in reinforcement learning through a pretrained transformer decoder on expert data. The proposed method involves pretraining a transformer decoder with massive expert data to guide the agent’s actions during the early learning stages. After achieving a certain learning threshold, the actions are determined using the epsilon-greedy strategy. An experiment was conducted in the basketball game FreeStyle1 to compare the proposed method with the traditional Deep Q-Network (DQN) using the epsilon-greedy strategy. The results indicated that the proposed method yielded approximately 2.5 times the average reward and a 26% higher win rate, proving its enhanced performance in reducing exploration range and optimizing learning times. This innovative method presents a significant improvement over traditional exploration techniques in reinforcement learning.",

        "abstract": " To achieve the carbon neutralization plan by 2060, China implemented the “Dual Control” ( Neng Hao Shuang Kong in Chinese) policy in 2015 by limiting the energy intensity and consumption, leading to forced slowdown of energy-related production and consumptions, which in turn hampered China's economic growth. The economic impact of energy shortage has been discussed in such studies as Cheng et al., the economic consequences of the new policy remain unanswered. In this article, we select China's provincial GDP and electricity generation data from 2001 to 2021 to perform causality tests and a double log model which delineates the nexus between GDP growth and electricity generation. We find that (a) electricity generation growth Granger causes GDP growth but not vice versa, and (b) a 1% increase in electricity generation growth will lead to 0.17% increase in GDP growth. The significance of the finding is: as coal still primarily fuels electricity generation, dual control will further hinder China's economic development sans significant enhancement of electric system or expansion of renewable energy, our findings thus support an upgrade of current grid network by China Power International Development; an expansion of renewable capacity such as a proposal of 400 GW new energy project; and construction of energy storage devices such as the CGD Group thermal storage System and Yingcheng Compressed Air Energy Storage System.

        "abstract": " The efficient extraction of gas from low-permeability coal seams is an urgent problem in coal mine safety production. The traditional gas extraction technology generally suffers from problems that limited penetration enhancement or extraction effect, low construction efficiency, large workload, etc. Thus, it is especially urgent and important to explore the new technology applicable to efficient underground gas extraction. In this paper, based on the principle of hydraulic fracturing to increase permeability, we innovatively propose a technique to enhance the effect of hydraulic fracturing to increase permeability and further improve the efficiency of gas extraction using the gas desorption activity of native microorganisms in coal seams. Herein, the composition of the primary microbial community of a coal seam in Xinji No.2 mine was analyzed by bacterial and archaeal 16SrDNA amplicon sequencing, the community structure of the main functional microorganisms was clarified, the optimal combination of functional microorganisms for organic matter degradation in coal seam under anaerobic culture conditions was obtained. Besides the Biolog microplate technology was used to screen the nutrients of the excitation carbon source to stimulate the rapid decomposition of coal organic matter by microorganisms and to define the optimal ratio of the excitation carbon source to microorganisms. Finally, the effect of this technology on the application of coal seam fracturing and gas extraction was tested through field industrial tests, revealing that the extraction effect of this technology was more significant than that of the common coal seam perforation extraction technology. The results of this paper provide a new technical idea for gas extraction from low permeability coal seams, which is an important reference value for subsequent similar studies. ",

        "abstract": "In this study, the energy performance analysis of a representative residential building located in Izmir, Turkey, was carried out, utilizing the DesignBuilder energy simulation program. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are modeled as detailed in Design Builder in order to consider parameters such as thermal properties of materials, duct layout and airflow dynamics of the system in detail in the analysis. The technical and economic analysis of transforming the building into a nearly zero energy building (NZEB) was performed for eight different retrofit scenarios, including passive and active energy efficiency measures. The most effective scenario, Scenario 8 (S8), reduced the building's annual net primary energy consumption by 96.08% to 7.45 kWh/m²/year. S8's annual CO2emissions decreased by 100.07% compared with the reference scenario, resulting in −0.042 kg CO2/m²/year. The overall energy performance class of the building was determined using Turkey's national calculation program for the preparation of the energy identity certificate. The energy performance class of the reference building was determined as D, and the class of the building designed according to S8 as A. Investment evaluations were carried out for the retrofit scenarios, revealing that the investment cost for S8, having the lowest net primary energy consumption, amounted to USD 17,565.87. This finding establishes S8 as a more financially viable option in the short term. This study demonstrates the potential of NZEBs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainable development goals.",

In the paper “Uncertainty Quantification and Exploration for Reinforcement Learning”, Dong, Lam, and Zhu study the large sample behavior in the classic setting of reinforcement learning. They derive appropriate large-sample asymptotic distributions for the state-action value function (Q-value) and optimal value function estimations when data are collected from the underlying Markov chain. This allows one to evaluate the assertiveness of performances among different decisions. The tight uncertainty quantification also facilitates the development of a pure exploration policy by maximizing the worst-case relative discrepancy among the estimated Q-values (ratio of the mean squared difference to the variance). This exploration policy aims to collect informative training data to maximize the probability of learning the optimal reward collecting policy, and it achieves good empirical performance. ",

        "abstract": " The Yushuwan fault is located in the transition zone among the Yimeng uplift, Jinxi fold belt and Shanbei slope in the northeastern Ordos basin and marks the boundary between Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata. According to the field geological survey and geophysical data, this study shows that the Yushuwan fault is a deep-cut northwest-southeast-oriented strike-slip basement fault. A total of 17 apatite and zircon fission track points show that the basin experienced several stages of uplift at 190 Ma, 150–170 Ma, 110–130 Ma, 60–80 Ma, and 20–40 Ma. The characteristics of the Yushuwan fault indicate that the northeastern part of the basin is not a simple slope but rather a step with a large drop. Therefore, in the area to the southwest of the Yushuwan fault, there should be high natural gas resource potential and good exploration prospects. The contour values of the magnetic anomaly on the southwestern side of the fault are high, and the contours are dense; in contrast, the contour values of the northwest magnetic anomaly are low, and the gradient is gentle. Therefore, the fault represents the eastern boundary of the Yimeng uplift, and restricts the eastward extent of the high magnetic anomaly zone in the Yimeng uplift area. ",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) are essential tools for a wide range of applications stemming from their ability to operate in hazardous environments with minimal human operator input. Effective motion planning is paramount for successful operation of AGVs. Conventional motion planning algorithms are dependent on prior knowledge of environment characteristics and offer limited utility in information poor, dynamically altering environments such as areas where emergency hazards like fire and earthquake occur, and unexplored subterranean environments such as tunnels and lava tubes on Mars. We propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for intelligent AGV exploration without a-priori maps utilizing Actor-Critic DRL algorithms to learn policies in continuous and high-dimensional action spaces directly from raw sensor data. The DRL architecture comprises feedforward neural networks for the critic and actor representations in which the actor network strategizes linear and angular velocity control actions given current state inputs, that are evaluated by the critic network which learns and estimates Q-values to maximize an accumulated reward. Three off-policy DRL algorithms, DDPG, TD3 and SAC, are trained and compared in two environments of varying complexity, and further evaluated in a third with no prior training or knowledge of map characteristics. The agent is shown to learn optimal policies at the end of each training period to chart quick, collision-free exploration trajectories, and is extensible, capable of adapting to an unknown environment without changes to network architecture or hyperparameters. The best algorithm is further evaluated in a realistic 3D environment.",

Aiming to develop a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system where the smart vehicle runs on stored sunshine and wind energy, and vehicle batteries store energy and release it to the electricity grid in peak demand periods. To achieve this aim, mathematical models for solar and wind systems were created and entire 24-h simulations were run for case studies of three smart vehicles, which were assessed for different scenarios and circumstances, using the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The estimated values obtained were home load 10 MW, power factor 0.15 MVA, industrial load 0.16 MVA, and smart car-to-grid, solar panel farm, and wind farm power of 4 MW, 8 MW, and 4.5 MW, respectively. Therefore, the hybridized wind-solar energy sources were applicable for all three smart vehicles considered. ",

        "abstract": " A stable power system is a desirable state for the optimal performance and delivery of electricity to the end-users. This study evaluates the effectiveness of grid contingency support devices in power system stability enhancement. The new voltage stability pointer (NVSP) was employed to optimally infer the flexible alternating current transmission systems devices through N − 1 contingency ranking. In this research, the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) was considered as a grid support device. The effectiveness of this technique was validated in R2018a MATLAB with the IEEE 30-bus system using different combinable contingency cases to ascertain the critical lines and vulnerable buses to outages. Based on the results obtained through the NVSP, buses 30, 26, and 29 were cited as STATCOM candidate buses for overall optimal grid performance. The results obtained from the simulation revealed that the total real power loss was reduced by 90.21%. Similarly, the voltage magnitude of the buses was significantly improved to a minimum of 1.00 p.u. after placement of STATCOMs. Further investigation on single STATCOM placement in the IEEE 30-bus system revealed that the highest level of voltage improvement, minimum level of voltage deviation and maximum active power loss reduction was achieved when the STATCOM was placed at bus 30. The overall assessment of the proposed technique yielded better results compared with other methods on the same test system. ",

        "abstract": " Through repeated interactions, firms today refine their understanding of individual users’ preferences adaptively for personalization. In this paper, we use a continuous-time bandit model to analyze firms that recommend content to multihoming consumers, a representative setting for strategic learning of consumer preferences to maximize lifetime value. In both monopoly and duopoly settings, we compare a forward-looking recommendation algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to a myopic algorithm that only maximizes the quality of the next recommendation. Our analysis shows that, compared with a monopoly, firms competing for users’ attention focus more on exploitation than exploration. When users are impatient, competition decreases the return from developing a forward-looking algorithm. In contrast, development of a forward-looking algorithm may hurt users under monopoly but always benefits users under competition. Competing firms’ decisions to invest in a forward-looking algorithm can create a prisoner’s dilemma. Our results have implications for artificial intelligence adoption and for policy makers on the effect of market power on innovation and consumer welfare.

        "abstract": "AbstractReinforcement learning often struggles to accomplish a sparse-reward long-horizon task in a complex environment. Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) has been employed to tackle this difficult problem via a curriculum of easy-to-reach sub-goals. In GCRL, exploring novel sub-goals is essential for the agent to ultimately find the pathway to the desired goal. How to explore novel sub-goals efficiently is one of the most challenging issues in GCRL. Several goal exploration methods have been proposed to address this issue but still struggle to find the desired goals efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel learning objective by optimizing the entropy of both achieved and new goals to be explored for more efficient goal exploration in sub-goal selection based GCRL. To optimize this objective, we first explore and exploit the frequently occurring goal-transition patterns mined in the environments similar to the current task to compose skills via skill learning. Then, the pre-trained skills are applied in goal exploration with theoretical justification. Evaluation on a variety of spare-reward long-horizon benchmark tasks suggests that incorporating our method into several state-of-the-art GCRL baselines significantly boosts their exploration efficiency while improving or maintaining their performance.",

        "abstract": " In recent years, renewable energy technologies (RETs) have become increasingly popular worldwide to achieve energy sufficiency, reduce reliance on conventional fuels, and mitigate their devastating environmental impact. Nonetheless, more appears to have stayed the same in emerging economies, such as Tunisia, as various barriers hampered the implementation of these technologies. Hence, the prime objective of this article is to conduct a thoughtful assessment of four prominent renewable energy options for electricity generation and explore the most potential barriers hindering their development in Tunisia. To do so, a two-stage approach was applied. First, CRiteria Importance Through Inter-Criteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) were used to evaluate the considered alternatives, namely solar PV, concentrated solar power (CSP), onshore wind, and biomass. Then, an integrated step-wise assessment ratio analysis and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach (SWARA-DEMATEL) was developed to identify the most relevant barriers. The related criteria and barriers were determined based on an exhaustive literature review and experts’ feedback. The obtained results indicated that solar PV and wind were the most promising renewable technologies, while biomass was the worst option. To validate the outcome and demonstrate the effect of changing input data on the final results, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out. As for the key obstacles, political instability, high upfront costs, and market access mechanisms were the most influential barriers. Hence, prioritizing different RETs and analyzing the inherent barriers to their utilization would offer insightful guidance to policymakers, enabling them to establish efficient strategies for overcoming these obstacles, and accelerating the deployment of these technologies in the country.

        "abstract": " The European geothermal heating market, at one time dominated by only a handful of countries, is set to experience a purple patch in the coming years as governments scramble to find an affordable alternative to expensive gas-fired heating. The primary focus of this study will be to investigate what effect will worldwide governance factors and economic growth on the geothermal energy output among the 27 European Countries from the time being 1996 to 2021. Using the autoregressive distributed lag, the findings shows that a significant increase in the geothermal energy industry sustainability can occur in European Union 14 (EU14) emerged economies using worldwide governance factors than in EU13 emerging economies. Among additional factors, instability in the political realm, regulatory issues in the area of quality, accountability, and voice-related issues, and the ability to curb corrupt practices contribute more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU14 emerged economies than in European Union 13 (EU13) emerging economies. On the other hand, government effectiveness contributes more positively to geothermal energy sustainability in EU13 emerging economies than in EU14 emerged economies. The finding implies that geothermal power sustainability in EU region countries can be significantly increased by mounting the level of worldwide governance determinants to achieve Energy Union aims by 2030. This will finally be spread to combat climate change and environmental pollution. All observations on projected calculations are valid. The confirmation was achieved with the aid of the three estimators used in the study which are the pooled mean group estimator, the mean group estimator, and the third one was dynamic fixed effect approach. This study recommended that these European countries need to put more effort in terms of being effective in worldwide governance indicators which will help in goal attainment at the societal and environmental levels. Those in charge of making laws in the European countries should get more engaged in worldwide governance scopes as this will assist in facilitating the security and sustainability of geothermal energy generation. Those in charge of making policies in the EU countries should as well lay more emphasis on the strategies that could be cointegrated and as well sustainable toward worldwide governance fractionation toward the achievement of the sustainability of geothermal power and this will drastically reduce the need or dependence on fossil fuel and emissions coming from carbon dioxide in the future time.

        "abstract": " In the current study, a new adaptive binned kernel density estimation method has been introduced. In the proposed new method, Fourier transforms have been utilized to accomplish the convolution rather than performing the convolution by hand. By utilizing the fast Fourier transform, direct and inverse Fourier transforms have been found in a relatively short amount of time when implementing the new method. Upon analyzing the computed results, it has been observed that the newly proposed adaptive binned kernel density estimation distribution curve exhibits a high level of smoothness in the tail region. Furthermore, it demonstrates a strong alignment with the histogram derived from the recorded ocean wave dataset obtained at the NDBC station 46053. These are the major advantages of the proposed new method comparing with other existing methods such as the parametric method, the ordinary KDE method, and Abramson's adaptive KDE method. The specific research gap identified in the field is that none of the existing methods can predict the sea state parameter probability distribution tails both accurately and efficiently, and the proposed new method has successfully addressed this research gap. Upon careful examination of the calculation results, it becomes evident that the projected 50-year extreme power-take-off heaving force value, derived using the newly proposed method, is 1989300N. This value significantly surpasses (by more than 9.5%) the forecasted value of 1816200N obtained through the application of the Rosenblatt-I-SORM contour method. The findings of this study suggest that the newly proposed adaptive binned kernel density estimation method exhibits robustness and demonstrates accurate forecasting capabilities for the 50-year extreme dynamic responses of wave energy converters.

Nowdays, investments in hydropower plants are re-gaining importance given not only its ability in supporting the transition of the electricity grid to get rid of dependence on fossil fuels but also in the provision of numerous other services. In particular, Brazilian hydropower plants contribute to multiple water resources management services such as flood and drought control, groundwater stabilization, water quality management, river navigation, irrigation, leisure and tourism and aquaculture around the country.

        "abstract": " By combining financial and macroeconomic factors with machine learning techniques, this research paper proposes a novel method for forecasting oil price movements in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Traditional methods generally struggle to capture the complex dynamics and nonlinear linkages in the oil market, which makes accurate oil price forecasting vital for decision-making in numerous sectors. In this paper, we offer a machine learning framework that leverages financial elements like stock market indices, currency rates, and interest rates, as well as macroeconomic data like GDP growth, inflation rates, and energy consumption, as predictors of oil price movements. These factors were chosen because of their significance and importance to the ways in which the oil market in KSA functions. We use several different machine learning techniques to construct the prediction models, some of which are regression-based (such as linear regression or support vector regression) while others are ensemble models (such as random forests or gradient boosting). The models are tested and refined using historical data spanning a sizable period of time and covering a wide range of market circumstances and pricing movements. Evaluation of the prediction models is carried out using conventional metrics like mean-squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared [Formula: see text], and their robustness is evaluated using sensitivity analysis and cross-validation methods. Incorporating financial and macroeconomic variables vastly enhances the accuracy of oil price predictions compared to models based purely on historical price data, as shown by the preliminary findings, which underline the superiority of our approach. The machine learning models exhibit nonlinear pattern capture and responsiveness to market fluctuations. Insights into the relative significance of various variables and their effect on oil price movements in KSA are also provided by the sensitivity analysis. By demonstrating the usefulness of machine learning methods for oil price forecasting, particularly in the context of Saudi Arabia, this research adds to the body of knowledge already available. Our findings have important policy and market implications for oil price forecasting, benefiting policymakers, energy market participants, and investors. To improve the models’ ability to forecast the future, researchers may want to consider including more variables in their analyses, such as geopolitical developments and technology advances. ",

In addition to that, rising energy demand, fuel price increases, the need for energy security, climate change, and means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions are significant considerations in all ethical discussions, particularly when considering the human right to food; there is a tension between the usage of land and availability of water and the human need for fuel, such as biofuel. Although biofuels have the potential to alleviate energy difficulties, producing and consuming such fuels raises social, economic, technological, environmental, and ethical concerns due to ethical aspects such as Rights, Duty, Virtue, Utilitarianism, and Sustainability. Furthermore, all participants bear an ethical responsibility to ensure that biofuels are produced and used appropriately, taking into account citizens’ rights to nourishment, well-being, and employment, the environmental sustainability of such fuels, as well as their capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the equitable distribution of such fuels’ costs and benefits. Using human food to produce biofuels has raised several issues since it may jeopardize the human right to enough sustenance for healthy living. In contrast, current biofuel production and use do not meet environmental sustainability requirements. ",

        "abstract": " This paper discusses an approach low-voltage ride-through control of a boost-converter for a two-stage grid-connected PV system under balanced grid voltage dips (BGVD). A combination of a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and constant power generation (CPG) to control the boost-converter, respectively, in normal operation mode and BGVD under rapidly changing climatic conditions is proposed. MPPT and CPG commands based on artificial neural network algorithms are developed. Their goal is to maintain the operation of the low-voltage grid-connected photovoltaic system under instantaneously BGVD. This approach ensures a balance between the PV power generation and the injected active power when BGVD appears at the common coupling point (CCP). It permits to regulate the PV power to a specific value, to limit the over current at the CCP and to avoid energy aggregation at the DC-link bus. Simulations of 2.5 kW of a two-stage grid-connected PV system to verify the effectiveness of the command approach are presented. ",

However, it involves great exploiting risks since it buried deep beneath the crust of the Earth. The location and depth of geothermal resources can be determined using the geophysical methods. Controlled source audio-frequency magnetotellurics (CSAMT) and transient electromagnetic method (TEM) have relatively high efficiency and robustness. In this paper, a simplified geothermal system resistivity model was established, which allowed TEM and CSAMT to differentiate target faults with various characteristics (resistivity, dip angle and width). Through a comprehensive electromagnetic exploration in Huairen County, Shanxi Province, China as an example, the performance of TEM and CSAMT in determining geothermal resources was evaluated. The results showed that both methods could examine the geoelectrical structures from various perspectives, and the effectiveness of comprehensive electromagnetic method for geothermal resources was presented.

        "abstract": " The interpretation model for gas saturation in deep clastic reservoirs subject to intensive extrusion stress relies predominantly on experimental petrophysical data and the expanded Archie equation. Nonetheless, these methodologies may not consistently yield optimum results. Specifically, when subsurface pressure impacts formation resistivity, the resulting curve values exhibit substantial elevations, leading to significant inaccuracies in the precise estimation of gas saturation from resistivity logging data. Consequently, the evaluation of logging interpretations becomes a complex undertaking. This paper aims to comprehensively assess gas saturation in deep clastic reservoirs from both electrical and mechanical perspectives. To achieve this goal, we employ a multifaceted approach encompassing the Archie formula, the stress-corrected variable cementation index saturation model, and the resistivity-corrected saturation model. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and the utilization of simulated experimental data, a quantitative relationship equation between resistivity and stress difference has been established. Building upon this fundamental groundwork, an innovative resistivity-corrected saturation calculation model has been proposed. In comparison to the two alternative models, the new model exhibits enhanced accuracy in calculating gas saturation, as it is less influenced by extrusion stress and gravitational compaction. Furthermore, it demonstrates better consistency with core mercury injection capillary pressure data in determining gas saturation. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for the effective evaluation of deep clastic reservoirs, offering a robust framework for advancing the understanding of gas saturation in the face of complex geological and geophysical challenges.

Through contact angle measurement, wetting heat measurement, and step-by-step release test to investigate the hydrophobicity of each particle size; in addition, the flotation kinetics test of different particle sizes coal slime was also carried out. The results show that the particle size has a significant effect on the flotation behavior of fine coal slime. The medium particle size −0.25 + 0.074 mm has the best hydrophobicity, followed by −0.5 + 0.25 mm, again −0.5 mm, and finally −0.074 mm particle sizes. Use Origin software to fit six kinetic models to the test data of coal slime flotation kinetics, and analyze the maximum combustible recovery [Formula: see text], flotation rate constant (k), and correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of each particle size, The results show that the first-order model with rectangular distribution of floatabilities can better describe the flotation of coal slime of each particle size.

        "abstract": "One approach to guaranteeing safety in Reinforcement Learning is through cost constraints that are dependent on the policy. Recent works in constrained RL have developed methods that ensure  constraints are enforced even at learning time while maximizing the overall value of the policy. Unfortunately, as demonstrated in our experimental results, such approaches do not perform well on complex multi-level tasks, with longer episode lengths or sparse rewards. To that end, we propose a scalable hierarchical approach for constrained RL problems that employs backward cost value functions in the context of task hierarchy and a novel intrinsic reward function in lower levels of the hierarchy to enable cost constraint enforcement. One of our key contributions is in proving that backward value functions are theoretically viable even when there are multiple levels of decision making. We also show that our new approach, referred to as Hierarchically Limited consTraint Enforcement (HiLiTE) significantly improves on state of the art Constrained RL approaches for many  benchmark problems from literature. We further demonstrate that this performance (on value and constraint enforcement) clearly outperforms existing best approaches for constrained RL and hierarchical RL.",

        "abstract": " The Earth's infrared energy storage is substantial, and its large-scale utilization could effectively ameliorate the greenhouse effect on Earth. Several applications of utilizing Earth's infrared radiation for cooling and power generation are summarized based on existing literature. Building upon this foundation, the use of water as an excellent energy storage medium is proposed, and a long-wave energy storage system is designed. This system can harness the immense energy density of long-wave infrared radiation with fixed bandwidth or wavelength. A comprehensive study on large-scale application is outlined in four aspects, leveraging the energy storage and radiation advantages of the system: (a) Long-wave infrared is efficiently transported using hollow glass infrared fibers for room cooling and heating. This addresses the issues of separate terminals for capillary radiation air conditioning, high costs, and maintenance challenges. (b) Building on existing literature, taking Hainan as an example, the utilization of a temperature difference of approximately 15 °C between the lowest and highest temperatures in a day for power generation is suggested. (c) The composition and structure of planar antennas are derived, and parameter selection for rectifying diodes is proposed based on radiation fluctuation theory and antenna theory. This lays a theoretical and practical foundation for converting long-wave radiation waves using rectifying antennas. (d) The long-wave radiation quantum theory is utilized to propose the concept of manufacturing components that can directly convert energy from long-wave radiation. In each of these four aspects of large-scale utilization, the emphasis is on water's excellent insulation, storage, and radiation properties, presenting new perspectives for the widespread utilization of Earth's infrared and offering a quick pathway for humanity to explore new energy sources and mitigate the greenhouse effect on Earth, facilitating a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.

        "abstract": " Storage systems are needed to boost the reliability of intermittent solar and wind resources in power networks. Rather than focus on one storage system or one hybrid energy storage system (HESS), this work models the operation of six HESS configurations in a Renewable Energy (RE) based grid-tied network. The objective is to minimise the daily operational costs of the microgrid while prolonging the storage lifetime by considering storage degradation costs. The influence of fixed tariffs and time-of-use (TOU) tariffs on the optimal operational of the HESS configurations have also been investigated; as well as deferrable demand satisfaction, charge-discharge pattern of different HESS and availability of the power-dense storage system within the microgrid. Results show that the lead-acid battery and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) HESS incurs the highest operational costs, while the supercapacitor-lead-acid battery HESS incurs the lowest operational costs. The supercapacitor-lead acid battery and the supercapacitor-HFC HESS incur the highest annual storage degradation costs. The grid expenses were seen to be the same for all HESS under each tariff scheme. Lastly, decreasing the minimum storage level further by 10% from the 30% in the base case, led to an increase in the number of hours of availability of the power-dense storage system of five of the six HESS. These results have given a deeper understanding to the operation of HESS systems and can inform better decision making of the suitable HESS to be deployed in different operating scenarios. ",

Our study targets improved energy efficiency for the EAHE system, focusing on cost-effective approaches to enhance its technical, economic, and environmental performance. The thermal performance and economic viability of the EAHE system hinge on the thermal characteristics of the surrounding soil. The EAHE model features a single pipe with dimensions of 0.5 meters in diameter, 1 centimeter in thickness, and 10 meters in length. These pipes are strategically placed at depths of 1 meter, 2 meters, 3 meters, and 4 meters below the ground's surface. To optimize heat exchange efficiency while minimizing pipe length, we propose using a secondary soil material with high thermal conductivity as a lining for the EAHE pipes. Our innovative approach carefully considers the economic and environmental aspects of various lining materials, resulting in optimal performance at a minimal cost. Extensive simulations and data analysis lead us to identify an ideal lining material, naturally available, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective, ensuring peak efficiency. Our investigation assesses the EAHE system's thermal performance for both summer cooling and winter heating, demonstrating its effectiveness across seasons. This research underscores the case for utilizing EAHE systems during winter and autumn for heating and during spring and summer for cooling. Our findings are supported by robust performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of our approach. ",

Results indicated that microporous diameter induced from the carboxyl (COOH) and hydroxyl (OH) was more sensitive to increasing temperature than carbonyl (CO) and ether (C2O). The COOH and OH could induce more micropores than the other functional groups. The adsorption capacities of OH-CV and COOH-CV were significantly higher than C2O-CV, CO-CV, and C-CV (coal vitrinite purified by carbon atoms) and they all decrease with the decreasing temperature. Both the calculation results of Locate- and Isotherm task suggested that OH and COOH have a significantly higher adsorption amount than other coal macromolecules and the others have a close adsorption amount. The adsorption selectivities of CO2 over CH4 ( SA/B) for all the functional groups were higher than 1 here, indicating the adsorption preference of CO2 over CH4. For the pressure dependence, the SA/B first decreases significantly for the pressure of < 4 MPa and then slightly for the pressures of >4 MPa with the increasing pressure, indicating that high pressure was not conductive to the replacement of CH4 by CO2. For almost all the pressures here, the SA/B follows the order of COOH-CV > OH-CV≈C2O-CV≈Ori-CV≈CO-CV≈C-CV, indicating the highest adsorption preference of CO2 over CH4 for COOH, and OH-CV. ",

Artificial intelligence applied to mobile robotics is also a distinct challenge; reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most used algorithms in robotics. The exploration-exploitation dilemma is a motivating challenge for the performance of RL algorithms. The problem is balancing exploitation and exploration, as too much exploration leads to a decrease in cumulative reward, while too much exploitation locks the agent in a local optimum. This paper proposes a new path planning method for mobile robot based on Q-learning with an improved exploration strategy. In addition, a comparative study of Boltzmann distribution and \n$\\epsilon$\n-greedy politics is presented. Through simulations, the better performance of the proposed method in terms of execution time, path length, and cost function is confirmed.",

        "abstract": " Renewable energy systems have emerged as a viable option to mitigate the environmental impacts of traditional fossil fuels. However, the intermittent nature of these renewables, such as solar and wind, makes it challenging to ensure a stable energy supply using only one type. Therefore, combining more than a single technology offers significant advantages in addressing the limitations associated with each individual system. Nevertheless, developing these systems requires substantial financial investments, making it crucial to identify the most suitable locations prior to installing them. In this article, the prime objective was to propose a preliminary evaluation of land suitability for constructing solar and wind hybrid facilities (PV–wind, PV–CSP, and CS–wind) in Tataouine, southern Tunisia. To this end, a GIS-based MCDA methodology was developed based on an extensive literature review and experts’ feedback while considering climate, topography, accessibility, and environmental factors. The results obtained revealed that the optimal area for a CSP–PV hybrid system is about 793 km2, indicating that this combination has the highest potential in terms of available resources and compatibility. On the other hand, well-suited locations for hosting CSP–wind and PV–wind systems covered areas of 412 and 333 km2, respectively. Such specific locations are capable of generating an annual technical potential of 316.169, 91.252, and 62.970 TWh for CSP–PV, CSP–wind, and PV–wind, respectively. Interestingly, comprising almost all of the most appropriate sites, Remada and Dhiba stand as the ideal locations for accommodating such hybrid systems. Considering this outcome, Tataouine can position itself as a model for renewable energy adoption in Tunisia. Therefore, it is imperative for policymakers, investors, and local communities to collaborate and embrace these hybrid systems to capitalize on this immense potential and pave the way for a greener and more prosperous future.

        "abstract": " Geothermal energy is a renewable energy that is environmentally friendly and will help reduce greenhouse emission resulting from the burning of fossil fuels. Nigeria has numerous geothermal surface manifestations like hot and warm springs in most parts of the country that has not been exploited or explored due to the initial high cost of exploration. Most research conducted on geothermal energy prospects in Nigeria considered specific geographical sections. Due to the geological features of Nigeria, the direct and indirect tectonic activities, there is the need to map the thermal anomalies over Nigeria to determine likely geothermal wells and ground heat catchment in Nigeria. Forty years remote sensing dataset (1980–2019), was obtained from the MERRA-2 for three hundred and two (302) locations across Nigeria. The acquired thermal parameters were processed using known models. The data was also analyzed statistically and spatially using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS). The results of show that the Gummel-Kumaganum areas of chad basin, Owode-igbo ora areas of the Dahomey basin, Belli area of the basement complex in Taraba state, potiskum areas of the Upper benue Basin, Ekpoma-kwale, itu areas of the Niger delta basin are middle geothermal wells with the terrestial radiation of < −702 W/m2 while the terrestial radiation >200 W/m2 in the Gummi area of the sokoto basin, Hunkuyi area of the basement complex in the northeast, Gashua area of the chad basin, Ozubulu-idah area of Anambra basin, Atijere area of the Dahomey basin, Agbasa, Omoko, Akamkpa area of Niger delta basin, Shaki area of the southwest basement complex are heat catchment regions. Other heat catchment areas had been identified for standalone energy generation. Also, the thermal anomalies in those areas were significant. The validation of the result was achieved via benchmarking similar geothermal well around the globe and ground truthing at Ijebu-Ode Nigeria. Based on the thermal reversal depth (TRD) concept, Ijebu-Ode may have a deep geothermal well with temperatures pattern similar to geothermal wells in other parts of the globe. It is recommended that ground measurement should be carried out in the basement complex to cater for geothermal systems whose mechanism is based on conduction. ",

        "abstract": " The ever-increasing electricity demand, its dependency on fossil fuels, and the consequent environmental degradation are major concerns of this era. The worldwide domination of fossil fuels in bulk electricity generation is rapidly increasing the emissions of CO[Formula: see text] and other environmentally dangerous gases that are contributing to climate change. The economic and emission dispatch are two important problems in thermal power generation whose combination produces a complex highly constrained nonlinear optimization problem known as combined economic and emission dispatch. The optimization of combined economic and emission dispatch aims to allocate the generation of committed units to minimize fuel cost and emissions, simultaneously while honoring all equality and inequality constraints. Therefore, in this article, we investigate a solution of the combined economic and emission dispatch problem using quantum particle swarm optimization and its two modified versions, that is, enhanced quantum particle swarm optimization and quantum particle swarm optimization integrated with weighted mean personal best and adaptive local attractor. The enhanced quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm achieves particles’ diversification at early stages and shows good performance in local search at later stages. The quantum particle swarm optimization integrated with weighted mean personal best and adaptive local attractor boosts search performance of quantum particle swarm optimization and attains better global optimality. The suggested methods are employed to achieve solution for the combined economic and emission dispatch in four distinct systems, encompassing two scenarios with 6 units each, one with a 10-unit configuration, and another with an 11-unit setup. A comparative analysis with methodologies documented in existing literature reveals that the proposed approach outperforms others, demonstrating superior computational performance and robust efficiency.

        "abstract": " In this work, a hybrid system consisting of a parabolic trough collector and a steam power plant is proposed. The effect of utilizing the parabolic trough collector on improving the performance of the plant and reducing fuel consumption has been studied experimentally. This study was implemented on a lab scale hybrid energy system consisting of a parabolic trough collector unit incorporated into a biomass-oil shale fired steam power plant during startup conditions. To determine the performance of this lab-scale hybrid system, the efficiency of the parabolic trough collector standalone system has been measured and the flow rate of the system has been tuned to 0.31 L/min to obtain an efficiency of 10.2%. The biomass-oil shale fired power plant worked with superheated steam at 377 °C temperature and 0.6 MPa pressure. The thermal efficiency of the power plant was 12.6% with net output power of 6.3 kW without using the parabolic trough collector unit. It was found that the performance of the hybrid system has shown better efficiency than the standalone biomass fired power plant with the same fuel mixture ratio and steam flowrate. The fuel mixture consumed in the hybrid system decreased by 62.0% at starting up condition. This result may be extended to steady-state operating conditions by increasing the number of parabolic trough collector units utilized. Furthermore, the overall thermal efficiency of the hybrid parabolic trough collector power plant system may reach 33.3% during steady-state operation if 48 parabolic trough collector similar units were used. These parabolic trough collector units should be arranged in three parallel rows, each row of 16 units in series. ",

To examine interconnections between state-level emissions, three different spatial panel data models are estimated: the spatial autoregressive model, spatial error model, and the spatial Durbin model models. This study makes contributions to the literature by applying a spatial panel data approach and including policies on urbanization and renewable standards. Urbanization is found to have a statistically significant, negative direct effect on emissions, yet a negative spillover effect such that a 1.0% increase in state i's urbanization level leads to a 0.30% decrease in its own state's emissions, but a 0.012% increase in an adjacent state j's emissions. Although state-level emissions are increased by higher energy use and coal consumption, both energy prices and renewable portfolio standards decrease emissions both within their own and adjacent states.

        "abstract": " The Turonian-Maastrichtian bituminous sands resource in the Dahomey (Benin) Basin, Southwestern Nigeria, is a potentially economically viable hydrocarbon reserve, which has recently attracted renewed attention. An integrated study involving the use of elemental composition, and geochemical analyses (gas chromatography flame ionisation detector (GC-FID), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)) were carried out to provide an improved understanding of this resource using geochemical signatures and evaluate the n-alkane distribution of bituminous sands to determine its aliphatic hydrocarbon distribution and the prevailing depositional conditions. Elemental composition shows the dominance of carbon ( Av. 79.8%). The atomic ratios of H/C and O/C, respectively, range from 0.05 to 0.11, and 0.04 to 0.08. SiO2 is the dominant oxide, with concentrations ranging between 73.15 and 80.50 wt. %, while Zn is the dominant trace element. Twenty-three aliphatic hydrocarbons: C10, C13, C15, C17–C37, were identified on GC-FID, with distribution showing predominance of long-chain n-aliphatics, with a Carbon Preference Index (CPI) value range of 1.01 to 1.02. A bimodal n-alkane fingerprint envelope is visible on GC, with maxima between nC16– nC18 and nC27, indicating varied contributions from both terrigenous and non-terrigenous (possibly marine algae) organic matter. Despite the biodegradation of n-alkanes, GC-MS chromatograms (m/z 256) show evidence of bicyclic sesquiterpenes (BSs) in the bituminous sands investigated. Infrared (IR) spectra show the dominance of the hydroxyl functional group, while 2922.2cm-1 and 2855.1cm−1 are common in all the samples, revealing the presence of residual organics. This study revealed that the bituminous sands are highly waxy in nature and derived from higher plants of both marine and terrestrial source input with more influence from land-dwelling biogenic sources under oxic conditions.

        "abstract": " This review presents a techno-economic analysis of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in the domain of generating sustainable energy and treating wastewater with the aim of attracting investors through research and development for residential and commercial applications. The operation principles and various MFC types, along with their advantages and disadvantages, are thoroughly considered. The efficiency of various MFC types is considered to present appropriate options for commercial applications. However, large-scale integrations face substantial financial limitations owing to the reluctance of investors. This review explores the cost-benefit balance associated with the operation of an MFC system. For encouraging investors, different cost variables, such as the initial investment, operating costs, potential electricity generation, and waste treatment capacity, are thoroughly considered. These variables are placed on the spectrum of a cost-benefit analysis to vitalize the economic feasibility of the MFC technology in various scenarios, considering an order of financial variables. MFC development at an optimized cost is the pivotal pre-requisite to secure a competitive advantage over conventional sources of energy with carbon emissions. Thus, this study is expected to prompt decision-makers to adopt the MFC technology at the commercial level. ",

        "abstract": " The energy industry, acutely sensitive to geopolitical shifts due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experiences sustained disturbances in global energy markets, reshaping global energy supply dynamics and significantly influencing global trade patterns. Utilizing static and dynamic GARCH-Copula models, this study elucidates the dependency between energy markets and related assets. The Copula function, when compared with the multivariate GARCH model, demonstrates distinct advantages, notably in delineating joint asset distributions, capturing market dependence's nonlinear traits, and highlighting robust tail correlation structures. Beyond the average inter-market dependence, its tail correlation offers a vital perspective on market risk. This research delves into the temporal and structural variations in interdependence between energy markets and related assets. It probes potential structural breakpoints in dynamic interdependence and pinpoints their occurrences. By focusing on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, this study offers a holistic view of the changing interplay between the energy market and other asset categories, providing pivotal insights for investor portfolio optimization, regulatory oversight, and risk mitigation. Moreover, employing wavelet analysis, this study examines the frequency domain traits of the interdependency between energy markets and associated assets. As frequency wanes, market price fluctuations become less pronounced. The continuous wavelet power spectrum indicates that price variations are predominantly mid to high frequency. Cross-wavelet transform results suggest that correlations between energy markets and related assets are more influenced by short-term perturbations than enduring shifts. ",

As carbon-neutral targets continue to gain momentum, green investments are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the relationship between green investment and energy efficiency. This paper aims to fill a gap in the macroeconomic literature by using a generalized method of moments (GMM) technique based on panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2019. The econometric results indicate that green investment is positively associated with energy efficiency. Additionally, green investment indirectly promotes energy efficiency by fostering technology innovation and research and development (R&D) intensity. The results also suggest that more advanced digital development is linked to improvements in energy efficiency. Furthermore, regions characterized by higher levels of digital economy exhibit a more pronounced contribution of green investment to energy efficiency. Based on these findings, this paper provides valuable insights for Chinese policymakers on green investment and low-carbon development. ",

        "abstract": " One of the primary things damaging the environment is the use of energy. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), electricity is the main source of energy in educational buildings. To conserve the environment, significant efforts are now being made to reduce energy use in general and electricity use in particular. To be sustainable, it is also vital to research the possibilities of employing solar energy in the higher education sector since it is also accessible in the KSA. The main motives behind this study are the low prices of photovoltaic (PV) solar systems globally and the existence of a new government system to benefit from solar energy in the KSA. The utilization of PV solar energy at Sulaiman Al-Rajhi University in the Qassim region was examined in this article. Two scenarios were considered: scenario 1, in which the entire roof of the buildings is covered by a PV system, and scenario 2, for securing electricity so that it is a nearly zero-bill campus (nZBC). The yield factors calculated for scenarios 1 and 2 are 1896  and 1922 kWh/kWp, respectively, while the capacity factor is 21.6% for scenario 1 and 21.9% for scenario 2. For scenarios 1 and 2, the systems produce 2,160,181 and 10,199,253 kWh of electrical energy annually, respectively. The production in the second scenario is about 113% of the load to reach an nZBC, compared to the first scenario's coverage of about 24% of the load. The levelized cost of energy was found to be between 0.026 and 0.028 $/kWh, with a simple payback period of 10 years for scenario 1 and 8.1 years for scenario 2. Additionally, the proposed systems’ environmental benefits were noted. ",

Efficiently coordinating resource allocation, exploitation, and management in the Cloud Continuum represents quite a challenge, which has stimulated researchers to investigate innovative solutions based on smart techniques such as Reinforcement Learning and Computational Intelligence. In this paper, we make a comparison of different optimization algorithms and a first investigation of how they can perform in this kind of scenario. Specifically, this comparison included the Deep Q-Network, Proximal Policy Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization, Multi-Swarm Particle Optimization, and the Grey-Wolf Optimizer. We demonstrate how all approaches can solve the service management problem with similar performance—with a different sample efficiency—if a high number of samples can be evaluated for training and optimization. Finally, we show that, if the scenario conditions change, Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based approaches can exploit the experience built during training to adapt service allocation according to the modified conditions.",

        "abstract": " The East African Rift System (EARS) is the youngest rift with the eastern and western branches, consisting of multiple secondary rifts. It is generally characterized by low extent of exploration and great exploration potential. Identifying the differences in hydrocarbon accumulation conditions in various rifts is very important in providing guidance for hydrocarbon exploration and selecting favorable exploration targets in this area. Based on the interpretation of first-hand seismic-geological data, and combining other materials such as commercial databases and open access literature, the structural characteristics of the main rifts in the eastern and western branches of the EARS are comparatively analyzed; based on the anatomy of the discovered hydrocarbon reservoirs, the rifts of the EARS are classified into four types depending on their structural styles, including double-fault type, simple single-fault type, single-fault transfer type, and single-fault terrace type, and the control of structural style over hydrocarbon accumulation in the EARS is discussed. In the Western Branch of the EARS, large rifts such as the Albertine Rift and the Tanganyika Rift are mainly of double-fault type and single-fault transfer type, and only some small rifts are of the simple single-fault type. The rifts in the Eastern Branch of the EARS are generally small; the rifts in the northern section of the Western Branch are mainly of the simple single-fault type, and those in the southern section are mainly of the single-fault terrace type. The hydrocarbon potential of double-fault rifts is the greatest, followed by that of simple single-fault rifts and single-fault transfer rifts, and the hydrocarbon potential of single-fault terrace rifts is relatively limited. The results obtained from a comparative analysis of the structures, sediment fills, and reservoir elements of various rifts show that the west side of the Albertine Rift, the southeast of the Tanganyika Rift, the Kerio Rift, and the land in the northwest of the Turkana Rift have great exploration potential.

        "abstract": "In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), performing actions requires consuming certain types of resources that are non-replenishable in each episode. Typical applications include robotic control with limited energy and video games with consumable items. In tasks with non-replenishable resources, we observe that popular RL methods such as soft actor critic suffer from poor sample efficiency. The major reason is that, they tend to exhaust resources fast and thus the subsequent exploration is severely restricted due to the absence of resources. To address this challenge, we first formalize the aforementioned problem as a resource-restricted reinforcement learning, and then propose a novel resource-aware exploration bonus (RAEB) to make reasonable usage of resources. An appealing feature of RAEB is that, it can significantly reduce unnecessary resource-consuming trials while effectively encouraging the agent to explore unvisited states. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAEB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration strategies in resource-restricted reinforcement learning environments, improving the sample efficiency by up to an order of magnitude.",

While Focused Crawlers (FC) deliver more specialized and targeted results inside particular domains or verticals, general search engines give a wider coverage of the web. For a vertical search engine, the performance of a focused crawler is extremely important, and several ways of improvement are applied. We propose an intelligent, focused crawler which uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to prioritize the hyperlinks for long-term profit. Our implementation differs from other RL based works by encouraging learning at an early stage using a decaying ϵ-greedy policy to select the next link and hence enables the crawler to use the experience gained to improve its performance with more relevant pages. With an increase in the infertility rate all over the world, searching for information regarding the issues and details about artificial reproduction treatments available is in need by many people. Hence, we have considered infertility domain as a case study and collected web pages from scratch. We compare the performance of crawling tasks following ϵ-greedy and decaying ϵ-greedy policies. Experimental results show that crawlers following a decaying ϵ-greedy policy demonstrate better performance",

        "abstract": " In today's world, there are many changes and transformations in different sectors of the economy, and today's world economy has become more dependent on each other. The economy of many developing countries is highly dependent on agriculture. In addition, in developed countries, the agricultural sector is of special importance, so they are currently turning to the production of more organic and healthy products. One of the reasons that caused the agricultural sector to receive more attention in the economy is the existential importance of this sector in providing the raw materials of a part of the industry and the food industry needed in that country. Accordingly, in this research, the optimal cultivation pattern is determined using a linear multi-objective mathematical model, including economic, social, and environmental objectives. Moreover, the uncertainty in the input parameters of the proposed model is considered, and a robust optimization approach is applied to deal with this uncertainty. After collecting the research data for the crop year 2021-2022, the proposed robust counterpart formulation is optimized using GAMS software. The numerical results show that increasing the level of conservatism in the robust model cause to decrease in the profit of agriculture as well as increasing the total consumed water. Moreover, the results of the current research can help the decision-makers of the agricultural sector in achieving the goal of obtaining the highest profit. ",

        "abstract": " Smart homes are at the forefront of sustainable living, utilizing advanced monitoring systems to optimize energy consumption. However, these systems frequently encounter issues with anomalous data such as missing data, redundant data, and outliers data which can undermine their effectiveness. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based approach for data imputation is specifically designed to deal with the anomalies in smart home energy consumption datasets. Our research harnesses the power of ANNs to model intricate patterns within energy consumption data, enabling the accurate imputation of missing values while detecting and rectifying anomalous data. This approach not only enhances the completeness of the data but also augments its overall quality, ensuring more reliable results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our ANN-based imputation method, comprehensive experiments were conducted using real-world smart home energy consumption datasets. Our findings demonstrate that this approach outperforms traditional imputation techniques like mean imputation and median imputation in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, it showcases adaptability to diverse smart home scenarios and datasets, making it a versatile solution for improving data quality. In conclusion, this study introduces an advanced data imputation technique based on ANNs, tailor-made for addressing anomalies in smart home energy consumption data. Beyond merely filling data gaps, this approach elevates the dataset's reliability and completeness, thereby facilitating a more precise analysis of energy consumption and supporting informed decision-making in the context of smart homes and sustainable energy management. Ultimately, the proposed method has the potential to contribute considerably to the ongoing evolution of smart home technologies and energy conservation efforts. ",

        "abstract": " Energy demand forecasting has been an indispensable research target for academics, which has led to creative solutions for energy utilities in terms of power system design, control, and planning. The usefulness of energy demand forecasting is confined to the power engineering industry but globally exceeds such outcomes to contribute to the environment and health sectors. Despite the large number of research projects published on this topic, the challenge of energy demand forecasting still exists, especially with the developments in modeling concepts via artificial intelligence, which motivates more attractive solutions for the variables involved in energy demand forecasting. Mathematical correlation or extrapolation-like methods cannot be effective in all situations; however, when a time series neural network is presented, most statistical, empirical, and theoretical problems can be easily handled. This paper presents a simple and easy-to-understand method for the next decade of energy demand forecasting based on a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network. From its time series past values, NAR structurally is an optimal predictor for a future variable. A publicly available data set for global energy consumption has been used to construct the network model with sufficiently accurate results. The evidence has appeared in precisely following the exponential trend of energy consumption as well as the regressions for training, testing, and validation, which ensures the model's robustness and avoids getting involved in overfitting. The proposed model concepts and results can be easily used in undergraduate engineering education, training graduates, and future research. ",

        "abstract": " The advancement of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies has led to an increased significance of shale gas as a vital energy source. In the realm of oilfield development decisions, production forecast analysis stands as an essential aspect. Despite numerical simulation being a prevalent method for production prediction, its time-consuming nature is ill-suited for expeditious decision-making in oilfield development. Consequently, we present a data-driven model, ASGA-XGBoost, designed for rapid and precise forecasting of shale gas production from horizontally fractured wells. The central premise of ASGA-XGBoost entails the implementation of ASGA to optimize the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model, thereby enhancing its prediction performance. To assess the feasibility of the ASGA-XGBoost model, we employed a dataset comprising 250 samples, acquired by simulating shale gas multistage fractured horizontal well development through the use of CMG commercial numerical simulation software. Furthermore, XGBoost, GA-XGBoost, and ASGA-XGBoost models were trained using the data from the training set and employed to predict the 30-day cumulative gas production utilizing the data from the testing set. The outcomes demonstrate that the ASGA-XGBoost model yields the lowest mean absolute error and offers optimal performance in predicting the 30-day cumulative gas production. Additionally, the mean absolute error of the unoptimized XGBoost model is markedly greater than that of the optimized XGBoost model, indicating that the latter, refined through the application of intelligent optimization algorithms, exhibits superior performance. The insights gleaned from this investigation have the potential to inform the development of strategic plans for shale gas oilfields, ultimately promoting the cost-effective exploitation of this energy resource.

At present, most of the studies on lithium in fly ash focus on the leaching process, while there are fewer studies on the activation mechanism of roasting. In view of the above problems, the roasting activation mechanism of fly ash in the Pingshuo mining area (northern China) is investigated, and the leaching process of lithium is optimized. The activation pretreatment that destroys an inert composition of fly ash is necessary. In this study, fly ash and a mixed roasting agent (Na2CO3 and K2CO3 mass ratio of 3:1) were mixed at a mass ratio of 2:1 under 950 °C for 2 h. The results showed that the leaching rate of lithium increased by 70%. Direct acid leaching experiments show that 90% lithium in fly ash is related to insoluble aluminosilicate minerals. The mineralogical analysis of the calcined product shows that the stable aluminosilicate minerals in fly ash disappear and form nepheline KNa3(AlSiO4)3 which is soluble in acid, and the percentage of nepheline in the roasted product controls the leaching rate of lithium. The kinetic analysis of the acid leaching process of the roasting product shows that the lithium leaching process is mainly controlled by chemical reactions. Under the optimal leaching conditions, the leaching rate of lithium is 87.41%. ",

This article established a main roof elastic mechanics model through theoretical analysis and obtained the stress expression of any point on the main roof, analyzed the stress distribution characteristics and fracture evolution law of the main roof, finally, and revealed the unloading mechanism of the overburden in the cutting roof of goaf by combining with field mining pressure data. The results show that the stress value on the main roof is related to the dip angle, the poison's ratio, and the geometry parameters of the working face. The main roof stress presented an asymmetric distribution in the inclined direction. The fracture mode of the main roof is the “U-Y” mode under the first weighting and the “L-Y” mode under periodic breakage. The pressure on the upper part of the working face increased, while the lower part decreased according to field mining pressure data. There are two reasons for the reduction of pressure in the lower part of the working face, on the one hand, the reduction of the area of the key block A leads to a decrease in load, on the other hand, the gangue filling and supporting effect of the lower part of the goaf. The surrounding rock of the gob-side entry is not obviously affected by the dynamic pressure, and the deformation is small, achieving a good retaining effect. ",

        "abstract": " When considering multiphase flow scenarios, the interpretation of petrophysical properties poses significant challenges for production forecasts and reservoir modeling. The findings of the numerical modeling were therefore subject to uncertainty because characteristics like relative permeability and capillary pressure curve were hardly ever bound by interpretations. The uncertainty may result in inaccurate predictions of reservoir performance and skewed perceptions of the reservoir. Due to the difficulty in directly interpreting such property from the available field data and the expensive cost of coring, analyses or experimental measurements to determine relative permeability and capillary pressure were infrequently carried out. Such a gap would be filled by a straightforward yet rigorous method. In this study, we develop production projections for a wide range of three-phase compositional volatile oil reservoirs. Then, we used an artificial neural network to figure out how petrophysical characteristics and production data relate to one another. The artificial neural network model was adjusted, and the final trained model was tested blindly to determine how well it predicted permeability, multiphase relative permeability, and capillary pressure data. For the testing scenarios, consistency is seen between the predicted values and the original ones, despite some mispredictions being present. To provide production projections that can be compared to those from the reservoir model that include the initial petrophysical characteristic, the anticipated properties are then propagated into reservoir models. The comparison findings show that for 65/59/34 out of 74 testing scenarios, the reservoir model with artificial neural network-predicted features can anticipate oil/gas/water output with < 20% inaccuracy. With the developed artificial neural network tool, the reservoir engineers can evaluate the three-phase relative permeability surface from rate-transient data conveniently improving the accuracy of the relative permeability data implemented by history matching or from core experiments which sometimes are extremely expensive. The findings of this study can help for a better understanding of the relationships between three-phase rate-transient data and the relative permeability surface as well as the horizontal/vertical permeability.

Understanding the influence of various heat sources on the air temperature distribution in the coal face can help us to determine reasonable working conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the coupling relationship of multiple heat sources and obtain accurate prediction results. In this paper, the finite volume calculation method is used to establish a numerical model of heat dissipation of surrounding rock considering the difference in thermal and physical properties of coal and rock in the coal face. And then, a high-temperature coal mine in the northeast of China is taken as an example to explore the airflow temperature distribution law of the coal face under the influence of the absolute heat source and the relative heat source via the finite difference method. Furthermore, an orthogonal test was performed to investigate the influence degree of major factors on heat exchange of the coal face through range analysis. This work supplements the existing numerical model and research, and provides a theoretical basis and more accurate practical methods for predicting the thermal environment of coal face, especially in high mining depth mines.

        "abstract": " Serbia's energy sector is heavily reliant on Russian influence. On the other hand, Serbia's status as a candidate country for joining the European Union (EU) membership requires active working toward diversifying energy sources of supply. In the past decade, Serbia has secured a reduced price for natural gas through a bilateral agreement with Russia, addressing the shortfall in its domestic production. The former agreement priced Russian gas at US$270 per thousand cubic meters and expired in 2021. The new deal links gas prices to crude oil and ranges between US$310 and US$408, maintaining its competitive position as one of Europe's lowest import prices. Furthermore, alongside the new gas pipeline for Russian gas exports, the EU is funding the construction of a new interconnector, both with entry points from Bulgaria. Serbia also faces significant dependence on crude oil, and this reliance is compounded by the inability to import it from Russia any longer. Opposite, Serbia is usually self-sufficient in electricity production which still remains under state ownership. The domestic exploration and processing of oil and gas, as well as the sole underground gas storage facility in Serbia, have partial ownership by Russian Gazprom while the transportation of gas is under the full control of the Serbian government. This Communication about the energy situation in the Republic of Serbia put particular emphasis on the evolving political dynamics in the global energy market with a specific focus on the Russia–Ukraine war. The topic is also linked to the contentious status of the southern Serbian autonomous province, recognized as an independent state by the majority of Western nations but not by Serbia. It is feared that Serbia's energy dependence on Russia could have significant ramifications for its EU candidacy. ",

While tools with a pre-defined logic are commonly used in the field of penetration testing, the continually evolving nature of the security challenge calls for models able to learn autonomously from experience. In this paper we build on previous results on the development of reinforcement learning models devised to exploit specific forms of SQL injection, and we design agents that are able to tackle a varied range of SQL injection vulnerabilities, virtually comprising all the archetypes normally considered by experts. We show that our agents, trained on a synthetic environment, perform a transfer of learning among the different SQL injections challenges; in particular, they learn to use their queries to efficiently gain knowledge about multiple vulnerabilities at once. We also introduce a novel and more versatile way to interpret server messages that reduces reliance on expert inputs. Our simulations show the feasibility of our approach which easily deals with a number of homogeneous challenges, as well as some of its limitations when presented with problems having higher degrees of uncertainty.",

As such, electric vehicles are the key to achieving sustainable development goals. This review article analyzes deeply the previous technical developments of electric vehicles, focusing on important topics like battery management systems, technologies of power electronics, techniques of charging, and the relevant algorithms and improvements. In addition, several critical problems, and difficulties are presented in order to pinpoint the gaps in the literature. To address the analysis of battery behavior, battery condition monitoring, real-time control design, temperature control, fault diagnostics, and efficiency of battery model are considered. This study highlighted the estimation techniques that predict the internal battery conditions such as internal temperature, state of health, and state of charge, which are difficult to be directly monitored and determined. A lithium-ion battery, a super-capacitor, and related bidirectional DC/DC converters constitutes the infrastructure of a hybrid power system. This review offers useful and practical recommendations for the future development of electric vehicle technology which in turn help electric vehicle engineers to be acquainted with effective techniques of battery storage, battery charging strategies, converters, controllers, and optimization methods to satisfy the requirements of sustainable development goals. Accordingly, this review article will be a platform and future guide for those who are interesting in the field of energy management and its development. ",

This study aimed to investigate the organic matter accumulation mechanism, and hydrocarbon generation and expulsion characteristics of the Xiamaling Formation, using various methods, including scanning electron microscopy, rock-eval pyrolysis, and elemental geochemistry. Multiple geochemical proxies indicate that Unit 3—Unit 1 of the Xiamaling Formation was deposited in a climate that alternated between highly humid and semiarid conditions, with the strong-to-weak terrigenous influx. The redox conditions of bottom water were undulatory oxic in Unit 3 and the upper part of Unit 1, but anoxic in Unit 2 and the lower part of Unit 1. Sulfurization of organic matter was the main reason for the high TOC content in Unit 3. However, the high TOC content in Unit 2 and the lower part of Unit 1 was caused by an oxygen-deficient water column. Unit 2 and the lower part of Unit 1 exhibit a significant shale oil potential owing to low maturity, high hydrogen index (HI) values, and prevalence of type Ⅰ, II1, and II2 kerogens. ",

The engine performance and emissions were evaluated. The teak sawdust pyrolysis oil was obtained from a single-stage fixed bed pyrolysis reactor at 600 °C. Its physicochemical properties were characterized and found to be acceptable for the engine. Teak sawdust pyrolysis oil blends with diesel at the ratios of 10%, 25%, and 50% by mass were utilized. The small engine was tested at constant speeds from 800 to 2600 r/min. 25% teak sawdust pyrolysis oil blend at 2000 r/min was found to have better brake thermal efficiency with lower brake-specific fuel consumption compared to the other teak sawdust pyrolysis oil blends. Meanwhile, the highest engine load was obtained at 50% teak sawdust pyrolysis oil blend and 2600 r/min to be 8 kW. Furthermore, the emissions of CO, CO2, and hydrocarbon at 50% teak sawdust pyrolysis oil and 2000 r/min were slightly lower than other teak sawdust pyrolysis oil blends, no NOx detection in tested fuels, moreover, at 2600 speed, the smoke opacities of the fuels show lower than those the others. It was noted that a blend of 25% teak sawdust pyrolysis oil with diesel was suitable for the small engine (at 2000 r/min) in terms of performance and CO, CO2, and NOX emission for sustainability in agriculture and rural areas.

        "abstract": " Water inrush from coal floor is a gradual process from generation, and development to disaster. In this process, the geophysical information received by the rock mass will show measurable characteristics of the sudden, and the occurrence of water inrush is the inevitable reflection of various characteristics of the sudden in the limit state. In order to study the early warning information before water inrush in working face, based on the fluid-solid coupling theory, similar simulation test and FLAC3D simulation were used to reproduce the water inrush process of the floor fracture structure, to clarify the difference of response characteristics of each physical quantity before and after water inrush, and to calculate the weight value of different physical quantities in the water inrush process combined with entropy method. The results show that when the working face is gradually approaching the penetrating fault, the stress at the water inrush position of the floor rock layer decreases sharply, and the step jump change occurs after reaching the minimum peak value. The water flow shows a stable increase–sudden increase process. Water inrush through fault location water flow presents increasing—stability—the changing process of surge, water pressure appears cliff-like drop. In the sub-emergent stage when water inrush is about to occur in the working face, the variation range of stress and water pressure at the position of water inrush is more intense. The increase rate of stress at the position of water inrush in the floor rock layer increases sharply and reaches the peak value in a short time, while the increase rate of water pressure at the position of water inrush through the fault decreases.

        "abstract": "Traditional backward recursion methods face a fundamental challenge in solving Markov Decision Processes (MDP), where there exists a contradiction between the need for knowledge of optimal expected payoffs and the inability to acquire such knowledge during the decision-making process. To address this challenge and strike a reasonable balance between exploration and exploitation in the decision process, this paper proposes a novel model known as Temporal Error-based Adaptive Exploration (TEAE). Leveraging reinforcement learning techniques, TEAE overcomes the limitations of traditional MDP solving methods. TEAE exhibits dynamic adjustment of exploration probabilities based on the agent’s performance, on the one hand. On the other hand, TEAE approximates the optimal expected payoff function for subprocesses after specific states and times by integrating deep convolutional neural networks to minimize the temporal difference error between the dual networks. Furthermore, the paper extends TEAE to DQN-PER and DDQN-PER methods, resulting in DQN-PER-TEAE and DDQN-PER-TEAE variants, which not only demonstrate the generality and compatibility of the TEAE model with existing reinforcement learning techniques but also validate the practicality and applicability of the proposed approach in a broader MDP reinforcement learning context. To further validate the effectiveness of TEAE, the paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics, compares its performance with other MDP reinforcement learning methods, and conducts case studies. Ultimately, simulation results and case analyses consistently indicate that TEAE exhibits higher efficiency, highlighting its potential in driving advancements in the field.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has gained significant popularity due to its success in various cooperative multi-agent tasks. However, exploration still remains a challenging problem in MARL due to the partial observability of the agents and the exploration space that can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases. Firstly, in order to address the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations. Numerical results show that the proposed FoX framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on Google Research Football (GRF) and sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC) tasks.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe application of reinforcement learning (RL) to the field of autonomous robotics has high requirements about sample efficiency, since the agent expends for interaction with the environment. One method for sample efficiency is to extract knowledge from existing samples and used to exploration. Typical RL algorithms achieve exploration using task-specific knowledge or adding exploration noise. These methods are limited to current policy improvement level and lack of long-term planning. We propose a novel active exploration deep RL algorithm for the continuous action space problem named active exploration deep reinforcement learning (AEDRL). Our method uses the Gaussian process to model dynamic model, enabling the probability description of prediction sample. Action selection is formulated as the solution of the optimization problem. Thus, the optimization objective is specifically designed for selecting samples that can minimize the uncertainty of the dynamic model. Active exploration is achieved through long-term optimized action selection. This long-term considered action exploration method is more guidance for learning. Enable intelligent agents to explore more interesting action spaces. The proposed AEDRL algorithm is evaluated on several robotic control task including classic pendulum problem and five complex articulated robots. The AEDRL can learn a controller using fewer episodes and demonstrates performance and sample efficiency.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies safe Reinforcement Learning (safe RL) with linear function approximation and under hard instantaneous constraints where unsafe actions must be avoided at each step. Existing studies have considered safe RL with hard instantaneous constraints, but their approaches rely on several key assumptions: (i) the RL agent knows a safe action set for every state or knows a safe graph in which all the state-action-state triples are safe, and (ii) the constraint/cost functions are linear. In this paper, we consider safe RL with instantaneous hard constraints without assumption (i) and generalize (ii) to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Our proposed algorithm, LSVI-AE, achieves O(√{d³H⁴K}) regret and O(H √{dK})  hard constraint violation when the cost function is linear and O(H?ₖ √{K}) hard constraint violation when the cost function belongs to RKHS. Here K is the learning horizon, H is the length of each episode, and ?ₖ is the information gain w.r.t the kernel used to approximate cost functions. Our results achieve the optimal dependency on the learning horizon K, matching the lower bound we provide in this paper and demonstrating the efficiency of LSVI-AE. Notably, the design of our approach encourages aggressive policy exploration, providing a unique perspective on safe RL with general cost functions and no prior knowledge of safe actions,  which may be of independent interest.",

Furthermore, it classifies and evaluates the factors influencing on energy consumption in Punjab province thru a sustainable way. The growth consumption is classified into scale influence, structure influence, and efficiency influence. Likewise, the long-term energy alternatives planning-Punjab model is executed with the energy consumption, scale impact, structure impact, and efficiency impact. Besides, comprehensive adjustment scenarios are also introduced to examine the impact of three different factors on overall energy usage. The results from the qualitative decomposition of LMDI indicate that the high scale can lead to high-energy consumption in Punjab Province. However, it can be reduced by high-efficiency reinforcement. The total energy consumption in 2024, 2036, and 2044 under reference scenario is 304.12, 460.01, and 590.04 million tons compared to structure influence analysis for slow terminology (SIAS) and comprehensive scenario. For that reason, it can predict and provide earlier energy management planning for the province. Conversely, the structure factor does not display obvious effect on the energy use. Equally, the quantitative results of the long-term energy alternative planning (LEAP) model are relatively consistent with those of LMDI model, whose advantageous impact on the structure influence is reasonably extrapolated. This phenomenon indicates that the structure influence and efficiency influence will maintain the disruptive impact on increasing overall energy use for the future perspectives. Consequently, the LEAP model predicts the energy consumption of Punjab Province among the years of 2020 to 2040 under medium-term development framework. ",

        "abstract": " The Chang 8 reservoir of the Maling Oilfield in the Ordos Basin, China is facing a series of challenges in hydrocarbon resource development, including rapidly decreasing production rates, declining dynamic fluid levels, and elevated water cuts in oil wells, along with heterogeneity in microscopic pore-throat structures and notable interstratal inconsistencies. To systematically address these issues, this study selected representative samples from the reservoir and conducted rigorous microscopic percolation experiments on them. A comprehensive evaluation of the heterogeneity in microscopic pore structures was conducted using an integrative methodological approach, involving physical property quantification, petrographic thin-section analysis, scanning electron microscopy, constant-rate mercury intrusion, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The primary objective of this investigation is to elucidate the underlying formation mechanisms, states of occurrence, and spatial distributions of residual oil. Understanding of these issues will facilitate the establishment of empirical correlations between diverse microscopic pore structures and water-flooding efficiencies, and aid in the identification of key variables governing the distribution of residual oil. Analytical outcomes reveal substantial variations in seepage characteristics contingent upon the nature of microscopic seepage conduits. Specifically, the Chang 8 reservoir manifests four discernible categories of microscopic seepage pathways: solely intergranular pores, a confluence of dissolution and intergranular pores, exclusively dissolution pores, and micropores. A correlative decline in oil displacement efficiency is observed across these conduit types. Critical variables such as throat radius and its distribution patterns emerge as pivotal determinants influencing oil displacement efficiency, eclipsing the impact of conventional physical properties and mobile fluid saturation levels. Remarkably, samples characterized by a composite of dissolution and intergranular pores demonstrate superior displacement efficiency. Distinct types of pore structures correspond to noticeably different water-flooding oil pathways and oil displacement efficiencies. During the water-flooding process, fingering network displacement is dominant, and it exerts a significant control on oil displacement efficiency. Key factors affecting this efficiency include the injected water volume multiples and displacement pressure, values of which should be optimized during the actual water-flooding process. ",

        "abstract": " How to improve the heat extraction performance of HDR (hot dry rock) is one of the most concerned problems in HDR extraction. The key is to take a reasonable method to evaluate the heat extraction performance of hot dry rock and find out the main factors influencing the heat extraction performance of hot dry rock. The permeability of HDR reservoir, well type, well spacing, well pattern and injection flow rate of cold water have important influence on heat extraction performance of HDR reservoir. Based on this, a multi-field coupling mathematical model for injection and production of HDR is established and solved by finite element method to analyze the evolutions of seepage field, temperature field and stress field in HDR reservoir. Then, high temperature production time and heat extraction rate were introduced to quantitatively evaluate the heat extraction performance of HDR reservoir under different reservoir permeability, different well type, different well spacing, different well pattern and different injection flow rate. The research results show that different reservoir permeability has little influence on the heat extraction performance of HDR reservoir. Comparing the vertical well production system with the horizontal well production system, horizontal well production system has longer high temperature production time, and vertical well production system has higher heat extraction rate. The greater the well spacing and injection flow rate, the better the heat extraction performance of HDR reservoir. The heat extraction performance of the well pattern is not necessarily better than that of the one-injection and one-production well pattern, the heat extraction performance of the one-injection two-production well pattern and the two-injection one-production well pattern is worse than that of the one-injection one-production well pattern, and the heat extraction performance of the four-injection one-production well pattern and the one-injection four-production well pattern is better than that of the one-injection one-production well pattern. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for the formulation of economic and reasonable HDR development program and working system, and realize efficient utilization of HDR reservoir. ",

        "abstract": " China has recently faced significant difficulties in the exploitation of its shale oil and gas resources. An essential geological obstacle preventing the breakthrough of Chinese shale oil exploration is the precise identification of productive oil and gas pools and ideal formation. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the properties of shale reservoirs. Deep-water fine-grained sedimentary rocks in the lower member of the Well FY1 in Dongying Sag are analyzed using the Milankovitch cycle based on core, geochemical analysis, and gamma logging data. The findings demonstrate that: (1) The entire Milankovitch cycle is preserved in the Es3x of Well FY1 in Dongying Sag, and that the long Eccentricity of 405 ka and the Precession cycle of 23.2 ka are the key controlling factors in the deposition. (2) The “three-end-member” method is used to divide eight different types of lithofacies. The main vertical changes in these lithofacies are from organic massive gray mudstone to organic lamellar callitic mudstone to organic massive gray mudstone to organic lamellar gray mudstone to organic lamellar gray mudstone and back again. From shallow to deep to deeper, the entire water depth fluctuated. (3) Each of the four lengthy Eccentricity cycles has a half-cycle of warm, humid weather and cold, dry weather. Analysis was done on how the lithofacies and organic matter concentration changed with high and small eccentricities. The enrichment of biological materials in warm, wet, dry, and cold climates was hypothesized by examining the response of fine-grain sedimentary rocks to eccentricities and Precession periods. Larger Eccentricity is thought to be more suitable for storing shale oil. ",

In order to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the peat formation, nine samples were collected, and were analyzed using microscope, column chromatography, gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). According to the results of the microscopic analysis, the average random vitrinite reflectance ( Rr) is 0.73%, indicating a low rank bituminous coal. Vitrinite group is the predominant macerals with an average content of 54.54%, followed by inertinite group with an average of 35.99%. The higher inertinite contents indicate widespread wildfire events during the peat formation. The distribution pattern of n-alkanes, the cross plot between Pr/ n-C17 and Ph/ n-C18, the lower saturated/aromatic hydrocarbon ratios (0.22–0.68) and the presence of cadalene, retene, simonellite indicates that the organic matter is predominantly terrestrial higher plants with a small amount of aquatic organisms. The ternary diagram of Pr/Ph, Pr/ n-C17 and Ph/ n-C18 and the relative abundance of fluorene, dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene indicate a continental–oceanic alternative facies. The higher contents of combustion-derived PAHs are also indicative of widespread wildfire events during peat formation. ",

Constraining the oil sources and characterizing their accumulation patterns is a critical challenge. In this study, 46 crude oils from the Upper Wuerhe Formation, a widely distributed oil reservoir in the Mahu Sag of the Junggar Basin, NW China, are geochemically characterized to assess their sources and spatial distribution. These oils are divided into four groups: group I oils (characterized by high β-carotane and gammacerane concentrations, low C21/C23 and (C19 + C20)/C23 tricyclic terpane ratios, and low Pr/Ph ratios); group II oils (characterized by low β-carotane and gammacerane concentrations, high C21/C23 and (C19 + C20)/C23 tricyclic terpane ratios, and moderate Pr/Ph ratios); group III oils (very high Pr/Ph ratio (>3), the lowest β-carotane and gammacerane concentrations, and low tricyclic terpane concentration, but relatively high C19 and C20 tricyclic terpane abundance); and group IV oils (refered to here as geochemically hybrid, and inferred to be sourced from mixed P1f and C/P1j source rocks). The integration of oil-source correlation and geological framework indicates that oils generated from multiple kitchens are more likely to be near-sourced accumulations, providing a plausible example for oil accumulation in a complex oil reservoir of superimposed basin with several sets of kitchens and multistage oil charging history. The results show that multisource and multistage hydrocarbon accumulation is a common characteristic of prolific superimposed basins. The oil accumulation pattern must be established by carefully characterizing sources and charging processes to reduce the risk of exploration activities. ",

Climate data of the 2021 year were used to evaluate energy generation, different types of performance, and efficiency. The average annual yield, corrected yield, array, and final yields were 6.45 h/day, 6.18 h/day, 5.16 h/day, and 4.97 h/day, respectively. The overall annual mean capacity factor and efficiency ratios were 20.73% and 77.22%, correspondingly. Experimental data were analyzed and correlated by multivariate linear regression (MLR) prediction and simulation to validate models. The MLR analysis showed that the efficiency is highly dependent on the temperature of the PV modules and that climatic parameters significantly affect the efficiency and output electric power. The prediction models for PV module efficiency, system efficiency, and direct current energy exhibit an uncertainty of ±1.04%, ±0.57%, and ±35.38 kWh, one-to-one. The monthly generation was compared with results obtained by Energy3D simulation-free software, showing an absolute error of ±2.33 kWh. This information can be used as a methodological tool for predicting efficiency and power generation in direct current. ",

        "abstract": " In order to accurately predict reservoirs with similar physical properties between sandstone and surrounding rocks, this study takes Carboniferous-Permian system in southeastern Ordos Basin as an example, and puts forward a multi-attribute probabilistic neural network prediction method based on acoustic time difference compaction correction. Firstly, the time-frequency analysis method is used to divide the frequency of the original acoustic time difference curve, and the low-frequency long-trend correction of all wells is carried out based on the low-frequency components of standard wells. Then, it is frequency-divided and fused with the original high-frequency components to form new acoustic time difference data, and the long-term trend decompaction correction of acoustic time difference is completed, so that the overlapping area of acoustic time difference between reservoir and surrounding rock is reduced. Multi-attribute probabilistic neural network is an algorithm based on sampling points, before reservoir prediction, inversion parameters must be optimized to save calculation time and reduce prediction error. There is a high correlation between longitudinal velocity and lithologic change trend on the inversion profile of sound velocity. The comparison results of various inversions show that the velocity profile of multi-attribute probabilistic neural network has the highest coincidence rate and high resolution with the velocity curve of logging acoustic wave. The example shows that this method has high accuracy in predicting reservoir thickness, especially for the strata with little difference in physical properties between reservoir and surrounding rock.

The mechanical parameters and crack development law of roadway surrounding rock were studied by laboratory experiments. The mechanical model was established by the method of theoretical analysis, the maximum empty roof distance was deduced, and two support schemes were designed. Through the numerical simulation method, the support scheme was compared and analyzed, the deformation rule of roadway surrounding rock, the optimization of roadway support parameters and the application of hysteresis technology are studied. The effect of different support schemes was verified by three-dimensional similar simulation experiments. The practical engineering verification showed that the construction time of each support circle was reduced by approximately 1 h, and the work was completed 60 days earlier. The research showed that the optimal support scheme was support scheme 1 (7 bolts with 800 mm × 1000 mm spacing between the roof, 10 bolts with 800 mm × 1000 mm spacing between the two sides, and 2 × 1 × 2 cables with 1600 mm × 2000 mm spacing between the roof). Support scheme 1 was applied to the engineering site to control the deformation of surrounding rock at 80 mm, and the deformation was less than the original support scheme. The construction was completed in advance under the hysteresis process, and the support efficiency and operation safety were improved. The results revealed the mechanism of surrounding rock control and proved the effectiveness of digging support synergy. This optimization plan serves as a reference for studying roadway support in rapid excavation and provides theoretical support for safe and efficient coal roadway mining. ",

However, most RL frameworks oversimplify the problem by assuming a fixed-yet-known environment and often have difficulty being generalized to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we address a new challenge with a more realistic setting, Incremental Reinforcement Learning, where the search space of the Markov Decision Process continually expands. While previous methods usually suffer from the lack of efficiency in exploring the unseen transitions, especially with increasing search space, we present a new exploration framework named Dual-Adaptive ϵ-greedy Exploration (DAE) to address the challenge of Incremental RL. Specifically, DAE employs a Meta Policy and an Explorer to avoid redundant computation on those sufficiently\nlearned samples. Furthermore, we release a testbed based on a synthetic environment and the Atari benchmark to validate the effectiveness of any exploration algorithms under Incremental RL. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can efficiently learn the unseen transitions in new environments, leading to notable performance improvement, i.e., an average of more than 80%, over eight baselines examined.",

        "abstract": " Despite the multiple applications of the oregano ( Plectranthus amboinicus (Lour)), an important herbaceous plant because of its medicinal and culinary properties, limited research has been conducted on this species’ solar drying. Thus, the experimental drying of oregano leaves in a tropical climate was performed using direct and indirect solar drying and an electric oven in this research work. Also, mathematical modeling of the drying process, moisture diffusivity, activation energy, and colorimetric analysis (as a quality parameter) were accomplished to complement the experimental evaluation and understand the drying process behavior. The results show a shorter drying time obtained with the electric oven with 210 min reached at 65°C; however, the minimum solar drying time (250 min) was achieved with a maximum drying rate of 0.025 g water/g dry matter per minute and minimum final moisture between 0.28 and 0.13 g water/g dry matter was obtained with indirect solar dryer. Moreover, the models that better represented the experimental data were Modified Page, Page, and Logarithmic, with a maximum value of R2 obtained of 0.9980 corresponding to the Logarithmic model. Furthermore, a maximum effective diffusivity value of 1.81E-9 was obtained with direct solar dryer natural convection, while for the electric oven, were 1.14E-10, 2.280E-10, and 1.026E-09 for 45, 55, and 65°C, respectively. The activation energy for water diffusion in oregano leaves was 55.66 and 97.78 kJ/g mol for solar dryers and electric ovens, respectively, which were values very close to those reported in the literature. Finally, the colorimetric analysis exhibited a minimum color change value of 17.1 obtained for the indirect solar dryer, allowing better oregano preservation and maintaining its quality for the market, which makes it ideal for drying oregano in tropical climates and promotes solar drying use for sustainable growth of the region.

        "abstract": " Traditional machine learning methods are difficult to accurately forecast oil production when development measures change. A method of oil reservoir production prediction based on normalized mutual information and a long short-term memory-based sequence-to-sequence model (Seq2Seq-LSTM) was proposed to forecast reservoir production considering the influence of liquid production and well spacing density. First, the marine sandstone reservoirs in the Y basin were taken as the research object to establish the sample database. Then, the feature selection was carried out according to the normalized mutual information, and liquid production, production time, equivalent well spacing density, fluidity and original formation pressure were determined as input features. Finally, a Seq2Seq-LSTM model was established to forecast reservoir production by learning the interaction from multiple samples and multiple sequences, and mining the relationship between oil production and features. The research showed that the model has a high accuracy of production prediction and can forecast the change of production when the liquid production and well spacing density change, which can provide scientific recommendations to help the oilfield develop and adjust efficiently.

        "abstract": " Liquid nitrogen has emerged as a promising fracturing medium for unconventional natural gas extraction, particularly in the context of coalbed methane extraction, generating significant interest in recent times. In this paper, we analyze the acoustic emission (AE) characteristics of coal samples treated with liquid nitrogen under three-point bending load conditions using indoor experiments and field investigations. We investigate the impact of liquid nitrogen on coal samples by analyzing AE data. The mechanical properties of coal samples with varying initial temperatures were tested under three-point bending load conditions after treatment with liquid nitrogen. The load-displacement curve was analyzed to study the mechanical properties of the coal samples after treatment with liquid nitrogen. Through indoor three-point bending experiments, data analysis, and knowledge of mechanics, we systematically investigated the changes in mechanical properties caused by liquid nitrogen treatment under different conditions. The results demonstrate that the application of liquid nitrogen has significant impacts on the mechanical and AE characteristics of coal samples. The load-displacement curve indicated that the mechanical properties of the coal samples changed after treatment with liquid nitrogen. The AE experiment revealed regular changes in vibration and energy parameters of coal samples after liquid nitrogen treatment under different conditions. We further investigated the changes in mechanical properties and deformation characteristics of coal samples after undergoing liquid nitrogen freezing and thawing in differing environments. Graphs such as load-displacement curves, load-time curves, cumulative vibration count-energy count graphs, and RA-AF density distribution diagrams visually demonstrated the changes in mechanical properties and deformation characteristics. Through an integrated approach of indoor experiments, data analysis, and knowledge of mechanics, our study provides a better understanding of the behavior of coal samples under different conditions. This understanding can contribute to the development of safer and more efficient methods for extracting coalbed methane. ",

Reinforcement learning interacts with its environment and observes the consequences of its actions in response to rewards or punishments received. Reinforcement Learning uses information from every interaction with its environment to update its knowledge. The problem identified from this research is the lack of consistency, which is not always the same for Non-Player Characters (Agents) in the process of exploring an environment (Game environment). This research uses the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Waterfall model method to train Non Player Characters (Agents) in the Amc Dash Mark I Game which uses the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm in several stages. Training results show improvements in model performance over time. The average duration of the episode and average reward episode showed an increase of 7.75 to 24.7, while the exploration rate decreased to 0.05. This indicates that the model has experienced learning and is improving to achieve better rewards by performing fewer actions. The lower loss also shows that the model has succeeded in reducing prediction errors and improving prediction capabilities.",

By integrating scanning electron microscopy, low-temperature CO2 and N2 adsorption, high-pressure mercury intrusion, and nuclear magnetic resonance with centrifugation at different speeds, the pore system and pore fluid distribution of Da’anzhai Member lacustrine shale in the Sichuan Basin are studied. The results show that: (1) The reservoir space is mainly inorganic pores and micro-fractures. Nano-micron scale pores are commonly found and widely distributed in the Da’anzhai shale with multiple peaks of 28 nm, 200 nm, 900 nm, and 3.5 µm. The total pore volume ranges from 0.00849 to 0.02808 cm³/g, and the pores ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm are the main contributors to total pore volume. (2) Pore fluid can be divided into movable oil, bound oil, and adsorption oil. The proportion of movable oil, bound oil, and adsorbed oil is 21.4%, 12.4%, and 66.2% in Da’anzhai shale, respectively. Movable oil mainly occurs in pores larger than 350 nm, bound oil is 30–350 nm, while adsorbed oil mainly exists in pores below 30 nm. (3) The higher the total organic carbon content and clay minerals content, the smaller the pore size, resulting in the low content of movable oil. The higher the content of brittle minerals such as quartz, the better the development of intergranular pores and microfractures, and the higher the content of movable oil. Through the grading evaluation of shale pore structure and pore fluid, it is conducive to guide the exploration and development of Da’anzhai shale oil, which has important theoretical and practical significance.

By combining theory and field practice, a flexible formwork concrete wall + anchor cable joint support scheme is proposed to strengthen small coal pillars. Further, the design scheme for the aforementioned framework at the bottom of the layered mining region of an extra-thick coal seam is proposed. Then, field tests are carried out, and the surrounding rock activity law of the double flexible formwork wall entry retention in a layered mining coal seam is obtained. The results show that (i) 010202 the whole process of overburden collapse to stability at the stratified mining face is completed 60--200 m behind the face and (ii) the roadway deformation of the extra-thick coal seam in the Baijigou Coal mine can be divided into four stages, and the mining pressure of the gas drainage roadway basically presents a dynamic change of “pressurized stage – peak stage – stabilized pressure stage”. Based on this, three mechanical stages of roadway deformation are derived: (1) δz< Nmz<< Nwz; (2) Nmz < δz << Nwz; and (3) Nmz < δz< Nwz. Three repeated mining support optimization schemes are provided, one for each stage. Finally, the deformation and damage of the surrounding rock are effectively controlled, and the requirement that the gas drainage roadway is still intact under the influence of the 010203 working face mining is realized. This study has certain reference significance for gob-side entry retention in the bottom layer of stratified mining in extra-thick coal seams. ",

The stevia plant is a great natural substitute. It provides no calories and has medicinal properties such as oral antibacterial, hypoglycemic, and anti-hypertensive with a high nutritional value. In this work, the effects of temperature and air velocity in drying kinetics of stevia leaves were studied using a convective drier operating with air velocities (2, 3, and 4 m/s) and temperatures controlled (45 °C, 55 °C, and 65 °C). The highest drying rate was obtained at 65 °C and 4 m/s air velocity at 0.05 kg water/kg dry matter min. The experimental data were fitted to theoretical drying models to determine the best approach. It is found that the Page model gives a good fit for all experiments, with correlation coefficients ( R2) > 0.9994. The equations to correlate this model's variables with air and temperature were determined. The results show that Δ E and glucoside values increase when temperature and air velocity increase. ",

        "abstract": " The Middle Jurassic Walloon Subgroup of Daandine gas field contains numerous coal seams with abundant coalbed methane (CBM) resources. However, the vertical gas content distribution of these coal seams is unclear currently, as well as its influencing factors, affecting the formulation of CBM exploration and exploitation strategy. For this purpose, using diverse geologic, experimental, and engineering data from recent exploration and development, this article ascertains the vertical coalbed gas content distribution in the Daandine gas field and discusses how the geological factors affect it. The results show that the coalbed gas contents have two basic trends as the depth increases: (1) increase, and then decrease; (2) increase. The former trend is dominant, and the inflection point occurs in the coal groups within or close to the Tangalooma Sandstone Formation. The correlation analysis shows that the macerals have little influence on the vertical coalbed gas content distribution. The moisture contents affect the adsorption capacity of coalbeds and show a negative correlation with the gas contents, and coal groups with higher moisture contents generally have lower gas contents. Three sets of independent gas-bearing systems exist in the Walloon Subgroup, and the coalbed gas content-depth relationship is relatively independent among different gas-bearing systems. The better the caprock condition, the higher the gas content, which is particularly evident in the coals of Condamine group. The permeabilities show a significant effect on the coalbed gas contents of Daandine coals. The coal groups within or close to the Tangalooma Sandstone Formation have higher permeabilities, as well as higher gas contents, and they are positively correlated. The reason is that the CBM in the study area is dominantly microbial in origin, and the higher permeability coals are conducive to the introduction of more microbial consortia into the coal seams, enhancing the generation of secondary biogenesis methane.

        "abstract": " The Fengcheng Formation in the Hashan area of the northwestern Junggar Basin is a complex fine-grained sedimentary rock deposited in a saline-alkaline lake basin and influenced by mechanical, volcanic, chemical, and biological processes. The Fengcheng Formation, influenced by synsedimentary volcanism, has a complex mineral composition, abundant organic matter, and frequent sedimentary structure. As a result, the commonly used lithofacies classification scheme based on rock composition and grain size is difficult to characterize accurately, hampering the evaluation of the Fengcheng Formation's hydrocarbon exploration potential. Therefore, the shale lithofacies classification scheme of Fengcheng Formation was proposed. This scheme classifies the Fengcheng Formation shales into four categories and eight sub-categories based on terrigenous clasts, carbonate minerals, and volcanic clasts, as well as organic matter content and sedimentary structure. Furthermore, this scheme considers the organic and tuffaceous matter, which is essential for evaluating hydrocarbon generation properties, reservoir properties, and the brittleness of fine-grained sedimentary rocks.

        "abstract": " The coarse-grained glutenite rock mass of the proximal fan delta is characterized by the blocky texture, mixing of gravels with varied sizes, high mud content, and low porosity and permeability, leading to difficulties in assessment and exploration of oil and gas enrichment regularities of tight glutenite. The Permian Xiazijie Formation in the northwest margin of Junggar Basin has a set of tight glutenite reservoirs, and the reservoir quality is an important controlling factor for oil and gas enrichment. Based on three-dimensional earthquake, casting thin sections, rock physical property, geochemistry, the sedimentary facies division, petrologic features, physical property regularities, pore types and diagenesis of Xiazijie Formation were analyzed. This research develops the pore evolution model of the coarse-grained deposition via the quantitative analysis of porosity evolution. First, during the rapid compaction, intensive mechanical compaction results in reduction of the original porosity from 29.8% to 15.1%. Secondly, the cement formed during the eodiagenesis destructs the reservoir space and leads to an average porosity loss of 6.5%. Third, dissolution effectively improves reservoir quality. It mainly dissolves the zeolite cement, and the porosity grows to 12.1% from 8.6%. The dissolution occurs during the main hydrocarbon expulsion stage of the source rock, which is in favor of hydrocarbon emplacement. Fourth, during the telodiagenesis with the deepening burial and intensifying pressure solution, siliceous and carbonate cement precipitate, the reservoir physical property is degraded again, the porosity loss is about 3.4%. After a series of complex diagenetic processes, the current tight glutenite reservoir comes into being, with the porosity of about 8.7%. The research results provide theoretical reference for coarse-grained glutenite reservoir prediction. ",

        "abstract": " One of the main sources of crude oil and product losses in refineries is the storage tanks. The lightest hydrocarbons in these tanks evaporate during operation, causing not only a loss of the precious raw hydrocarbon material but also a source of dangerous gas pollution. For calculating these losses, several direct and indirect approaches have been devised. In this study, we used a method based on the comparison of the differences in the characteristics of crude oil or other products. This work aimed to find the specifications of two products, kerosene and gas oil, and calculate the losses that occur for the quantities in the dispatch warehouse in the NRC. Four samples of kerosene were used and named: kero@02-1, kero@05-2, kero@10-3, and kero@11-4, while four samples of gas oil were named: gaso@02-1, gaso@05-2, gaso@10-3, and gaso@11-4. Also, they depend on the date of certificate issue, respectively. The received quantities were calculated in ml and converted to cubic meters using the tank coefficient (kerosene tank coefficient 0.638 and gas oil tank coefficient 0.408). Calculations were made of 1500 ml for kerosene and 2500 ml for gas oil. In addition, this project dealt with a simplified method of work that includes the physical properties to find the actual quantities that are lost for the mentioned petroleum products. Moreover, the highest losses were for kerosene (5 m3) at sp. gr 0.750, and the highest losses were for gas oil (5 m3) at sp. gr 0.820. The results showed that there is a quantity of fluctuating losses that does not exceed 5 m3 / 1000 m3 and that these losses are in accordance with the permissible limits. The results recommend directing the laboratory tester's teams in the NRC Baiji to conduct periodic examinations of the petroleum products, as well as not to collusion when receiving a low product with laboratory examination specifications to reduce losses in quantities.

        "abstract": "Cultures around the world show varying levels of conservatism. While maintaining traditional ideas prevents wrong ones from being embraced, it also slows or prevents adaptation to new times. Without exploration there can be no improvement, but often this effort is wasted as it fails to produce better results, making it better to exploit the best known option. This tension is known as the exploration/exploitation issue, and it occurs at the individual and group levels, whenever decisions are made. As such, it is has been investigated across many disciplines. We extend previous work by approximating a continuum of traits under local exploration, employing the method of adaptive dynamics, and studying multiple fitness functions. In this work, we ask how nature would solve the exploration/exploitation issue, by allowing natural selection to operate on an exploration parameter in a variety of contexts, thinking of exploration as mutation in a trait space with a varying fitness function. Specifically, we study how exploration rates evolve by applying adaptive dynamics to the replicator-mutator equation, under two types of fitness functions. For the first, payoffs are accrued from playing a two-player, two-action symmetric game, we consider representatives of all games in this class, including the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Hawk-Dove, and Stag Hunt games, finding exploration rates often evolve downwards, but can also undergo neutral selection as well depending on the games parameters or initial conditions. Second, we study time dependent fitness with a function having a single oscillating peak. By increasing the period, we see a jump in the optimal exploration rate, which then decreases towards zero as the frequency of environmental change increases. These results establish several possible evolutionary scenarios for exploration rates, providing insight into many applications, including why we can see such diversity in rates of cultural change.",

        "abstract": " Karst is widely researched in the field of carbonate reservoirs. This study proposes a new formation mechanism and development model, specifically epigenetic karst, and asserts that high-quality reservoirs can be developed in the karst highlands and karst slopes of ancient landforms under the epigenetic karst with facies-controlled characteristics. The results indicate that there are three stages of karst in the study area. The first period is syngenetic karst, characterized by molds, intragranular dissolution pores, and micritization. Isotopic data reveal that the range of variation of carbonate rock 13C and 18O is similar to that of cement. The second period is epigenetic karst, the most significant karst in the study area. It undergoes a prolonged development time and features non-selective fabric dissolution. Oxygen and carbon isotopes exhibit negative values (18O ranges from −10.033‰ to −13.767‰ and 13C ranges from −2.56‰ to −0.52‰), which are significantly altered by atmospheric precipitation. The third period is buried karst, characterized by suture structure and asphaltene filling. The negative value of 18O in calcite veins is significantly <−15‰. The dissolved pores and caves formed by the epigenetic karst become the primary reservoir space for oil and gas in carbonate rocks. These exhibit facies-control characteristics, indicating that bioclastic limestone karst is well-developed and micritic limestone karst is underdeveloped. The study establishes a development model for karst reservoirs in the study area, selecting the highlands and slopes of ancient landforms as favorable exploration sites. ",

        "abstract": " As human demand for energy continues to grow, energy security has become an important research topic for national economic and social development. As the country with the highest energy demand and import in the world, China needs to ensure its energy import security in a personal way. Against this research background, this paper investigates the causal relationship between bilateral political relations and China's energy import security. This research selected HS 6-digit percentile trade data from 47 energy-exporting countries engaged in energy trade with China from 2000 to 2020. A trade gravity model was constructed to examine the impact of bilateral political relations on China's energy import security. Multiple empirical analyses were conducted using the PPMLHDFE method to investigate various aspects of the relationship. The research shows that: (1) Bilateral political relations can significantly affect China's energy trade imports. (2) The regional security situation of exporting countries and the signing of free trade agreements with China play a moderating role between bilateral political relations and energy imports. (3) In the heterogeneity analysis, the influence of bilateral political relations on China's energy trade has obvious stage characteristics, and the influence of bilateral political relations on China's energy trade is stronger in countries and regions along the Belt and Road Initiative, and there is a certain path-dependent type of China's energy imports.

        "abstract": " In Bangladesh, there are roughly 31 marine passenger ships that are in operation. These ships might be a good location for solar photovoltaic (PV) plants since solar energy is the best renewable energy to replace the fossil fuel used in the ships. A “tower rounded flower-shaped solar PV” system of PV panel arrangement—just looks like a “sunflower,” is proposed in this research. To harness maximum power, solar towers are designed in such a way that they may be freely rotated on their vertical axes and that the tilt angles of their solar panels can be adjusted from 0° to 50° on their horizontal axes freely. The “tower rounded flower-shaped solar PV” architecture of the PV array atop a maritime vessel is presented in this research along with a unique method for calculating the PV system's anticipated energy production. Finally calculated the realistic CO2 emission reduction by using this approach for a sustainable future. Applying globalsolaratlas (for horizon and sun's path estimation); PVsyst 7.2, HOMER Pro, and NREL's PVWatt calculator (for solar radiation calculation); vesselfinder (for the number of vessels analysis); shiptraffic (for vessels path analysis), this research suggests that marine passenger vessels are one of the best places to construct a proposed “tower rounded flower-shaped solar PV” power plant. According to estimates, 17 passenger ships can produce roughly 1240 MW of electricity per year and may save approximately 325.56 tons of CO2 gas emissions annually to the environment per year as compared to using fossil fuel-based power plants to produce electricity.

The results of the study show that: (1) the overall total factor productivity of the banking industry in mainland China from 2015 to 2021 is greater than 1 and shows a fluctuating upward trend except for 2015, with the mean value greater than 1 indicating a steady increase in the green credit operating efficiency of the banking industry; (2) Further analysis shows that the average value of the technical efficiency change index is greater than the average value of the technological progress index, which can be understood as the important reason for the rising operational performance of green credit business in the banking industry, and technological progress also provides a supporting role for the rising operational performance; (3) the average value of the scale efficiency change index from 2015 to 2021 is less than 1, and from 2017 onwards the value starts to be less than 1 and declining, it can be concluded that scale efficiency hinders the increase of technical efficiency index. (4) The magnitude of change in total factor productivity and the influencing factors of the 10 banks are all related to technical efficiency, indicating that the improvement of technical efficiency is the dominant factor in the improvement of green credit operational efficiency; (5) the pure technical efficiency of all 10 banks keeps increasing while the scale efficiency is decreasing, indicating that pure technical efficiency is the key factor in the improvement of banks’ technical progress index, while scale efficiency inhibits the further improvement of technical progress index. The increase in the technical progress index has been inhibited by scale efficiency. ",

Therefore, experiments have been conducted in the climate conditions of Tamil Nadu (77.07° E,11.04° N), India, from April 15, 2019, to May 20, 2019. The objective of the work is to explore the effect of a tilting angle on the performance of an evacuated tube solar collector with a thermosyphon attached to the compound parabolic concentrator. The CPC is designed with an aperture width of 343 mm, concentration ratio of 2.32, and aperture angle of 25.4°, improving the solar collector efficiency with the help of MATLAB Programming, which gets Coordinate points based on these coordinate points. CPC Profile is fabricated. The Thermosyphon heat pipe is constructed with a Copper tube having a 19 mm diameter with 40% Acetone charged. The experiments were conducted by varying the tilting angles of the solar collector at 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60° horizontal. The heat resistance and instantaneous efficiency of the solar collector are studied in this study. The result reveals a minimum thermal resistance of 0.02 kW−1, and a maximum efficiency of 78% was recorded at a 45° tilting angle. ",

The method is represented by a multi-objective arithmetic optimization and cuckoo search with multi-criteria decision-making approach. The proposed model generates first a number of I–V curves as candidates. This phase is conducted through multi-objective optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm is assessed by a non-dominated ranking scheme and crowding distance framework. After that, the best I–V curve candidate is chosen from the result of Pareto front by using the VIKOR multi-criteria decision-making method. Moreover, the analytic hierarchy approach is employed to select the appropriate weight for each criterion. The proposed method is validated by using an experimental data under various operational conditions. This validation is done by extracting different I–V characteristic for PV modules. The proposed method is compared to a number of methods in the literature. Results show that the proposed method exceeds other methods in the literature considering the accuracy of generating the I–V curves. In addition, results show that the proposed method requires less computational power as compared to other hybridized methods. ",

The Linyi geothermal field, located in the southern section of the Yishu fault in Shandong Province, boasts abundant geothermal resources. However, its origin is still unclear. This study analyzed the characteristics of terrestrial heat flow using the temperature logging of geothermal wells and measurements of thermal conductivity and heat production. Combined with the geophysical information of the Xiangshui (Jiangsu Province)-Mandula (Nei Mongol) geoscience transect and the lithology revealed by the geothermal wells, this study built a conceptual model of the lithospheric thermal structure using the one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction equation. Based on this model, the heat flow is 64.9 mW/m2, indicating a high geothermal setting in the study area. Furthermore, the ratio of crustal to mantle heat flow is < 1 (0.67), implying that surface heat flow originates predominantly from the mantle. The Yishu fault probably acts as a pathway for heat transfer from the mantle. The temperature of the Moho boundary in the study area was estimated to be 614.8 °C. The Curie depth was calculated to be 29.5 km (585 °C), which is consistent with the depth estimated using the aeromagnetic data. In sum, the Linyi geothermal field has a high geothermal setting, which contributes to the formation of geothermal resources. ",

        "abstract": " Energy consumption is one of the most important variables that have an impact on the environment. One of the nations in the world with the highest per capita electrical energy usage is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Many attempts are being made in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to lower energy consumption and electricity consumption to achieve sustainability. In this work, the data on the energy consumption of two mosques in Hail City were analyzed, and the opportunities for energy conservation and the use of solar energy were studied to make mosques sustainable. Annual energy use intensity was determined to be 100 and 121 kWh/m2 for the Al-Khashil and Al-Jamil mosques, respectively. While Al-Khashil's mosque envelope is insulated, energy efficiency measures implemented to the walls, roof, and windows of Al-Jamil's mosque resulted in reductions in energy consumption of 27%, 13%, and 6%, respectively. The most effective energy efficiency option is a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system with a high energy efficiency ratio, which can reduce cooling demand by more than 30%. If the condition of Saudi Building Code 601 is met, then it has the potential to cut energy usage by 35.4% and 63.3% for Al-Khashil and Al-Jamil, respectively. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, Al-Khashil's electricity usage was reduced by 58,737 kWh, or 39.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. When using data from RETScreen and ATLAS, there were inconsistencies of up to 28%, but for DesignBuilder, the findings were the closest to the billing data. The mosques Al-Khashil and Al-Jamil have a combined yearly photovoltaic energy output from the suggested systems of around 135.93 MWh and 33.98 MWh, respectively. For the mosques, Al-Khashil and Al-Jamil, the yearly yield factor and capacity factor were both 1887.9 kWh/kWp/year and 21.9%, respectively. The annual greenhouse gas emission reductions from photovoltaic systems for Al-Khashil and Al-Jamil were 102.9 tCO2 and 25.72 tCO2, respectively. Concerning economics, the following results were obtained: The levelized cost of energy of photovoltaic systems is 0.0901 SR/kWh (0.024 $/kWh); the net present value and internal rate of return for photovoltaic systems are not suitable as a result of the current prices and the system applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If the electricity produced from photovoltaic systems is injected into the grid at a rate of 0.32 SR/kWh, which is comparable to the SEC tariff for the mosque or government sector, then the simple payback time is 5.14 years.

        "abstract": "Controller synthesis is in essence a case of model-based planning for non-deterministic environments in which plans (actually “strategies”) are meant to preserve system goals indefinitely. In the case of supervisory control environments are specified as the parallel composition of state machines and valid strategies are required to be “non-blocking” (i.e., always enabling the environment to reach certain marked states) in addition to safe (i.e., keep the system within a safe zone). Recently, On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis techniques were proposed to avoid the exploration of the entire -and exponentially large- environment space, at the cost of non-maximal permissiveness, to either find a strategy or conclude that there is none. The incremental exploration of the plant is currently guided by a domain-independent human-designed heuristic.\nIn this work, we propose a new method for obtaining heuristics based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The synthesis algorithm is thus framed as an RL task with an unbounded action space and a modified version of DQN is used. With a simple and general set of features that abstracts both states and actions, we show that it is possible to learn heuristics on small versions of a problem that generalize to the larger instances, effectively doing zero-shot policy transfer. Our agents learn from scratch in a highly partially observable RL task and outperform the existing heuristic overall, in instances unseen during training.",

However, modern engineering often entails the use of computationally intensive simulation, which can lead to slower design timelines with highly iterative approaches such as reinforcement learning. This work provides a reinforcement learning framework that leverages models of varying fidelity to enable an effective solution search while reducing overall computational needs. Specifically, it utilizes models of varying fidelity while training the agent, iteratively progressing from low- to high fidelity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we apply it to two multimodal multi-objective constrained mixed integer nonlinear design problems involving the components of a ground and aerial vehicle. Specifically, for each problem, we utilize a high-fidelity and a low-fidelity deep neural network surrogate model, trained on performance data generated from underlying ground truth models. A tradeoff between solution quality and the proportion of low-fidelity surrogate model usage is observed. Specifically, high-quality solutions are achieved with substantial reductions in computational expense, showcasing the effectiveness of the framework for design problems where the use of just a high-fidelity model is infeasible. This solution quality-computational efficiency tradeoff is contextualized by visualizing the exploration behavior of the design agents.",

        "abstract": "It is known that animals foraging in the wild must balance their levels of exploitation and exploration so as to maximize resource consumption. This usually manifests as an area-restricted search strategy, such that animals tend to exploit environmental patches and make long excursions between patches. This optimal foraging strategy, however, relies on an underlying assumption: nearby locations yield similar resources. Here, we offer an explanation as to how animals utilize this assumption, which implicitly involves generalization. We also describe the computational mechanisms hypothesized to incorporate factors of exploitation, exploration, and generalization, thus, providing a more holistic picture of animal search strategies. Moreover, we connect this foraging behavior to cognition in general. As such, we suggest that cognitive processes, particularly those involved in sequential decision-making, reuse the computational principles grafted into neural activity by the evolution of optimal foraging. We speculate as to what neurobiological substrates may be using area-restricted search, as well as how a model of exploitation, exploration, and generalization can inform psychopathology.",

        "abstract": " The Triassic top unconformity in the Ordos Basin, which serves as a transfer station for hydrocarbon migration, has become a bottleneck for Mesozoic oil and gas exploration. Taking the Sanbian area as an example, based on core observations, petrophysical properties, and a weathering index analysis of five coring wells, a standard for the quantitative identification of the vertical structure of the unconformity is established using the optimal segmentation method and principal component analysis of conventional logging curves. The standard is then applied to 40 real wells, and 32 typical unconformity reservoirs are dissected. The results show that the reclassification of the unconformity surface corrects the 17.5% error in the geological stratification as an unconformity. On this basis, a quantitative identification standard for the structure of the unconformity is established via the principal component curve. The analysis of unconformity structure types applied to five paleogeomorphic units reveals that the slope mouth and slope develop three layers of structure, namely residual layer, weathered clay layer, and weathered leaching zone, while highlands, river valleys, and inter-river hills lack weathered clay layer. As an independent oil and gas-bearing layer, the unconformity has two types of reservoir-forming models. The first is the hydrocarbon accumulation in the Chang1–Chang2 member shielded by weathered clay layer in the slope mouth and slope. The second is hydrocarbon migrated from the residual layer to the local structural high part of the Yan 10–Yan 9 member in the slope mouth. The hydrocarbon in the unconformity is complementary to the upper Yan 10–Yan 9 member and the lower unweathered rock layer of Yanchang Formation. The results of this study are of great significance to the quantitative identification of unconformity structures in exploration wells without coring data in the study area, as well as to future hydrocarbon exploration in the Mesozoic strata.

Observation description and sampling analysis of cores, the grain size analysis, casting thin section, scanning electron microscope, mercury pressure, nuclear magnetic resonance, and conventional physical analysis are used to clarify the main controlling factors and oil-bearing potential characteristics of the Chang 8 reservoir in southwest Ordos Basin. The results show that delta front subfacies are mainly developed in Chang 8 member, including distributary channel, natural dike, estuary bar and distributary bay. The main rock type of reservoir is lithic feldspathic sandstone, followed by feldspathic lithic sandstone. The types of reservoir space are mainly intergranular pores and intragranular dissolved pores, with a small amount of clay-related pores and micro-fractures. The average porosity and permeability of the reservoir are 11.67% and 0.52 × 10−3μm2, respectively. The reservoirs with high oil saturation are mainly distributary channels and thicker mouth bar sand bodies. Compaction is the main factor of reservoir compaction (porosity loss rate is 55.73%), followed by cementation (porosity loss rate is 29.23%). The favorable diagenesis is the dissolution of feldspar grains and some cement. The Chang 8 tight reservoir contains various nano-scale pore-throat. For tight reservoirs with similar physical properties, the pore-throat structure controls the oil saturation of the tight reservoir. Favorable conditions for tight sandstone reservoirs oil saturation include favorable sedimentary environment (distributary channel or thick mouth bar) and suitable microscopic pore characteristics.

        "abstract": " Sodium in the coals of West China has received persistent attention due to its high contents and severe pollutions’ problems during coal utilization. A total of seven drill samples of the Jurassic coals from Tatuo coalfield, Qinghai Province, were collected and analysed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray powder diffraction, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The results indicate that the Tatuo coal is of lower-high ash, medium volatile matter and ultra-low sulphur bituminous coal. Tatuo coal contains much more Na2O (> 2%), and belongs to high-sodium coal. The maceral index and element ratios of Sr/Cu, Fe/Mn and Sr/Ba showed that Tatuo coal was formed in a terrestrial peat swamp environment. The minerals in Tatuo coal, including clay minerals and halite, quartz, gypsum and rutile, are mainly concentrated in the bottom and top parts of the coal seam. Combined with scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry and optical microscope characteristics, the sodium could be carried into the peat/coal after the peat formation by basin fluids. The East Kunlun orogenic belt may be the main source of these minerals. ",

        "abstract": " Shallow-water carbonates from the Yingshan Formation are important target of hydrocarbon exploration in Tarim Basin. Detailed descriptions of outcrop, core, and thin sections, isotopic composition analysis, and trace element analysis were conducted. Seven lithofacies which consists of two facies belt groups were identified and used to interpret deposition environments of Yingshan Formation: (1) peritidal carbonate, with relatively lower δ13C values from −4.2% to −1.9%, mainly represented by intertidal to supratidal facies and restricted subtidal facies and (2) open-marine subtidal carbonate, with higher δ13C values (−1.5% to −0.3%), mainly consists of shoal facies and interbank sea facies. On the basis of the lithology sets, four types of meter-scale cycle model (types A–D) were grouped into peritidal sequences and subtidal sequences. On the basis of vertical lithofacies, cycle stacking patterns, and accommodation variations in Fischer plots, two third-order depositional sequences (SQ1–SQ2) were recognized. The sequence boundary between SQ1 and SQ2 is not only a surface of a positive shift of δ13C values, but also the transitional zone of cycle stacking patterns. The sequences can be further divided into four fourth-order sequence sets: Sq1–Sq4. The lower sequences (Sq1–Sq2) are dominated by peritidal facies and characterized by a progressive decreasing in accommodation space probably indicates a longer-term fall in sea level. The upper sequences (Sq3–Sq4) are mainly dominated by subtidal facies and characterized by the accommodation space with a progressive increasement, likely indicates a rising sea level with a longer term. The facies-controlled reservoirs are mainly present in the Sq3, related to the sequence boundary between SQ1 and SQ2. ",

        "abstract": " Mine water disaster is closely related to the geological structure of the mine. A scientific evaluation of the complexity of the minefield structure can greatly contribute to mining safety. In this study, we optimized the fault impact index in the study area and proposed an improved local linear embedding (LLE) algorithm by investigating the Shengquan coal mine. We analyzed the fault formation age and connectivity between faults in the study area, combined with topology theory, and based on previous studies. The mechanical properties of faults and the influence of small faults on the strata can be combined to derive a quantitative evaluation model of the structural complexity of mines. Based on the evaluation model, the study area was divided into a simple structural area, a medium structural area, and a complex structural area. By comparing the location of water inrush points in recent years with the three-dimensional high-density electrical exploration of the 21,304 working face, the effectiveness and rationality of structural complexity zoning were determined.

        "abstract": " The conglomeratic reservoirs of the Permian Wutonggou Formation in the Yingyeer area of the Turpan–Hami Basin are key petroliferous horizons, with enormous potential for hydrocarbon exploration. Existing studies on the conglomeratic reservoirs in this area mainly focus on the sedimentary environment and sand body distribution, while few of them concern the diagenesis and evolution of the conglomeratic reservoirs, leading to deficient knowledge about relevant mechanisms. By comprehensively utilizing the data from ordinary and casting thin section identification, the x-ray diffraction analysis of whole rock and clay, scanning electron microscopy, and other analyses and assays, this study analyzed and investigated the petrological characteristics, diagenetic types, and characteristics, and diagenetic evolutionary stages and mechanisms of the conglomeratic reservoirs of the Permian Wutonggou Formation in the Yingyeer area. The study results are as follows. Under the influence of sedimentary provenances, tectonic evolution, and paleogeomorphology, the conglomeratic reservoirs of the Permian Wutonggou formation have low clastic grain maturity and low structural maturity, suggesting proximal provenances. The reservoirs are subjected to various diagenesis, including carbonate cementation, which fills pores and throats; compaction as a major factor leading to poor reservoir quality, and dissolution, which significantly improves the reservoir properties. The conglomeratic reservoirs in the Wutonggou formation are generally in substage A of the middle diagenetic stage. The diagenetic evolution of the reservoirs generally underwent early mechanical compaction, calcite precipitation, secondary quartz overgrowth, the injection of organic fluids, the dissolution of feldspars and lithic grains, the transformation of clay minerals, and calcite cementation in sequence. Hydrocarbon charging mainly occurred during the late Middle Jurassic and was greatly influenced by early compaction and dissolution. ",

        "abstract": " In 2022, Malaysia was ranked 28th worldwide in terms of its energy oil consumption. Energy consumption in Malaysia has been predominantly reliant on natural gas and coal in both the past and present. Oil and gas in Malaysia are predicted to be depleted in 14 years due to the high energy consumption, especially from petroleum sources. Thus, the Malaysian government aims to expand renewable energy (RE) in the country's energy mix as an alternative source of energy. As of 2022, Malaysia has generated roughly 2% of its electricity from various renewable sources, which is still far from the initial target of reaching 20% RE penetration by 2030. However, since 2017, RE has started to contribute to energy mix generation. Several policies, including an act, have been implemented in Malaysia to achieve the target in RE, but many challenges and difficulties have hindered the progress. Thus, the present study explored the current status and challenges for RE in Malaysia and discussed the effectiveness of the available energy policies and programs. The outcomes are potentially valuable to Malaysian policymakers, industries and researchers to improve their current practices for achieving the initial national RE target by 2030 as well as to move forward towards net zero emissions by 2050. This study provides a crucial roadmap for Malaysia to achieve its RE objectives and contribute significantly to the international transition towards a more environmentally friendly and sustainable future.

        "abstract": " The small-scale roadway model is often used in the fine simulation of mining engineering. The determination of the structure and load conditions of the model has an important influence on the accuracy of the simulation. In this paper, a large-scale stratum model and a small-scale roadway model are established by using finite element method. The optimal loading mode of the roadway model and its applicability under different roof-sidewall stiffness ratios are studied. The simulation accuracy of the roadway model is quantitatively evaluated by comparing the distribution laws of stress field and strain field with those of the stratum models. Under the same roof-sidewall stiffness ratio, the similarity between the simulation results of the roadway model and the stratum model under displacement load is much higher than that under stress load. Under the same load mode, the stress and strain similarity between the stratum model and roadway model increases with the increase of the roof-sidewall stiffness ratio. Furtherly, the simulation application of the roadway drilling pressure relief is carried out. Compared with the large-scale stratum model with small-size elements, the small-scale roadway model under displacement load also shows obvious stress transfer after drilling pressure relief, while it has faster computational efficiency. Finally, a small-scale roadway model simulation method suitable for surrounding rock disaster occurrence mechanism and control is proposed. ",

        "abstract": " This work describes a Ge-bearing mineral in the Carboniferous medium-ash, high-sulfur and low-volatile bituminous coal of the Yuzhou Coalfield, southern part of the North China Basin. Germanium (Ge) in the investigated coals ranges from 10.4 to 57.6 μg/g, with an average of 32.8 μg/g. Average concentrations of Ge in coal samples are about 16 times higher than that of world hard coals (2.4 μg/g). Ge-bearing mineral was found in the coal sample. It occurs as a vein and is closely associated with copper zinc tin sulfide, and illite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of this mineral in coal. The average chemical composition based on the electron microprobe analyses is (in wt. %): Al 23.42, Ge 32.92, O 35.24, F 7.82, total 99.39, corresponding to (Al1.97Ge0.03)2GeO4(F0.93, OH)1.93. Krieselite has the ideal chemical formula Al2GeO4(F, OH)2, and is most likely the Ge-bearing mineral found in the investigated coal sample. The appearance of Ge-bearing mineral indicates an origin later than peat deposition and also demonstrates that Ge mineralization could take place during coalification. ",
