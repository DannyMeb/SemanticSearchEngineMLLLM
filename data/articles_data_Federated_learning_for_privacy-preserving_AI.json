        "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach that allows the neural network to be trained without exposing private user data. Despite its advantages, federated learning schemes still face two critical security challenges: user privacy disclosure and Byzantine robustness. The adversary may try to infer the private data from the trained local gradients or compromise the global model update. To tackle the above challenges, we propose PPBRFL, a privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme. To resist Byzantine attacks, we design a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation method based on\r\ncosine similarity, which can guarantee the global model update and improve the model’s classification accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a reward and penalty mechanism that considers users’ behavior to mitigate the impact of Byzantine users on the global model. To protect user privacy, we utilize symmetric homomorphic encryption to encrypt the users’ trained local models, which requires low computation cost while maintaining model accuracy. We conduct the experimental assessment of the performance of PPBRFL. The experimental results show that PPBRFL maintains model classification accuracy while ensuring privacy preservation and Byzantine robustness compared to traditional federated learning scheme.",

        "abstract": "Detecting anomalies, intrusions, and security threats in the network (including Internet of Things) traffic necessitates the processing of large volumes of sensitive data, which raises concerns about privacy and security. Federated learning, a distributed machine learning approach, enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data decentralization and privacy. In a federated learning environment, instead of training and evaluating the model on a single machine, each client learns a local model with the same structure but is trained on different local datasets. These local models are then communicated to an aggregation server that employs federated averaging to aggregate them and produce an optimized global model. This approach offers significant benefits for developing efficient and effective intrusion detection system (IDS) solutions. In this research, we investigated the effectiveness of federated learning for IDSs and compared it with that of traditional deep learning models. Our findings demonstrate that federated learning, by utilizing random client selection, achieved higher accuracy and lower loss compared to deep learning, particularly in scenarios emphasizing data privacy and security. Our experiments highlight the capability of federated learning to create global models without sharing sensitive data, thereby mitigating the risks associated with data breaches or leakage. The results suggest that federated averaging in federated learning has the potential to revolutionize the development of IDS solutions, thus making them more secure, efficient, and effective.",

        "abstract": "Summary\nFederated Learning (FL) is a framework that empowers multiple clients to develop robust machine learning (ML) algorithms while safeguarding data privacy and security. This paper's primary goal is to investigate the capability of the FL framework in preserving privacy and to assess its efficacy for clients operating within the oil and gas industry. To demonstrate the practicality of this framework, we apply it to seismic denoising use cases incorporating data from clients with IID (independent & and identically distributed) and Non-IID (non-independent and non-identically distributed) or domain-shifted data distributions. The FL setup is implemented using the well-established Flower framework.\nThe experiment involves injecting noise into 3D seismic data and subsequently employing various ML algorithms to eliminate this noise. All experiments were conducted using both IID and Non-IID data, employing both traditional and FL approaches, various tests considering different types of noise, noise factors, number of 2D seismic slices, diverse models, number of clients, and aggregations strategies.\nWe tested different model aggregation strategies, such as FedAvg, FedProx, and Fedcyclic, alongside client selection strategies that consider model divergence, convergence trend similarity, and client weight analysis to improve the aggregation process. We also incorporated batch normalization into the network architecture to reduce data discrepancies among clients. The denoising process was evaluated using metrics like mean-square-error (MSE), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).\nA comparison between conventional methods and FL demonstrated that FL exhibited a reduced error rate, especially when dealing with larger datasets. Furthermore, FL harnessed the power of parallel computing, resulting in a notable 30% increase in processing speed, enhanced resource utilization, and a remarkable 99% reduction in communication costs. To sum it up, this study underscores the potential of FL in the context of seismic denoising, safeguarding data privacy, and enhancing overall performance. We addressed the associated challenges by experimenting with various approaches for client selection and aggregation within a privacy-preserving framework. Notably, among these aggregation strategies, FedCyclic stands out as it offers faster convergence, achieving performance levels comparable to FedAvg and FedProx with fewer training iterations.",

To avoid compromising patient privacy while supporting scientific analysis on massive datasets to improve patient care, it is necessary to analyse and implement Machine Learning solutions that fulfil data security and consumption demands. In this survey paper, we meticulously explain the existing works of federated learning from many perspectives to give a thorough overview and promote future research in this area.

In a federated learning setup, a\ncentral aggregator coordinates the efforts of several clients working together to solve machine learning\nissues. The privacy of each device's data is protected by this setup's decentralized training data.\nFederated learning reduces traditional centralized machine learning systems' systemic privacy issues\nand costs by emphasizing local processing and model transfer.

As a means of providing a comprehensive\nreview and encouraging further research into the topic, we introduce the works of federated learning\nfrom five different vantage points: data partitioning, privacy method, machine learning model,\ncommunication architecture, and systems heterogeneity. Then, we organize the issues plaguing federated\nlearning today and the potential avenues for a prospective study.

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has been widely used to solve existing computing problems through large-scale data mining. Conventional training of the deep learning model is performed on a central (cloud) server that is equipped with high computing power, by integrating data via high computational intensity. However, integrating raw data from multiple clients raises privacy concerns that are increasingly being focused on. In federated learning (FL), clients train deep learning models in a distributed fashion using their local data; instead of sending raw data to a central server, they send parameter values of the trained local model to a central server for integration. Because FL does not transmit raw data to the outside, it is free from privacy issues. In this paper, we perform an experimental study that explores the dynamics of the FL-based Android malicious app detection method under three data distributions across clients, i.e., (i) independent and identically distributed (IID), (ii) non-IID, (iii) non-IID and unbalanced. Our experiments demonstrate that the application of FL is feasible and efficient in detecting malicious Android apps in a distributed manner on cellular networks.",

        "abstract": "\n            Establishing how a set of learners can provide privacy-preserving federated learning in a fully decentralized (peer-to-peer, no coordinator) manner is an open problem. We propose the first privacy-preserving consensus-based algorithm for the distributed learners to achieve decentralized global model aggregation in an environment of high mobility, where participating learners and the communication graph between them may vary during the learning process. In particular, whenever the communication graph changes, the Metropolis-Hastings method [\n            69\n            ] is applied to update the weighted adjacency matrix based on the current communication topology. In addition, the Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) scheme [\n            61\n            ] is integrated to facilitate privacy in reaching consensus of the global model. The article establishes the correctness and privacy properties of the proposed algorithm. The computational efficiency is evaluated by a simulation built on a federated learning framework with a real-world dataset.\n          ",

        "abstract": "A wealth of data is constantly being collected by manufacturers from their wind turbine fleets. And yet, a lack of data access and sharing impedes exploiting the full potential of the data. Our study presents a privacy-preserving machine learning approach for fleet-wide learning of condition information without sharing any data locally stored on the wind turbines. We show that through federated fleet-wide learning, turbines with little or no representative training data can benefit from accuracy gains from improved normal behavior models. Customizing the global federated model to individual turbines yields the highest fault detection accuracy in cases where the monitored target variable is distributed heterogeneously across the fleet. We demonstrate this for bearing temperatures, a target variable whose normal behavior can vary widely depending on the turbine. We show that no member of the fleet is affected by a degradation in model accuracy by participating in the collaborative learning procedure, resulting in superior performance of the federated learning strategy in our case studies. Distributed learning increases the normal behavior model training times by about a factor of ten due to increased communication overhead and slower model convergence.",

        "abstract": "The extensive application of the Internet of Things in the industrial field has formed the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). By analyzing and training data from the industrial Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing can be realized. Due to privacy concerns, the industrial data of various institutions cannot be shared, which forms data islands. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving data aggregation federated learning (PPDAFL) scheme for the IIoT. In federated learning, data aggregation is adopted to protect model changes and provide data security for industrial devices. By utilizing a practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm, each round selects an IIoT device from each aggregation area as the data aggregation and initialization node, and uses data aggregation to protect the model changes of a single user while resisting reverse analysis attacks from the industrial management center. The Paillier cryptosystem and secret sharing are combined to realize data security, fault tolerance, and data sharing. A security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme reduces computation and communication overheads while guaranteeing data privacy, message authenticity, and integrity.",

        "abstract": "The need to protect data privacy and improve threat intelligence in the constantly changing field of cybersecurity has prompted the investigation of novel approaches. This research presents, within the scope of privacy-preserving cyber security, a decentralized method of threat intelligence using Federated Learning (FL). Sensitive threat intelligence data is maintained locally thanks to the decentralized structure of the suggested solution, which reduces the dangers associated with centralized repositories. The cornerstone is federated learning, which permits cooperative model training between dispersed entities without disclosing raw data. Differential privacy and homomorphic encryption are two privacy-preserving strategies that are combined to protect personal information while learning collaboratively. Updates to the model are safely combined and added to a global threat intelligence model without jeopardizing the privacy of the entities involved. The article delves into the nuances of this decentralized strategy, with a focus on building strong security and governance frameworks, being flexible enough to respond to new threats, and continuously improving through feedback loops. This decentralized method offers a viable model for threat intelligence in the future of cyber security by encouraging cooperation, protecting privacy, and strengthening the group's protection against cyberattacks.",

In this paper, we propose a general privacy-preserving vertical federated deep learning framework called FedPass, which leverages adaptive obfuscation to protect the feature and label simultaneously.  Strong privacy-preserving capabilities about private features and labels are theoretically proved (in Theorems 1 and 2).\n\nExtensive experimental results with different datasets and network architectures also justify the superiority of FedPass against existing methods in light of its near-optimal trade-off between privacy and model performance.",

They solve the\n            tyranny of choice\n            problem faced by many users, and are utilized by many online businesses to drive engagement and sales. Besides other criticisms, like creating filter bubbles within social networks, recommender systems are often reproved for collecting considerable amounts of personal data. However, to personalize recommendations, personal information is fundamentally required. A recent distributed learning scheme called federated learning has made it possible to learn from personal user data without its central collection. Consequently, we present a recommender system for movie recommendations, which provides privacy and thus trustworthiness on multiple levels: First and foremost, it is trained using federated learning and thus, by its very nature, privacy-preserving, while still enabling users to benefit from global insights. Furthermore, a novel federated learning scheme, called FedQ, is employed, which not only addresses the problem of non-i.i.d.-ness and small local datasets, but also prevents input data reconstruction attacks by aggregating client updates early. Finally, to reduce the communication overhead, compression is applied, which significantly compresses the exchanged neural network parametrizations to a fraction of their original size. We conjecture that this may also improve data privacy through its lossy quantization stage.\n          ",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe concept of Autonomous Taxis (ATs) has witnessed a remarkable surge in popularity in recent years, paving the way toward future smart cities. However, accurately forecasting passenger demand for ATs remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches for passenger demand forecasting often rely on centralized data collection and analysis, which can raise privacy concerns and incur high communication costs. To address these challenges, We propose a collaborative model using Federated Learning (FL) for passenger demand forecasting in smart city transportation systems. Our proposed approach enables ATs in different regions of the smart city to collaboratively learn and improve their demand forecasting models through FL while preserving the privacy of passenger data. We use several backpropagation neural networks as local models for collaborating to train the global model without directly sharing their data. The local model shares only the model updates with a global model that aggregates them, which is then sent back to local models to improve them. Our collaborative approach reduces privacy concerns and communication costs by facilitating learning from each other’s data without direct data sharing. We evaluate our approach using a real-world dataset of over 4500 taxis in Bangkok, Thailand. By utilizing MATLAB2022b, the proposed approach is compared with popular baseline methods and existing research on taxi demand forecasting systems. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms in passenger demand forecasting, surpassing existing methods in terms of model accuracy, privacy preservation, and performance metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared ($$R^2$$\n\nR\n2\n\n). Furthermore, our approach exhibits improved performance over time through the collaborative learning process as more data becomes available.",

        "abstract": "In recent decades, network security for organizations and individuals has become more and more important, and intrusion detection systems play a key role in protecting network security. To improve intrusion detection effect, different machine learning techniques have been widely applied and achieved exciting results. However, the premise that these methods achieve reliable results is that there are enough available and well-labeled training data, training and test data being from the same distribution. In real life, the limited label data generated by a single organization is not enough to train a reliable learning model, and the distribution of data collected by different organizations is difficult to be the same. In addition, various organizations protect their privacy and data security through data islands. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient intrusion detection method using transfer learning and support vector machine with privacy-preserving (FETLSVMP). FETLSVMP performs aggregation of data distributed in various organizations through federated learning, then utilizes transfer learning and support vector machines build personalized models for each organization. Specifically, FETLSVMP first builds a transfer support vector machine model to solve the problem of data distribution differences among various organizations; then, under the mechanism of federated learning, the model is used for learning without sharing training data on each organization to protect data privacy; finally, the intrusion detection model is obtained with protecting the privacy of data. Experiments are carried out on NSL-KDD, KDD CUP99 and ISCX2012, the experimental results verify that the proposed method can achieve better results of detection and robust performance, especially for small samples and emerging intrusion behaviors, and have the ability to protect data privacy.",

In the context of Federated Learning, this paper investigates the implementation of PPML for healthcare data sharing, focusing on the dynamic nature of data collection, sample sizes, data modalities, patient demographics, and comorbidity indices. The results reveal substantial variations in sample sizes across substudies, underscoring the need to align data collection with research objectives and available resources. The distribution of measures demonstrates a balanced approach to healthcare data modalities, ensuring data fairness and equity. The interplay between average age and sample size highlights the significance of tailored privacy-preserving strategies. The comorbidity index distribution provides insights into the health status of the studied population and aids in personalized healthcare. Additionally, the fluctuation of sample sizes over substudies emphasizes the adaptability of privacy-preserving machine learning models in diverse healthcare research scenarios. Overall, this investigation contributes to the evolving landscape of healthcare data sharing by addressing the challenges of data heterogeneity, regulatory compliance, and collaborative model development. The findings empower researchers and healthcare professionals to strike a balance between data utility and privacy preservation, ultimately advancing the field of privacy-preserving machine learning in healthcare research.",

        "abstract": "The digitization of healthcare data has presented a pressing need to address privacy concerns within the realm of machine learning for healthcare institutions. One promising solution is federated learning, which enables collaborative training of deep machine learning models among medical institutions by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. This study focuses on enhancing an existing privacy-preserving federated learning algorithm for medical data through the utilization of homomorphic encryption, building upon prior research. In contrast to the previous paper, this work is based upon Wibawa, using a single key for HE, our proposed solution is a practical implementation of a preprint with a proposed encryption scheme (xMK-CKKS) for implementing multi-key homomorphic encryption. For this, our work first involves modifying a simple “ring learning with error” RLWE scheme. We then fork a popular federated learning framework for Python where we integrate our own communication process with protocol buffers before we locate and modify the library’s existing training loop in order to further enhance the security of model updates with the multi-key homomorphic encryption scheme. Our experimental evaluations validate that, despite these modifications, our proposed framework maintains a robust model performance, as demonstrated by consistent metrics including validation accuracy, precision, f1-score, and recall.",

        "abstract": "The automotive industry has been enhancing autonomous driving systems utilizing the computation and communication networks embedded in vehicles (e.g., cellular networks and sensors) and roadside units (e.g., radar and cameras). Robust security and privacy requirements are essential in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To satisfy these requirements, most developed autonomous driving systems (e.g., Waymo and Tesla) use machine learning. Machine learning models trained on sensitive raw data promise improvements in performance; however, they cannot provide privacy for sensitive raw data and users. Federated learning advances privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by aggregating the model parameter updates from individual devices in a secure manner. Security Credential Management System (SCMS) for Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication provides a guarantee for authentication in a privacy-preserving manner and punishes misbehaving vehicles through misbehavior reporting. In this paper, we design a secure aggregation protocol for privacy-preserving federated learning for vehicular networks. Our protocol allows a server to verify vehicles in a secure manner and is used to aggregate each vehicle-provided global model update for federated learning. We prove our protocol for security in the honest-but-curious framework and detect active adversary attacks, as well as show that it provides trust in different domains (e.g., SCMS and outside the domain of SCMS) and in a privacy-preserving manner for vehicles using SCMS. We analyze the process of federated learning in each vehicle and server while communicating during driving on several types of roads (e.g., local, urban, and rural) using cellular networks (LTE and 5G).",

        "abstract": "Insulators are widely used in distribution network transmission lines and serve as critical components of the distribution network. The detection of insulator faults is essential to ensure the safe and stable operation of the distribution network. Traditional insulator detection methods often rely on manual identification, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and inaccurate. The use of vision sensors for object detection is an efficient and accurate detection method that requires minimal human intervention. Currently, there is a considerable amount of research on the application of vision sensors for insulator fault recognition in object detection. However, centralized object detection requires uploading data collected from various substations through vision sensors to a computing center, which may raise data privacy concerns and increase uncertainty and operational risks in the distribution network. Therefore, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving insulator detection method based on federated learning. An insulator fault detection dataset is constructed, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models are trained within the federated learning framework for insulator fault detection. Most of the existing insulator anomaly detection methods use a centralized model training method, which has the advantage of achieving a target detection accuracy of over 90%, but the disadvantage is that the training process is prone to privacy leakage and lacks privacy protection capability. Compared with the existing insulator target detection methods, the proposed method can also achieve an insulator anomaly detection accuracy of more than 90% and provide effective privacy protection. Through experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of the federated learning framework for insulator fault detection and its ability to protect data privacy while ensuring test accuracy.",

        "abstract": "As people inevitably interact with items across multiple domains or various platforms, cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has gained increasing attention. However, the rising privacy concerns limit the practical applications of existing CDR models since they assume that full or partial data are accessible among different domains. Recent studies on privacy-aware CDR models neglect the heterogeneity from multiple domain data and fail to achieve consistent improvements in cross-domain recommendation; thus, it remains a challenging task to conduct effective CDR in a privacy-preserving way.\n\n            In this paper, we propose a novel federated graph learning approach for\n            P\n            rivacy-\n            P\n            reserving\n            C\n            ross-\n            D\n            omain\n            R\n            ecommendation (denoted as\n            PPCDR\n            ) to capture users’ preferences based on distributed multi-domain data and improve recommendation performance for all domains without privacy leakage. The main idea of PPCDR is to model both global preference among multiple domains and local preference at a specific domain for a given user, which characterizes the user’s shared and domain-specific tastes towards the items for interaction. Specifically, in the private update process of PPCDR, we design a graph transfer module for each domain to fuse global and local user preferences and update them based on local domain data. In the federated update process, through applying the local differential privacy (LDP) technique for privacy-preserving, we collaboratively learn global user preferences based on multi-domain data, and adapt these global preferences to heterogeneous domain data via personalized aggregation. In this way, PPCDR can effectively approximate the multi-domain training process that directly shares local interaction data in a privacy-preserving way. Extensive experiments on three CDR datasets demonstrate that PPCDR consistently outperforms competitive single- and cross-domain baselines and effectively protects domain privacy.\n          ",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL)  has been widely studied recently due to its property to collaboratively train data from different devices without sharing the raw  data. Nevertheless, recent studies show that an adversary can still be possible to infer private information about devices' data, e.g., sensitive attributes such as income, race, and sexual orientation. To mitigate the attribute inference attacks, various existing privacy-preserving FL methods can be adopted/adapted. However, all these existing methods have key limitations: they need to know the FL task in advance, or have intolerable computational overheads or utility losses, or do not have provable privacy guarantees. \n\nWe address these issues and design a task-agnostic privacy-preserving presentation learning method for FL (TAPPFL) against attribute inference attacks. TAPPFL is formulated via information theory. Specifically, \nTAPPFL has two mutual information goals, where one goal learns task-agnostic data representations that contain the least information about the private attribute in each device's data, and the other goal ensures the learnt data representations include as much information as possible about the device data to maintain FL utility. We also derive privacy guarantees of TAPPFL against worst-case attribute inference attacks, as well as the inherent tradeoff between utility preservation and privacy protection. Extensive results on multiple datasets and applications validate the effectiveness of TAPPFL to protect data privacy, maintain the FL utility, and be efficient as well. \nExperimental results also show that TAPPFL outperforms the existing defenses.",

Especially in clinical environments, such as clinical time-to-event studies, large sample sizes are critical but usually not available at a single institution. It has been shown recently that federated learning, combined with privacy-enhancing technologies, is an excellent and privacy-preserving alternative to data sharing.\n\n\nObjective\nThis study aims to develop and validate a privacy-preserving, federated survival support vector machine (SVM) and make it accessible for researchers to perform cross-institutional time-to-event analyses.\n\n\nMethods\nWe extended the survival SVM algorithm to be applicable in federated environments. We further implemented it as a FeatureCloud app, enabling it to run in the federated infrastructure provided by the FeatureCloud platform. Finally, we evaluated our algorithm on 3 benchmark data sets, a large sample size synthetic data set, and a real-world microbiome data set and compared the results to the corresponding central method.\n\n\nResults\nOur federated survival SVM produces highly similar results to the centralized model on all data sets. The maximal difference between the model weights of the central model and the federated model was only 0.001, and the mean difference over all data sets was 0.0002. We further show that by including more data in the analysis through federated learning, predictions are more accurate even in the presence of site-dependent batch effects.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe federated survival SVM extends the palette of federated time-to-event analysis methods by a robust machine learning approach. To our knowledge, the implemented FeatureCloud app is the first publicly available implementation of a federated survival SVM, is freely accessible for all kinds of researchers, and can be directly used within the FeatureCloud platform.\n",

This is motivated by the rapid growth of data worldwide, especially decentralized data which calls for scalable, decenteralized machine learning models which is capable of preserving the privacy of the data of the participating users. Towards this objective, we first motivate and define the problem scope. We then introduce the proposed FLoBC system architecture hinging on a number of key pillars, namely parallelism, decentralization and node update synchronization. In particular, we examine a number of known node update synchronization policies and examine their performance merits and design trade-offs. Finally, we compare the proposed federated learning system to a centralized learning system baseline to demonstrate its performance merits. Our main finding in this paper is that our proposed decentralized learning framework was able to achieve comparable performance to a classic centralized learning system, while distributing the model training process across multiple nodes without sharing their actual data. This provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for training a variety of large machine learning models.\nGraphical abstract",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing attention since it allows for privacy-preserving collaborative training on decentralized clients without explicitly uploading sensitive data to the central server. However, recent works have revealed that it still has the risk of exposing private data to adversaries. In this paper, we conduct reconstruction attacks and enhance inference attacks on various datasets to better understand that sharing trained classification model parameters to a central server is the main problem of privacy leakage in FL. To tackle this problem, a privacy-preserving image distribution sharing scheme with GAN (PPIDSG) is proposed, which consists of a block scrambling-based encryption algorithm, an image distribution sharing method, and local classification training. Specifically, our method can capture the distribution of a target image domain which is transformed by the block encryption algorithm, and upload generator parameters to avoid classifier sharing with negligible influence on model performance. Furthermore, we apply a feature extractor to motivate model utility and train it separately from the classifier. The extensive experimental results and security analyses demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme compared to other state-of-the-art defense methods.

They cannot be shared directly for privacy and security reasons, and this has motivated some scholars to apply federated learning (FL) to remote sensing. However, research has found that federated learning is usually vulnerable to white-box membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a piece of data was participating in model training. In remote sensing, the MIA can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about the model trainers, such as their location and type, as well as time information about the remote sensing equipment. To solve this issue, we consider embedding local differential privacy (LDP) into FL and propose LDP-Fed. LDP-Fed performs local differential privacy perturbation after properly pruning the uploaded parameters, preventing the central server from obtaining the original local models from the participants. To achieve a trade-off between privacy and model performance, LDP-Fed adds different noise levels to the parameters for various layers of the local models. This paper conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the framework’s effectiveness on two remote sensing image datasets and two machine learning benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that remote sensing image classification models are susceptible to MIAs, and our framework can successfully defend against white-box MIA while achieving an excellent global model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThe combination of federated learning and recommender system aims to solve the privacy problems of recommendation through keeping user data locally at the client device during the model training session. However, most existing approaches rely on user devices to fully compute the deep model designed for the large-scale item recommendation; therefore, imposing high calculation and communication overheads on resource-constrained user devices. Consequently, achieving efficient federated recommendations across ubiquitous mobile devices remains an open research problem. To this end, in this paper we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving federated learning framework which is based on the cloud-edge collaboration for large-scale item recommendation called SpFedRec. In our method, to reduce the computation and communication cost of the federated two-tower model, a split learning approach is applied to migrate the item model from participants’ edge devices to the computationally powerful cloud side and compress item data while transmitting. Meanwhile, to enhance the feature representation, the Squeeze-and-Excitation network mechanism is used on the backbone model to optimize the perception of dominant features. Moreover, because the gradients transmitted contain private information about the user; therefore, we propose a multi-party circular secret-sharing chain based on secret sharing for better privacy protection. Extensive experiments using plausible assumptions on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the average computation time and communication cost by 23% and 49%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed model accomplishes comparable performance with other state-of-art federated recommendation models.",

        "abstract": "SummaryFederated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges posed by data silos and the need for global data fusion. It offers a distributed machine learning framework with privacy‐preserving features, allowing model training without the need to collect user data. However, FL also presents significant security and privacy threats that hinder its widespread adoption. The requirements of privacy and security in FL are inherently conflicting. Privacy necessitates the concealment of individual client updates, while security requires the disclosure of client updates to detect anomalies. While most existing research focused on the privacy and security aspects of FL, very few studies have addressed the compatibility of these two demands. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a comprehensive defense scheme that ensures privacy, security, and compatibility in FL. We categorize the existing literature into two key directions: privacy defense and security defense. Privacy defense includes methods based on additive masks, differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environment, whereas security defense encompasses distance‐, performance‐, clustering‐, and similarity‐based anomaly detection techniques and statistical information‐based anomaly update bypassing techniques when the server is trusted and privacy‐compatible anomaly update detection techniques when the server is not trusted. In addition, this article presents decentralized FL solutions based on blockchain. For each direction, we discuss specific technical solutions, their advantages, and disadvantages. By evaluating various defense methods, we identify the most suitable approach to address the primary challenge of “achieving a secure and robust FL system against malicious adversaries while protecting users' privacy.” We then propose a theoretical reference framework for end‐to‐end protection of privacy and security in FL for the key problem, which summarizes the attack surface of FL systems from the client to the server under the security model where the client and server are malicious. Leveraging the strengths and characteristics of existing schemes, our proposed framework integrates multiple techniques to strike a balance between privacy, usability, and efficiency. This framework serves as a valuable reference and provides insights for future work in the field. Finally, we also provide recommendations for future research directions in this field.",

FL has been applied in communication networks, which offers the dual advantage of preserving user privacy and reducing communication overhead. Networking systems and FL are highly complementary. Networking environments provide critical support for data acquisition, edge computing capabilities, round communication/connectivity, and scalable topologies. In turn, FL can leverage capabilities to achieve learning adaptation, low-latency operation, edge intelligence, personalization, and, notably, privacy preservation. In our review, we gather relevant literature and open-source platforms that point out the feasibility of conducting experiments at the confluence of FL and intelligent networking. Our review is structured around key sections, including the introduction of FL concepts, the background of FL applied in networking, and experimental simulations covering networking for FL and FL for networking. Additionally, we delved into case studies showcasing FL potential in optimizing state-of-the-art network optimization objectives, such as learning performance, quality of service, energy, and cost. We also addressed the challenges and outlined future research directions that provide valuable guidance to researchers and practitioners in this trending field.</p>\n\n</abstract>",

        "abstract": "\n            In federated learning, benign participants aim to optimize a global model collaboratively. However, the risk of\n            privacy leakage\n            cannot be ignored in the presence of\n            semi-honest\n            adversaries. Existing research has focused either on designing protection mechanisms or on inventing attacking mechanisms. While the battle between defenders and attackers seems never-ending, we are concerned with one critical question: is it possible to prevent potential attacks in advance? To address this, we propose the first game-theoretic framework that considers both FL defenders and attackers in terms of their respective payoffs, which include computational costs, FL model utilities, and privacy leakage risks. We name this game the federated learning privacy game (FLPG), in which neither defenders nor attackers are aware of all participants’ payoffs. To handle the\n            incomplete information\n            inherent in this situation, we propose associating the FLPG with an\n            oracle\n            that has two primary responsibilities. First, the oracle provides lower and upper bounds of the payoffs for the players. Second, the oracle acts as a correlation device, privately providing suggested actions to each player. With this novel framework, we analyze the optimal strategies of defenders and attackers. Furthermore, we derive and demonstrate conditions under which the attacker, as a rational decision-maker, should always follow the oracle’s suggestion\n            not to attack\n            .\n          ",

        "abstract": "Mobile IoT devices provide a lot of data every day, which provides a strong base for machine learning to succeed. However, the stringent privacy demands associated with mobile IoT data pose significant challenges for its implementation in machine learning tasks. In order to address this challenge, we propose privacy-preserving federated learning framework (P2FLF) in a mobile fog computing environment. By employing federated learning, it is possible to bring together numerous dispersed user sets and collectively train models without the need to upload datasets. Federated learning, an approach to distributed machine learning, has garnered significant attention for its ability to enable collaborative model training without the need to share sensitive data. By utilizing fog nodes deployed at the edge of the network, P2FLF ensures that sensitive mobile IoT data remains local and is not transmitted to the central server. The framework integrates privacy-preserving methods, such as differential privacy and encryption, to safeguard the data throughout the learning process. We evaluate the performance and efficacy of P2FLF through experimental simulations and compare it with existing approaches. The results demonstrate that P2FLF strikes a balance between model accuracy and privacy protection while enabling efficient federated learning in mobile IoT environments. ",
