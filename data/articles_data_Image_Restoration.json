The Rubik's cube approach is used in the article to build security measures for images. Here, the image is encrypted using XOR operations and pixel shuffles, and it is decrypted in a similar manner. Using a key, the XOR operator is used to odd rows and columns of a photograph in order to muddle the relationship between genuine and encrypted images. The same key is reversed and used to align even picture rows and columns. And we discovered that it is a lot safer approach for encryption of images. This technology makes it possible to follow a good process for guaranteeing the security of the image files, which are transmitted practically every second. The algorithm has been tested on a variety of photo types, and the results are shown.",

Focusing on film but valid for moving images in general, the article provides definitions of relevant terms and discusses ethical criteria for restoration and their adaptability for moving images. Mainly the claim for authenticity in restoration opens a wide field of discussion, starting from the question about what is authentic about film. The perception of moving images and the components their aesthetic value is build upon have a great impact on restoration interventions. Digital restoration tools and digitization have gained importance during the last years. While providing a wide field of new solutions, their seemingly endless range of possibilities has lead to a revival of the discussion about ethical and aesthetic aspects in moving image restoration.\r\n",

        "abstract": "Sonovisual is an innovative framework aimed at bridging the gap between static image descriptions and immersive, dynamic narratives. Traditional image descriptions are often limited to static textual representations, lacking the ability to fully convey the visual essence and emotional depth embedded within an image. This project introduces a novel approach that combines cutting-edge image recognition technologies with advanced natural language processing techniques, facilitating the seamless transformation of image features into engaging and vivid narratives. The core of the Sonovisual framework lies in its integration of sophisticated deep learning algorithms, enabling the extraction of intricate visual details and contextual information from images. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, the system can recognize objects, scenes, and intricate visual patterns, and subsequently generate descriptive narratives that not only encapsulate the visual content but also evoke a multisensory experience for the audience. Through the integration of adaptive storytelling techniques, Sonovisual dynamically adapts its narrative style and tone to cater to different audiences and contexts. By incorporating sentiment analysis and contextual understanding, the framework ensures that the generated narratives resonate with the emotional nuances and cultural sensitivities associated with the depicted imagery. The Sonovisual project holds promise for various applications, including enriching accessibility features for the visually impaired, enhancing educational materials with immersive visual narratives, and augmenting multimedia content with engaging storytelling elements. Additionally, its potential extends to fostering new avenues for creative expression and facilitating enhanced human-computer interaction through visually enriched storytelling experiences.",

        "abstract": "The problem of image signal processing in the information system with adaptive antenna array based on the inversion of sample estimates of correlation matrix of observations is considered. The example of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio criterion shows the problem, inherent in classical methods of finding the optimal weight vector under a priori uncertainty conditions when detecting correlated image signals. It has been concluded that the dependence of these methods on the inverse of estimation of the correlation matrix of observations leads to the impossibility of separating correlated image signals. As a consequence, the use of classical methods of finding the optimal weight vector in the information system with adaptive antenna array is effective only in the case of image restoration from a single signal source, with the signal received on the set of independent jamming background. A novel method, invariant to the correlation of image signals, has been developed for finding the optimal weight vector without the usage of correlation matrix of observations. An image restoration algorithm invariant to correlation of image signals in the information system with adaptive antenna array is proposed. Statistical models have been constructed for the classical method based on the criterion of maximum signal-to-noise ratio and invariant to correlation method of image restoration in following cases: a single source against the jamming background of two independent sources; two independent sources against the jamming background. Simulation results in the information system with adaptive antenna array are presented, showing to visually assess efficiency of proposed methods of image signal restoration using optimal weight vector. Detailed analysis of the results obtained is carried out.",

        "abstract": "Generalist methods for cellular segmentation have good out-of-the-box performance on a variety of image types. However, existing methods struggle for images that are degraded by noise, blurred or undersampled, all of which are common in microscopy. We focused the development of Cellpose3 on addressing these cases, and here we demonstrate substantial out-of-the-box gains in segmentation and image quality for noisy, blurry or undersampled images. Unlike previous approaches, which train models to restore pixel values, we trained Cellpose3 to output images that are well-segmented by a generalist segmentation model, while maintaining perceptual similarity to the target images. Furthermore, we trained the restoration models on a large, varied collection of datasets, thus ensuring good generalization to user images. We provide these tools as “one-click” buttons inside the graphical interface of Cellpose as well as in the Cellpose API.",

The process of taking a noisy image and obtaining the clean, original image is called as image restoration. This process is applied in every field where images have to be understood and analyzed. Image restoration is a method of recovering an original image from a degraded image. To restore corrupted image into its original form restoration techniques are used. The restoration techniques mainly focused to improve the image quality. Usually image processing techniques are implemented in the two domains, they are frequency domain or spatial domain. This paper mainly focused on different approaches to restoration, variations between frequency domain methods and spatial domain methods. Especially the relation between spatial and frequency resolutions and various filters in spatial and frequency domain. The present work shows the performance of different kinds of filters and these filters are analyzed by implementing and simulating on MATLAB.",

The Haar wavelet transform is applied on the input image and its contrast stretched image to generate the degraded wavelet coefficients which are refined using Gaussian pyramid of the saliency weights to restore the original image. The ensemble of triple corrections exerts three elite color correction algorithms sequentially on the degraded image for restoration. The ensemble of algorithms covers red channel mean shifting, global RGB adaptation, global luminance adaptation, global saturation adaptation, luminance stretching, saturation stretching, contrast stretching, adaptive Gamma correction for red spectrum, even to odd middle intensity transference using look-up table, green to red spectrum transference using histogram equalization, local brightening, Dark Channel Prior (DCP), fusion restoration, and our Haar wavelet transform restoration.

        "abstract": "When the image quality is evaluated, the human visual system (HVS) infers the details in the image through its internal generative mechanism. In this process, the HVS integrates both local and global information of the image, utilizes contextual information to restore the original image information, and compares it with the distorted image information for image quality evaluation. Inspired by this mechanism, a no-reference image quality assessment method is proposed based on a multitask image restoration network. The multitask image restoration network generates a pseudo-reference image as the main task and produces structural similarity index measure map as an auxiliary task. By mutually promoting the two tasks, a higher quality pseudo-reference image is generated. In addition, when predicting the image quality score, both the quality restoration features and the difference features between the distorted and reference images are used, thereby fully utilizing the information from the pseudo-reference image. To enable the model to focus on both global and local features, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance on both synthetically and authentically distorted databases.",

Therefore, a fuzzy defect image restoration and enhancement method based on neural network is proposed. A double fusion neural network composed of a depth generation network and a discrimination network is designed. The residual of the denoised fuzzy image and the real image is output by the network, which is input into the discrimination network together with the real image, and the difference between the two is judged by the total loss function. To solve the problem of pixel coordinate value of fuzzy defect image, neural network is used to build a fast correction algorithm. Therefore, a fuzzy image restoration and enhancement method based on neural network is proposed to improve the image quality. By reconstructing the resolution of fuzzy defect image, a hierarchical enhancement method of fuzzy defect image region is constructed to achieve fuzzy defect image restoration and enhancement. The results show that the proposed method has high image processing ability in restoration and enhancement of fuzzy defect images. The fitting value of neural network is 0.92, which is significantly higher than that of the other two methods, indicating that the image restoration and enhancement method based on neural network has higher accuracy. Therefore, the restoration and enhancement method of fuzzy defect image based on neural network has a good restoration and enhancement effect, and can effectively meet the actual needs of people for high-quality images.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    ",

The method of proof and the imposed conditions on the iterative parameters are different from those already available in the literature . We then present some applications to the Douglas - Rachford splitting method and image restoration problems , and compare the performance of our method with that of other popular inertial Krasnosel'skiĭ-Mann methods which can be found in the literature.\n2020 MSC classification: 47H05, 47J20, 47J25, 65K15, 90C25.",

        "abstract": "This chapter looks at how English authors debated the moral and intellectual foundations of overseas expansion. The English view of territorial empire was tinged with ambivalence. While great empires could be acclaimed as agents for human improvement, the prospect was viewed by many commentators through the prism of Roman, Renaissance, and Protestant texts that warned against territorial expansion as the forerunner of despotism, luxury, and decline. English authors crossed swords over the ways to make their emerging empire Christian, virtuous, and durable. One cohort argued that the Spanish model of territorial conquest and the Christian mission could be adopted and purified by a Protestant realm. Other voices promoted a commercial “empire of the seas,” centered only on control over selective ports, islands, and peninsulas, as the way to achieve national enrichment without the moral dangers arising from territorial occupation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nWith the development of full-screen devices, smartphone manufacturers have started to explore placing the camera behind the screen, offering larger display-to-body ratios. However, this under-display camera (UDC) imaging system causes varying degrees of degradation for captured RGB images. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight dual-domain network (LD2Net) for restoring UDC images. Specifically, first, the UDC image is decomposed into reflection and illumination images. Then, an amplitude-phase mutual guided block is designed to reconstruct the reflection image in the frequency domain and restore the attenuated highfrequency components. Meanwhile, we employ a multi-scale hybrid dilated convolution block to reconstruct the degeneracy of UDC images in the spatial domain. Finally, the feature maps of the spatial and frequency domain outputs are fused to recover a clear image. In addition, we propose a global perceptual loss function based on the Transformer framework to help LD2Net reconstruct clearer textures and colors. Extensive experiments show that our model can achieve superior results with relatively few parameters. The valid URL for our code is at https://github.com/zzr-idam/LD2Net.",
