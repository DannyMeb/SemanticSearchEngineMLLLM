Matthew J. Smith uses Cymbeline to demonstrate the continual relevance of theatrical recognition for the philosophical discourse on mutual recognition as represented by writers including Hegel, Levinas, and Ricoeur. Cymbeline gestures toward tragedy by staging failures of recognition but ultimately moves into the post-tragic through what Smith describes as a return to anagnorisis.",

In these settings, automatic face recognition systems have increased in prevalence and accuracy in recent years. As a result, the identification task, which once fell entirely to humans, is now a process performed by man and machine. Automatic face recognition systems provide image similarity comparisons and can create candidate lists to narrow down potential targets. There is increasing interest in the accuracy of these systems, and the role that algorithms can play in the identification effort. The design, operational usage, and effectiveness of these automatic systems, as well as the interaction of human and computer recognition are the topics of this chapter.",

Linking literary face to textual face – the whole text as a kind of face – he applies the lessons learnt from facial recognition to textual recognition; and answers some possible objections to the paradox of knowing being dependent on having already known.",

        "abstract": "Response times (RTs) are commonly used to assess cognitive abilities and have more recently been employed to assess face recognition ability. However, it is unclear whether face processing RTs predict recognition ability beyond accuracy. In the current study, we examined accuracy and RT on a widely used face matching assessment modified to collect meaningful RT data, the computerized Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT-c), and measured whether RTs predicted face recognition ability and developmental prosopagnosia (DP) vs. control group membership. 62 controls and 36 DPs performed the BFRT-c as well as validated measures of face recognition ability: the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) and a Famous Faces Memory Test (FFMT). We found little-to-no association between BFRT-c accuracy and RT in both controls (r=.07, p=.59) and DPs (r=.03, p=.86). In controls, BFRT-c accuracy robustly predicted CFMT performance (r=.49, p&lt;.001), FFMT performance (r=.43, p&lt;.001), and a CFMT-FFMT composite (r=.54, p&lt;.001), whereas BFRT-c RT was not significantly associated with these measures (all r's&lt;.16, p's&gt;.21). We found that BFRT-c accuracy significantly differed between DPs and controls, but RT failed to differentiate the groups. Results in controls and DPs were unchanged after outlier removal. Further, combined scores of BFRT-c accuracy and RT (inverse efficiency score and balanced integration score) did not predict face recognition ability or DP vs. control group membership better than accuracy alone. These results suggest that the BFRT-c RT is not useful for characterizing individual differences in face recognition and, more generally, emphasizes the importance of validating RT measures before using them as individual difference/diagnostic measures.",

        "abstract": "SummaryFaces are processed by specialized neural mechanisms in high-level visual cortex. How does this divergence to a face-specific and an object-general system contribute to face recognition? Recent advances in machine face recognition together with our understanding of how humans recognize faces enable us to address this fundamental question. We hypothesized that face recognition depends on a face-selective system that is tuned to view-invariant facial features, which cannot be accomplished by an object-general system. To test this hypothesis, we used deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that were optimized for face or object recognition. Consistent with the hierarchical architecture of the visual system, results show that a human-like, view-invariant face representation emerges only at higher layers of a face-trained but not the object-trained neural network. Thus, by combining human psychophysics and computational modelling of the visual system, we revealed how the functional organization of the visual cortex may contribute to recognition.",

        "abstract": "AbstractWhile there have been decades of clinical and theoretical interest in developmental and acquired face recognition difficulties, very little work has examined their remediation. Here, we report two studies that examined the efficacy of an existing face training programme in improving face-processing skills in adults and children with developmental face recognition impairments. The programme has only been trialled in typical children to date, where 2 weeks of perceptual training (modelled on an adapted version of the popular family game Guess Who?) resulted in face-specific improvements for memory but not perception after 2 weeks of training. In Study 1, we performed a randomized, parallel groups, placebo-controlled trial of the same programme in 20 adults with a pre-existing diagnosis of developmental prosopagnosia. Assessment tasks were administered immediately before and after training, and 2 weeks later. Face-specific gains in memory (but not perception) were observed in the experimental group and were greatest in those with the poorest face recognition skills at entry. These gains persisted 2 weeks after training ceased. In Study 2, a case-series approach was used to administer the experimental version of the training programme to four children who presented with difficulties in face recognition. Improvements in face memory were observed in three of the participants; while one also improved at face perception, there was mixed evidence for the face specificity of these gains. Together, these findings suggest plasticity in the human face recognition system through to at least mid-adulthood and also pave the way for longer-term implementations of the face training programme that will likely elicit greater gains in both adults and children.",
