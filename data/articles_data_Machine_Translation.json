        "abstract": "Language comprehension is the capacity of someone to properly understand the language to fully communicate the message and details. When dialects are distinct, the problem arises. This condition can lead to misconception as understudies, particularly those whose specialty is not English, cannot gain real importance. Along these lines, interpreting is regarded as one of the suggested arrangements in this area. As the results, the message's basic significance and setting in an unknown dialect can be precisely seen in English. Interpretation is a help to resolve this language boundary for this case. Moreover, finding an individual who is accessible to decipher each and every language is found troublesome. Furthermore, the aftereffect of interpretation is by one way or another influenced and impacted by the interpreter's abilities. In this manner, interpretation application turns into the one to be depended on. A lot of online interpretation applications have been made available for the last few years. The best one is Google Translate which is a multi-lingual online computer interpretation (MT) system. It is said as a multilanguage interpretation programme, as it can decode material from over 90 dialects.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSelf-attention-based encoder-decoder frameworks have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The self-attention mechanism generates contextual representations by attending to all tokens in the sentence. Despite improvements in performance, recent research argues that the self-attention mechanism tends to concentrate more on the global context with less emphasis on the contextual information available within the local neighbourhood of tokens. This work presents the Dual Contextual (DC) module, an extension of the conventional self-attention unit, to effectively leverage both the local and global contextual information. The goal is to further improve the sentence representation ability of the encoder and decoder subnetworks, thus enhancing the overall performance of the translation model. Experimental results on WMT’14 English-German (En$$\\rightarrow $$\n→\nDe) and eight IWSLT translation tasks show that the DC module can further improve the translation performance of the Transformer model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper presents a set of effective approaches to handle extremely low-resource language pairs for self-attention based neural machine translation (NMT) focusing on English and four Asian languages. Starting from an initial set of parallel sentences used to train bilingual baseline models, we introduce additional monolingual corpora and data processing techniques to improve translation quality. We describe a series of best practices and empirically validate the methods through an evaluation conducted on eight translation directions, based on state-of-the-art NMT approaches such as hyper-parameter search, data augmentation with forward and backward translation in combination with tags and noise, as well as joint multilingual training. Experiments show that the commonly used default architecture of self-attention NMT models does not reach the best results, validating previous work on the importance of hyper-parameter tuning. Additionally, empirical results indicate the amount of synthetic data required to efficiently increase the parameters of the models leading to the best translation quality measured by automatic metrics. We show that the best NMT models trained on large amount of tagged back-translations outperform three other synthetic data generation approaches. Finally, comparison with statistical machine translation (SMT) indicates that extremely low-resource NMT requires a large amount of synthetic parallel data obtained with back-translation in order to close the performance gap with the preceding SMT approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe new paradigm of neural machine translation is leading to profound changes in the translation industry. Surprisingly good results have led to high expectations; however, there are substantial risks that have not yet been sufficiently taken into account. Risks exist on three levels: first, what kind of damage can clients and end users incur in safety-critical domains if the NMT result contains errors; second, who is liable for damage caused by the use of NMT; third, what cyber risks can the use of NMT entail, especially when free online engines are used. When establishing sustainable measures to reduce such risks, we also need to consider general principles of human behaviour if we want to make sure that all agents comply with provisions and requirements.",

        "abstract": "AbstractNeural machine translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation (MT) that uses deep learning techniques, a broad area of machine learning based on deep artificial neural networks (NNs). The book Neural Machine Translation by Philipp Koehn targets a broad range of readers including researchers, scientists, academics, advanced undergraduate or postgraduate students, and users of MT, covering wider topics including fundamental and advanced neural network-based learning techniques and methodologies used to develop NMT systems. The book demonstrates different linguistic and computational aspects in terms of NMT with the latest practices and standards and investigates problems relating to NMT. Having read this book, the reader should be able to formulate, design, implement, critically assess and evaluate some of the fundamental and advanced deep learning techniques and methods used for MT. Koehn himself notes that he was somewhat overtaken by events, as originally this book was envisaged only as a chapter in a revised, extended version of his 2009 book Statistical Machine Translation. However, in the interim, NMT completely overtook this previously dominant paradigm, and this new book is likely to serve as the reference of note for the field for some time to come, despite the fact that new techniques are coming onstream all the time.",

        "abstract": "AbstractExamining the general impact of Controlled Language (CL) rules in the context of Machine Translation (MT) has been an area of research for many years. The present study focuses on the following question: how do CL rules impact MT outputindividually? By analysing a German corpus-based test suite of technical texts that have been translated into English by different MT systems, this study endeavours to answer this question at different levels: the general impact of CL rules (rule- and system-independent), their impact at rule level (system-independent) as well as at rule and system level. The results of five MT systems are analysed and contrasted: a rule-based system, a statistical system, two differently constructed hybrid systems, and a neural system. For this, a mixed-methods triangulation approach that includes error annotation, human evaluation, and automatic evaluation was applied. The data was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of CL influence on the following parameters: number and type of MT errors, style and content quality, and scores of two automatic evaluation metrics. In line with many studies, the results show a general positive impact of the applied CL rules on the MT output. However, at rule level, only four rules proved to have positive effects on the aforementioned parameters; three rules had negative effects on the parameters; and two rules did not show any significant impact. At rule and system level, the rules affected the MT systems differently, as expected. Rules that had a positive impact on earlier MT approaches did not show the same impact on the neural MT approach. Furthermore, neural MT delivered distinctly better results than earlier MT approaches, namely the highest error-free, style and content quality rates both before and after applying the rules, which indicates that neural MT offers a promising solution that no longer requires CL rules for improving the MT output.",
