        "abstract": "We propose UnMixMatch, a semi-supervised learning framework which can learn effective representations from unconstrained unlabelled data in order to scale up performance. Most existing semi-supervised methods rely on the assumption that labelled and unlabelled samples are drawn from the same distribution, which limits the potential for improvement through the use of free-living unlabeled data. Consequently, the generalizability and scalability of semi-supervised learning are often hindered by this assumption. Our method aims to overcome these constraints and effectively utilize unconstrained unlabelled data in semi-supervised learning. UnMixMatch consists of three main components: a supervised learner with hard augmentations that provides strong regularization, a contrastive consistency regularizer to learn underlying representations from the unlabelled data, and a self-supervised loss to enhance the representations that are learnt from the unlabelled data. We perform extensive experiments on 4 commonly used datasets and demonstrate superior performance over existing semi-supervised methods with a performance boost of 4.79%. Extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show the effectiveness and impact of each of the proposed components of our method. The code for our work is publicly available.",

        "abstract": "AbstractShort text information has considerable commercial value and immeasurable social value. Natural language processing and short text sentiment analysis technology can organize and analyze short text information on the Internet. Natural language processing tasks such as sentiment classification have achieved satisfactory performance under a supervised learning framework. However, traditional supervised learning relies on large-scale and high-quality manual labels and obtaining high-quality label data costs a lot. Therefore, the strong dependence on label data hinders the application of the deep learning model to a large extent, which is the bottleneck of supervised learning. At the same time, short text datasets such as product reviews have an imbalance in the distribution of data samples. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a method to predict label data according to semi-supervised learning mode and implements the MixMatchNL data enhancement method. Meanwhile, the Bert pre-training model is updated. The cross-entropy loss function in the model is improved to the Focal Loss function to alleviate the data imbalance in short text datasets. Experimental results based on public datasets indicate the proposed model has improved the accuracy of short text sentiment recognition compared with the previous update and other state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning has made remarkable achievements in the self-supervised representation learning of graph-structured data. By employing perturbation function (i.e., perturbation on the nodes or edges of graph), most graph contrastive learning methods construct contrastive samples on the original graph. However, the perturbation-based data augmentation methods randomly change the inherent information (e.g., attributes or structures) of the graph. Therefore, after nodes embedding on the perturbed graph, we cannot guarantee the validity of the contrastive samples as well as the learned performance of graph contrastive learning. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel generation-based multi-view contrastive learning framework (GMVC) for self-supervised graph representation learning, which generates the contrastive samples based on our generator rather than perturbation function. Specifically, after nodes embedding on the original graph we first employ random walk in the neighborhood to develop multiple relevant node sequences for each anchor node. We then utilize the transformer to generate the representations of relevant contrastive samples of anchor node based on the features and structures of the sampled node sequences. Finally, by maximizing the consistency between the anchor view and the generated views, we force the model to effectively encode graph information into nodes embeddings. We perform extensive experiments of node classification and link prediction tasks on eight benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our generation-based multi-view graph contrastive learning method.",

This study proposes a self-supervised data assimilation model with a new loss function to provide global TWSAs with a spatial resolution of 0.5Â°. The model combines hydrological simulations as well as measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) satellite missions. The efficiency of the high-resolution information is proved by closing the water balance equation in small basins while preserving large-scale accuracy inherited from the GRACE(-FO) measurements. The product contributes to monitoring natural hazards locally and shows potential for better understanding the impacts of natural and anthropogenic activities on the water cycle. We anticipate our approach to be generally applicable to other TWSA data sources and the resulting products to be valuable for the geoscience community and society.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nRepresentation learning has proven to be a powerful methodology in a wide variety of machine-learning applications. For atmospheric dynamics, however, it has so far not been considered, arguably due to the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets that could be used for training. In this work, we show how to sidestep the difficulty and introduce a self-supervised learning task that is applicable to a wide variety of unlabeled atmospheric datasets. Specifically, we train a neural network on the simple yet intricate task of predicting the temporal distance between atmospheric fields from distinct but nearby times. We demonstrate that training with this task on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset leads to internal representations that capture intrinsic aspects of atmospheric dynamics. For example, when employed as a loss function in other machine-learning applications, the derived AtmoDist distance leads to improved results compared to the \n\n\n$ {\\mathrm{\\ell}}_2 $\n\n-loss. For downscaling one obtains higher resolution fields that match the true statistics more closely than previous approaches and for the interpolation of missing or occluded data the AtmoDist distance leads to results that contain more realistic fine-scale features. Since it is obtained from observational data, AtmoDist also provides a novel perspective on atmospheric predictability.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning on graphs has recently drawn a lot of attention due to its independence from labels and its robustness in representation. Current studies on this topic mainly use static information such as graph structures but cannot well capture dynamic information such as timestamps of edges. Realistic graphs are often dynamic, which means the interaction between nodes occurs at a specific time. This article proposes a self-supervised dynamic graph representation learning framework DySubC, which defines a temporal subgraph contrastive learning task to simultaneously learn the structural and evolutional features of a dynamic graph. Specifically, a novel temporal subgraph sampling strategy is firstly proposed, which takes each node of the dynamic graph as the central node and uses both neighborhood structures and edge timestamps to sample the corresponding temporal subgraph. The subgraph representation function is then designed according to the influence of neighborhood nodes on the central node after encoding the nodes in each subgraph. Finally, the structural and temporal contrastive loss are defined to maximize the mutual information between node representation and temporal subgraph representation. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that (1) DySubC performs better than the related baselines including two graph contrastive learning models and five dynamic graph representation learning models, especially in the link prediction task, and (2) the use of temporal information cannot only sample more effective subgraphs, but also learn better representation by temporal contrastive loss.",

Two state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods, DINO and data2vec, were evaluated and compared for their representation learning of vehicle images. The former contrasts local and global views while the latter uses masked prediction on multiple layered representations. In the latter case, supervised learning is employed to finetune a pretrained YOLOR object detector for detecting vehicle wheels, from which definitive wheel positional features are retrieved. The representations learned from these self-supervised learning methods were combined with the wheel positional features for the vehicle classification task. Particularly, a random wheel masking strategy was utilized to finetune the previously learned representations in harmony with the wheel positional features during the training of the classifier. Our experiments show that the data2vec-distilled representations, which are consistent with our wheel masking strategy, outperformed the DINO counterpart, resulting in a celebrated Top-1 classification accuracy of 97.2% for classifying the 13 vehicle classes defined by the Federal Highway Administration.",

In this article, we systematically review the existing research literature in this space to answer the following five research questions. What types of representations were learnt? What SSRL models were used? What downstream problems were the representations used to solve? What machine learning models were used to solve these problems?

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nCitizen science is gaining popularity as a valuable tool for labelling large collections of astronomical images by the general public. This is often achieved at the cost of poorer quality classifications made by amateur participants, which are usually verified by employing smaller data sets labelled by professional astronomers. Despite its success, citizen science alone will not be able to handle the classification of current and upcoming surveys. To alleviate this issue, citizen science projects have been coupled with machine learning techniques in pursuit of a more robust automated classification. However, existing approaches have neglected the fact that, apart from the data labelled by amateurs, (limited) expert knowledge of the problem is also available along with vast amounts of unlabelled data that have not yet been exploited within a unified learning framework. This paper presents an innovative learning methodology for citizen science capable of taking advantage of expert- and amateur-labelled data, featuring a transfer of labels between experts and amateurs. The proposed approach first learns from unlabelled data with a convolutional auto-encoder and then exploits amateur and expert labels via the pre-training and fine-tuning of a convolutional neural network, respectively. We focus on the classification of galaxy images from the Galaxy Zoo project, from which we test binary, multiclass, and imbalanced classification scenarios. The results demonstrate that our solution is able to improve classification performance compared to a set of baseline approaches, deploying a promising methodology for learning from different confidence levels in data labelling.",

Following a data-driven approach, we propose an online and multivariate anomaly detection method that is suitable for the timely and accurate detection of anomalies. We propose our method for both semi-supervised and supervised settings. By combining the semi-supervised and supervised algorithms, we present a self-supervised online learning algorithm in which the semi-supervised algorithm trains the supervised algorithm to improve its detection performance over time. The methods are comprehensively analyzed in terms of computational complexity, asymptotic optimality, and false alarm rate. The performances of the proposed algorithms are also evaluated using real-world cybersecurity datasets, that show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "AbstractDynamometer card is one of the vital surveillances for Sucker Rod Pump (SRP) performance monitoring in Duri field. Even though the field produces a massive number of cards, they come with no label or interpretation about the pump conditions based on the card shape. Self-supervised learning (SSL) consists of a pretext task that trains feature extractors by using unlabeled data as opposed to supervised learning, that requires a lot of effort in labeling data which is time consuming and costly. This paper evaluates the performance of a feature extractor, Alexnet, that is trained by using several pretext task techniques. This study used around 660,000 unlabeled cards while a small amount of labeled data was used for evaluation purposes using linear evaluation protocol. The result showed that the trained Alexnet using Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) with jigsaw has better performance by 6% compared to the pre-trained ImageNet model. Further fine-tuning process by using labeled data could achieve 93% accuracy. The model was also tested using fresh data and the result was compared to the expert's interpretation. This approach can potentially add more types of rod pump problems to detect in the Duri field with considerable precision. In addition, the new approach could improve the current method of detecting more SRP with valve leaking problems.",

        "abstract": "The recently developed unsupervised graph representation learning approaches apply contrastive learning into graph-structured data and achieve promising performance. However, these methods mainly focus on graph augmentation for positive samples, while the negative mining strategies for graph contrastive learning are less explored, leading to sub-optimal performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a Graph Adversarial Contrastive Learning (GraphACL) scheme that learns a bank of negative samples for effective self-supervised whole-graph representation learning. Our GraphACL consists of (i) a graph encoding branch that generates the representations of positive samples and (ii) an adversarial generation branch that produces a bank of negative samples. To generate more powerful hard negative samples, our method minimizes the contrastive loss during encoding updating while maximizing the contrastive loss adversarially over the negative samples for providing the challenging contrastive task. Moreover, the quality of representations produced by the adversarial generation branch is enhanced through the regularization of carefully designed bank divergence loss and bank orthogonality loss. We optimize the parameters of the graph encoding branch and adversarial generation branch alternately. Extensive experiments on 14 real-world benchmarks on both graph classification and transfer learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing graph self-supervised representation learning methods.",

We introduce a method that leverages the paradigm of self-supervised machine learning in a novel manner to construct representative summaries of massive data sets using simulation-based augmentations. Deploying the method on hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we show that it can deliver highly informative summaries, which can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including precise and accurate parameter inference. We demonstrate how this paradigm can be used to construct summary representations that are insensitive to prescribed systematic effects, such as the influence of baryonic physics. Our results indicate that self-supervised machine learning techniques offer a promising new approach for compression of cosmological data as well as its analysis.",

        "abstract": "AbstractA crucial step in the analysis of single-cell data is annotating cells to cell types and states. While a myriad of approaches has been proposed, manual labeling of cells to create training datasets remains tedious and time-consuming. In the field of machine learning, active and self-supervised learning methods have been proposed to improve the performance of a classifier while reducing both annotation time and label budget. However, the benefits of such strategies for single-cell annotation have yet to be evaluated in realistic settings. Here, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of active and self-supervised labeling strategies across a range of single-cell technologies and cell type annotation algorithms. We quantify the benefits of active learning and self-supervised strategies in the presence of cell type imbalance and variable similarity. We introduce adaptive reweighting, a heuristic procedure tailored to single-cell dataâincluding a marker-aware versionâthat shows competitive performance with existing approaches. In addition, we demonstrate that having prior knowledge of cell type markers improves annotation accuracy. Finally, we summarize our findings into a set of recommendations for those implementing cell type annotation procedures or platforms. An R package implementing the heuristic approaches introduced in this work may be found at https://github.com/camlab-bioml/leader.",

        "abstract": "Interactions of users and items can be naturally modeled as a user-item bipartite graph in recommender systems, and emerging research is devoted to exploring user-item graphs for collaborative filtering methods. In reality, user-item interaction usually stems from more complex underlying factors, such as the usersâ specific preferences. A user-item bipartite graph could be used to understand the differences in motivation. However, existing research has not clearly proposed and modeled the factors that affect the differences, ignoring the similarities between user pairs and item pairs, preventing them from capturing fine-grained user preferences more effectively. In addition to the two points mentioned above, most GNN-based models for recommendation have the following two limitations: First, the modelâs accuracy depends on the number of observed interactions in the dataset. Secondly, node representations are vulnerable to noisy interactions. This work has developed a novel recommendation model called âMulti-Attribute and Implicit Relationship Factors With Self-Supervised Learning for Collaborative filteringâ (MIS-CF), which explicitly proposes and models multi-attribute and implicit relationship factors for collaborative filtering recommendation. Meanwhile, an auxiliary self-supervised learning task is designed to help the downstream task optimize the node representation. MIS-CF aggregates multi-attribute spaces through the user-item bipartite graph and establishes user-user and item-item graphs to model the similar relationship information of neighbor pairs through a memory model. The self-supervised learning task generates contrastive learning via self-discrimination, thus mining the rich auxiliary signals within the data, improving the accuracy and robustness of our model. Moreover, the sparse regularizer is utilized to alleviate the overfitting problem. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets not only show the significant performance and robustness gain of the proposed model but also prove the effectiveness and interpretability of fine-grained implicit factors modeling.",

        "abstract": "Forecasting the block maxima of a future time window is a challenging task due to the difficulty in inferring the tail distribution of a target variable. As the historical observations alone may not be sufficient to train robust models to predict the block maxima, domain-driven process models are often available in many scientific domains to supplement the observation data and improve the forecast accuracy. Unfortunately, coupling the historical observations with process model outputs is a challenge due to their disparate temporal coverage. This paper presents Self-Recover, a deep learning framework to predict the block maxima of a time window by employing self-supervised learning to address the varying temporal data coverage problem. Specifically Self-Recover uses a combination of contrastive and generative self-supervised learning schemes along with a denoising autoencoder to impute the missing values. The framework also combines representations of the historical observations with process model outputs via a residual learning approach and learns the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution characterizing the block maxima values. This enables the framework to reliably estimate the block maxima of each time window along with its confidence interval. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Self-Recover compared to other state-of-the-art forecasting methods.",

        "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment and improved patient survival rates. While deep learning techniques have emerged as the leading approach for medical image analysis and processing, the most commonly employed supervised learning often requires large, high-quality annotated datasets that can be costly to obtain, particularly for pixel/voxel-wise image segmentation. To address this challenge and facilitate ICH treatment decisions, we introduce a novel weakly supervised method for ICH segmentation, utilizing a Swin transformer trained on an ICH classification task with categorical labels. Our approach leverages a hierarchical combination of head-wise gradient-infused self-attention maps to generate accurate image segmentation. Additionally, we conducted an exploratory study on different learning strategies and showed that binary ICH classification has a more positive impact on self-attention maps compared to full ICH subtyping. With a mean Dice score of 0.44, our technique achieved similar ICH segmentation performance as the popular U-Net and Swin-UNETR models with full supervision and outperformed a similar weakly supervised approach using GradCAM, demonstrating the excellent potential of the proposed framework in challenging medical image segmentation tasks.

        "abstract": "Remote sensing data has been widely used for various Earth Observation (EO) missions such as land use and cover classification, weather forecasting, agricultural management, and environmental monitoring. Most existing remote-sensing-data-based models are based on supervised learning that requires large and representative human-labeled data for model training, which is costly and time-consuming. The recent introduction of self-supervised learning (SSL) enables models to learn a representation from orders of magnitude more unlabeled data. The success of SSL is heavily dependent on a pre-designed pretext task, which introduces an inductive bias into the model from a large amount of unlabeled data. Since remote sensing imagery has rich spectral information beyond the standard RGB color space, it may not be straightforward to extend to the multi/hyperspectral domain the pretext tasks established in computer vision based on RGB images. To address this challenge, this work proposed a generic self-supervised learning framework based on remote sensing data at both the object and pixel levels. The method contains two novel pretext tasks, one for object-based and one for pixel-based remote sensing data analysis methods. One pretext task is used to reconstruct the spectral profile from the masked data, which can be used to extract a representation of pixel information and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with pixel-based analysis. The second pretext task is used to identify objects from multiple views of the same object in multispectral data, which can be used to extract a representation and improve the performance of downstream tasks associated with object-based analysis. The results of two typical downstream task evaluation exercises (a multilabel land cover classification task on Sentinel-2 multispectral datasets and a ground soil parameter retrieval task on hyperspectral datasets) demonstrate that the proposed SSL method learns a target representation that covers both spatial and spectral information from massive unlabeled data. A comparison with currently available SSL methods shows that the proposed method, which emphasizes both spectral and spatial features, outperforms existing SSL methods on multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing datasets. We believe that this approach has the potential to be effective in a wider range of remote sensing applications and we will explore its utility in more remote sensing applications in the future.",

However, the scarcity of labeled datasets for emerging target defects poses a significant obstacle. This study proposes a self-supervised representation-learning model that effectively addresses this limitation by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data. The proposed model was developed based on a contrastive learning framework, supported by an augmentation pipeline and a lightweight convolutional encoder. The effectiveness of the proposed approach for representation learning was evaluated using an unlabeled pretraining dataset created from three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model was validated using the NEU metal surface-defect dataset. The results revealed that the proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 97.78%, even with fewer trainable parameters than the benchmark models. Overall, the proposed model effectively extracted meaningful representations from unlabeled image data and can be employed in downstream tasks for steel defect classification to improve quality control and reduce inspection costs.",

        "abstract": "With the accumulation of check-in data from location-based services, next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations are gaining increasing attention. It is well known that the spatio-temporal contextual information of user check-in behavior plays a crucial role in handling vital and inherent challenges in next POI recommendation, including capture of user dynamic preferences and the sparsity problem of check-in data. However, many studies either ignore or simply stack the context features with the embedding of POIs while relying only on POI recommendation loss to optimize the entire model, therefore failing to take full advantage of the potential information in contexts. Additionally, usersâ interests are usually unstable and evolve over time, and accordingly recent studies have proposed various approaches to predict usersâ next POIs by incorporating contextual information and modeling both their long- and short-term preferences, respectively. Yet many studies overemphasize the final POI recommendation performance, and the association between POI sequences and contextual information is not well embodied in data representations. In this article, we focus on the preceding problems and propose a unified attention framework for next POI recommendation by modeling usersâ Long- and Short-term Preferences via Self-supervised Learning (LSPSL). Specifically, based on the self-attention network and two self-supervised optimization objectives, LSPSL first deeply exploits the intrinsic correlations between POI sequences and contextual information through pre-training, which strengthens data representations. Then, supported by pre-trained contextualized embeddings, LSPSL models and fuses usersâ complex long- and short-term preferences in a unified way. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Language as an abstraction for hierarchical agents is promising to solve compositional long-time horizon decision-making tasks. The learning of the agent poses significant challenges, as it typically requires plenty of trajectories annotated with languages. This paper addresses the challenge of learning such an agent under the scarcity of language annotations. One approach for leveraging unannotated data is to generate pseudo-labels for unannotated trajectories using sparse seed annotations. However, as the scenes of the environment and tasks assigned to the agent are diverse, the inference of language instructions is sometimes incorrect, causing the policy to learn to ground incorrect instructions to actions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised language-conditioned hierarchical skill policy (SLHSP) which utilizes unannotated data to learn reusable and general task-related skills to facilitate learning from sparse annotations. We demonstrate that the SLHSP that learned with less than 10% of annotated trajectories has a comparable performance to one that learned with 100% of annotated data. Our approach to the challenging ALFRED benchmark leads to a notable improvement in the success rate over a strong baseline also optimized for sparsely annotated data.",

        "abstract": "AbstractLand suitability models for Canada are currently based on single-crop inventories and expert opinion. We present a data-driven multi-layer perceptron that simultaneously predicts the land suitability of several crops in Canada, including barley, peas, spring wheat, canola, oats, and soy. Available crop yields from 2013â2020 are downscaled to the farm level by masking the district level crop yield data to focus only on areas where crops are cultivated and leveraging soil-climate-landscape variables obtained from Google Earth Engine for crop yield prediction. This new semi-supervised learning approach can accommodate data from different spatial resolutions and enables training with unlabelled data. The incorporation of a crop indicator function further allows for the training of a multi-crop model that can capture the interdependences and correlations between various crops, thereby leading to more accurate predictions. Through k-fold cross-validation, we show that compared to the single crop models, our multi-crop model could produce up to a 2.82 fold reduction in mean absolute error for any particular crop. We found that barley, oats, and mixed grains were more tolerant to soil-climate-landscape variations and could be grown in many regions of Canada, while non-grain crops were more sensitive to environmental factors. Predicted crop suitability was associated with a regionâs growing season length, which supports climate change projections that regions of northern Canada will become more suitable for agricultural use. The proposed multi-crop model could facilitate assessment of the suitability of northern lands for crop cultivation and be incorporated into cost-benefit analyses.",

        "abstract": "Currently, self-supervised learning has shown effectiveness in solving data labeling issues. Its success mainly depends on having access to large, high-quality datasets with diverse features. It also relies on utilizing the spatial, temporal, and semantic structures present in the data. However, domains such as finance, healthcare, and insurance primarily utilize tabular data formats. This presents challenges for traditional data augmentation methods aimed at improving data quality. Furthermore, the privacy-sensitive nature of these domains complicates the acquisition of the extensive, high-quality datasets necessary for training effective self-supervised models. To tackle these challenges, our proposal introduces a novel framework that combines self-supervised learning with Federated Learning (FL). This approach aims to solve the problem of data-distributed training while ensuring training quality. Our framework improves upon the conventional self-supervised learning data augmentation paradigm by incorporating data labeling through the segmentation of data into subsets. Our framework adds noise by splitting subsets of data and can achieve the same level of centralized learning in a distributed environment. Moreover, we conduct experiments on various public tabular datasets to evaluate our approach. The experimental results showcase the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method in scenarios involving unlabeled data and distributed settings.",

        "abstract": "Human action recognition has drawn significant attention because of its importance in computer vision-based applications. Action recognition based on skeleton sequences has rapidly advanced in the last decade. Conventional deep learning-based approaches are based on extracting skeleton sequences through convolutional operations. Most of these architectures are implemented by learning spatial and temporal features through multiple streams. These studies have enlightened the action recognition endeavor from various algorithmic angles. However, three common issues are observed: (1) The models are usually complicated; therefore, they have a correspondingly higher computational complexity. (2) For supervised learning models, the reliance on labels during training is always a drawback. (3) Implementing large models is not beneficial to real-time applications. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based self-supervised learning framework with a contrastive learning loss function (ConMLP). ConMLP does not require a massive computational setup; it can effectively reduce the consumption of computational resources. Compared with supervised learning frameworks, ConMLP is friendly to the huge amount of unlabeled training data. In addition, it has low requirements for system configuration and is more conducive to being embedded in real-world applications. Extensive experiments show that ConMLP achieves the top one inference result of 96.9% on the NTU RGB+D dataset. This accuracy is higher than the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning method. Meanwhile, ConMLP is also evaluated in a supervised learning manner, which has achieved comparable performance to the state of the art of recognition accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has grown tremendously in recent years. Typically, bilingual, and multilingual translation models have been deployed widely in machine translation and gained vast attention from the research community. On the contrary, few studies have focused on translating between spoken and sign languages, especially non-English languages. Prior works on Sign Language Translation (SLT) have shown that a mid-level sign gloss representation enhances translation performance. Therefore, this study presents a new large-scale Korean sign language dataset, the Museum-Commentary Korean Sign Gloss (MCKSG) dataset, including 3828 pairs of Korean sentences and their corresponding sign glosses used in Museum-Commentary contexts. In addition, we propose a translation framework based on self-supervised learning, where the pretext task is a text-to-text from a Korean sentence to its back-translation versions, then the pre-trained network will be fine-tuned on the MCKSG dataset. Using self-supervised learning help to overcome the drawback of a shortage of sign language data. Through experimental results, our proposed model outperforms a baseline BERT model by 6.22%.",

        "abstract": "Robotic agents trained using reinforcement learning have the problem of taking unreliable actions in an out-of-distribution (OOD) state. Agents can easily become OOD in real-world environments because it is almost impossible for them to visit and learn the entire state space during training. Unfortunately, unreliable actions do not ensure that agents perform their original tasks successfully. Therefore, agents should be able to recognize whether they are in OOD states and learn how to return to the learned state distribution rather than continue to take unreliable actions. In this study, we propose a novel method for retraining agents to recover from OOD situations in a self-supervised manner when they fall into OOD states. Our in-depth experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves the agentâs ability to recover from OOD situations in terms of sample efficiency and restoration of the performance for the original tasks. Moreover, we show that our method can retrain the agent to recover from OOD situations even when in-distribution states are difficult to visit through exploration.

The central idea of this learning technique is based on an auxiliary stage aka pretext task in which labeled data are created automatically through data augmentation and exploited for pretraining the DNN. However, the effect of each pretext task is not well studied or compared in the literature. In this paper, we study the contribution of augmentation operators on the performance of self supervised learning algorithms in a constrained settings. We propose an evolutionary search method for optimization of data augmentation pipeline in pretext tasks and measure the impact of augmentation operators in several SOTA SSL algorithms. By encoding different combination of augmentation operators in chromosomes we seek the optimal augmentation policies through an evolutionary optimization mechanism. We further introduce methods for analyzing and explaining the performance of optimized SSL algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed method can find solutions that outperform the accuracy of classification of SSL algorithms which confirms the influence of augmentation policy choice on the overall performance of SSL algorithms. We also compare optimal SSL solutions found by our evolutionary search mechanism and show the effect of batch size in the pretext task on two visual datasets.",

The advancement of RNA-Seq technology has resulted in a large volume of gene expression data for analysis.\n\nResults\nOur computational model (built on top of TabNet) is first pretrained on an unlabelled dataset of multiple types of adenomas and adenocarcinomas and later fine-tuned on the labelled dataset, showing promising results in the context of the estimation of the vital status of colorectal cancer patients. We achieve a final cross-validated (ROC-AUC) Score of 0.88 by using multiple modalities of data.\n\nConclusion\nThe results of this study demonstrate that self-supervised learning methods pretrained on a vast corpus of unlabelled data outperform traditional supervised learning methods such as XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees that have been prevalent in the tabular domain. The results of this study are further boosted by the inclusion of multiple modalities of data pertaining to the patients in question. We find that genes such as RBM3, GSPT1, MAD2L1, and others important to the computation modelâs prediction task obtained through model interpretability corroborate with pathological evidence in current literature.\n",

        "abstract": "Logs play an important role in anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, and trace checking of software and network systems. Log parsing, which converts each raw log line to a constant template and a variable parameter list, is a prerequisite for system security analysis. Traditional parsing methods utilizing specific rules can only parse logs of specific formats, and most parsing methods based on deep learning require labels. However, the existing parsing methods are not applicable to logs of inconsistent formats and insufficient labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust Log parsing method based on Self-supervised Learning (LogSL), which can extract templates from logs of different formats. The essential idea of LogSL is modeling log parsing as a multi-token prediction task, which makes the multi-token prediction model learn the distribution of tokens belonging to the template in raw log lines by self-supervision mode. Furthermore, to accurately predict the tokens of the template without labeled data, we construct a Multi-token Prediction Model (MPM) combining the pre-trained XLNet module, the n-layer stacked Long Short-Term Memory Net module, and the Self-attention module. We validate LogSL on 12 benchmark log datasets, resulting in the average parsing accuracy of our parser being 3.9% higher than that of the best baseline method. Experimental results show that LogSL has superiority in terms of robustness and accuracy. In addition, a case study of anomaly detection is conducted to demonstrate the support of the proposed MPM to system security tasks based on logs.",

        "abstract": " Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for seismic data interpolation, in which a recovery network is trained over corrupted (input)/complete (label) pairs. However, the trained model always suffers from poor generalization when the target test data are significantly different from the training data sets. To address this issue, we have developed a self-supervised deep learning method for interpolating irregularly missing traces, which uses only the corrupted seismic data for training. This approach is based on the receptive field characteristic of CNNs, and the training pairs are extracted from the corrupted seismic data through a random trace mask. After network training, all target data are recovered using the trained model. This self-supervised learning interpolation (SSLI) method can be easily integrated into commonly used CNNs. Synthetic and field examples demonstrate that SSLI not only significantly outperforms traditional multichannel singular spectrum analysis and unsupervised deep seismic prior methods but also competes with supervised learning methods.

        "abstract": "Despite achieving impressive improvement in accuracy, most existing monocular 3D human mesh reconstruction methods require large-scale 2D/3D ground-truths for supervision, which limits their applications on unlabeled in-the-wild data that is ubiquitous. To alleviate the reliance on 2D/3D ground-truths, we present a self-supervised 3D human pose and shape reconstruction framework that relies only on self-consistency between intermediate representations of images and projected 2D predictions. Specifically, we extract 2D joints and depth maps from monocular images as proxy inputs, which provides complementary clues to infer accurate 3D human meshes. Furthermore, to reduce the impacts from noisy and ambiguous inputs while better concentrate on the high-quality information, we design an uncertainty-aware module to automatically learn the reliability of the inputs at body-joint level based on the consistency between 2D joints and depth map. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods at similar supervision levels.",

        "abstract": "Many new reconstruction techniques have been deployed to allow low-dose CT examinations. Such reconstruction techniques exhibit nonlinear properties, which strengthen the need for a task-based measure of image quality. The Hotelling observer (HO) is the optimal linear observer and provides a lower bound of the Bayesian ideal observer detection performance. However, its computational complexity impedes its widespread practical usage. To address this issue, we proposed a self-supervised learning (SSL)-based model observer to provide accurate estimates of HO performance in very low-dose chest CT images. Our approach involved a two-stage model combining a convolutional denoising auto-encoder (CDAE) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine for classification. To evaluate this approach, we conducted signal detection tasks employing chest CT images with different noise structures generated by computer-based simulations. We compared this approach with two supervised learning-based methods: a single-layer neural network (SLNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The results showed that the CDAE-based model was able to achieve similar detection performance to the HO. In addition, it outperformed both SLNN and CNN when a reduced number of training images was considered. The proposed approach holds promise for optimizing low-dose CT protocols across scanner platforms.",
