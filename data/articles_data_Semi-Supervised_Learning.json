It can be useful for all learning paradigms:\nunsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. In this paper, we present\na graph-based, deep and flexible data representation method using\nfeature propagation as an internal filtering step. The presented\nframework ensures several desired features such as a graph-based\nregularization, a flexible projection model, a graph-based feature\naggregation, and a deep learning architecture. The model can be learned\nlayer by layer. In each layer, the nonlinear data representation and the\nunknown linear model are jointly estimated with a closed form solution.\nWe evaluate the proposed method on semi-supervised classification tasks\nusing six public image datasets. These experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the presented scheme, which compares favorably to many\ncompeting semi-supervised approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nMotivation: Genome-wide association studies have systematically identified thousands of single nucleotide polymor-phisms (SNPs) associated with complex genetic diseases. However, the majority of those SNPs were found in non-coding genomic regions, preventing the understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. Predicting molecular processes based on the DNA sequence represents a promising approach to understand the role of those non-coding SNPs. Over the past years, deep learning was successfully applied to regulatory sequence prediction using supervised learning. Supervised learning required DNA sequences associated with functional data for training, whose amount is strongly limited by the finite size of the human genome. Conversely, the amount of mammalian DNA sequences is exponentially increasing due to ongoing large sequencing projects, but without functional data in most cases. \nResults: To alleviate the limitations of supervised learning, we propose a paradigm shift with semi-supervised learning, which does not only exploit labeled sequences (e.g. human genome with ChIP-seq experiment), but also unlabeled sequences available in much larger amounts (e.g. from other species without ChIP-seq experiment, such as chimpanzee). Our approach is flexible and can be plugged into any neural architecture including shallow and deep networks, and shows strong predictive performance improvements compared to supervised learning in most cases (up to 70%). \nAvailability and implementation: https://forgemia.inra.fr/raphael.mourad/deepgnn",

It works by sending a large volume of fake network traffic from multiple sources in order to consume the network resources. Among various DDoS attacks, TCP SYN flooding attack is one of the most popular DDoS attacks. In this attack, the attacker sends large amounts of half-open TCP connections on the targeted server in order to exhaust its resources and make it unavailable.

This separation makes it easier to the controller to program and manage the entire network from single device to make better decisions than when the control is distributed among all the switches.

Researchers have proposed many solutions to better utilize SDN to detect DDoS attacks, however, it is still a very challenging problem for quick and precise detection of this kind of attacks.

        "abstract": "Dynamic interactions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere give rise to dramatic auroral forms that have been instrumental in the ground-based study of magnetospheric dynamics. The general mechanism of aurora types and their large-scale patterns are well-known, but the morphology of small- to meso-scale auroral forms observed in all-sky imagers and their relation to magnetospheric dynamics&#160; and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the upper atmosphere remain in question. Machine learning has the potential to provide answers to these questions, but most existing auroral image data lack the ground-truth labels required for supervised learning and conventional statistical analyses. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised semi-supervised algorithm to automatically label the THEMIS all-sky image database. Specifically, we adapt the self-supervised Simple framework for Contrastive Learning of Representations (SimCLR) algorithm to learn latent representations of THEMIS all-sky images. These representations are finetuned using a small set of manually labeled data from the Oslo Aurora THEMIS (OATH) dataset, after which semi-supervised classification is used to train a classifier, beginning by training on the manually labeled OATH dataset and gradually incorporating the classifier&#8217;s most confident predictions on unlabeled data into the training dataset as ground-truth. We demonstrate that (a) classifiers fit to the learned representations of the manually labeled images achieve state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art performance, improving the classification accuracy by almost 10% over the current benchmark on labeled data; and (b) our model&#8217;s learned representations naturally cluster into more clusters than manually assigned categories, suggesting that existing categorizations are coarse and may obscure important connections between auroral types and their drivers. Finally, we introduce AuroraClick, a citizen science project with the goal of manually annotating a large representative sample of THEMIS all-sky images for the validation of our current models and the training of future models.&#160;&#160;",

        "abstract": "AbstractAccess to large-scale genomics datasets has increased the utility of hypothesis-free genome-wide analyses that result in candidate lists of genes. Often these analyses highlight several gene signals that might contribute to pathogenesis but are insufficiently powered to reach experiment-wide significance. This often triggers a process of laborious evaluation of highly-ranked genes through manual inspection of various public knowledge resources to triage those considered sufficiently interesting for deeper investigation. Here, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional, multi-step machine learning framework to objectively and more holistically assess biological relevance of genes to disease studies, by relying on a plethora of gene-associated annotations. We developed mantis-ml to serve as an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework, following a stochastic semi-supervised learning approach to rank known and novel disease-associated genes through iterative training and prediction sessions of random balanced datasets across the protein-coding exome (n=18,626 genes). We applied this framework on a range of disease-specific areas and as a generic disease likelihood estimator, achieving an average Area Under Curve (AUC) prediction performance of 0.85. Critically, to demonstrate applied utility on exome-wide association studies, we overlapped mantis-ml disease-specific predictions with data from published cohort-level association studies. We retrieved statistically significant enrichment of high mantis-ml predictions among the top-ranked genes from hypothesis-free cohort-level statistics (p<0.05), suggesting the capture of true prioritisation signals. We believe that mantis-ml is a novel easy-to-use tool to support objectively triaging gene discovery and overall enhancing our understanding of complex genotype-phenotype associations.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGenome-wide association studies have systematically identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex genetic diseases. However, the majority of those SNPs were found in non-coding genomic regions, preventing the understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. Predicting molecular processes based on the DNA sequence represents a promising approach to understand the role of those non-coding SNPs. Over the past years, deep learning was successfully applied to regulatory sequence prediction. Such method required DNA sequences associated with functional data for training. However, the human genome has a finite size which strongly limits the amount of DNA sequence with functional data available for training. Conversely, the amount of mammalian DNA sequences is exponentially increasing due to ongoing large sequencing projects, but without functional data in most cases. Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on graph neural network which allows to borrow information from homologous mammal sequences during training. Our approach can be plugged into any existing deep learning model and showed improvements in many different situations, including classification and regression, and for different types of functional data.",

        "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of semi-supervised learning when the set of labeled samples is limited to a small number of images per class, typically less than 10, problem that we refer to as barely-supervised learning. We analyze in depth the behavior of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised method, FixMatch, which relies on a weakly-augmented version of an image to obtain supervision signal for a more strongly-augmented version. We show that it frequently fails in barely-supervised scenarios, due to a lack of training signal when no pseudo-label can be predicted with high confidence. We propose a method to leverage self-supervised methods that provides training signal in the absence of confident pseudo-labels. We then propose two methods to refine the pseudo-label selection process which lead to further improvements.The first one relies on a per-sample history of the model predictions, akin to a voting scheme. The second iteratively up-dates class-dependent confidence thresholds to better explore classes that are under-represented in the pseudo-labels. Our experiments show that our approach performs significantly better on STL-10 in the barely-supervised regime,e.g. with 4 or 8 labeled images per class.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Optimal treatment for cancer patients relies on accurate pathological diagnosis. The world health organization has defined almost 100 known central nervous system (CNS) tumors, making the histopathological diagnostic process particularly challenging. To help reduce variability, validation costs, and standardize the histopathological diagnostic process, supervised machine learning techniques using epigenetic data have been developed. These methods require large labeled training data sets to obtain clinically acceptable classification accuracy. However, labeling pathology data for machine learning models is time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for rare tumor types. On the other hand, there is now abundance of unlabeled epigenetic data across multiple databases. To maximize the utility of both labeled and unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach has been proposed and shown to be effective in genomic field. However, it has not yet been explored with epigenetic data nor demonstrated beneficial to CNS tumor classification.Results: This paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning on methylation data to improve accuracy of supervised learning models in classifying CNS tumors. We comprehensively evaluated 11 SSL methods and developed a novel combination approach including a self-training with editing using support vector machine (SETRED-SVM) as the base learner model with an L2-penalized, multinomial logistic regression model to obtain high confidence labels from a small labeled instances. Results across 8 differently trained random forest and neural net models show that SETRED-SVM followed with multinomial logistic regression approach is able to produce high confidence training data set, leading to a statiscally significant increase in prediction accuracy of 82 CNS tumors.Conclusions: The proposed combination of semi-supervised technique and multinomial logistic regression holds the potential to leverage the abundant publically available unlabeled methylation data effectively. Such an approach is highly beneficial in providing additional training examples, especially for scarce tumor types, to boost the prediction accuracy of supervised models.",

        "abstract": "Ice crystals play a crucial role in precipitation formation and radiation budget, with their various shapes influencing these processes differently. The shape of ice crystals is related to the environmental conditions (i.e. temperature) under which the ice crystal forms and the microphysical processes that ice crystal experiences. Therefore, ice crystal shape classification is important for understanding conditions and microphysical processes in cloud. However, current methods are mainly supervised learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), heavily relying on extensive manual labelling, which requires substantial labor. Moreover, the limitations in human&#8217;s knowledge of ice crystals and the bias of human subjectivity in classification hinder the generalization ability of these networks. In response to these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm for ice crystal classification. We use data from the 2019 Ny-&#197;lesund NASCENT campaign, collected by a holographic imager mounted on the balloon-borne platform HoloBalloon, which includes 18,864 ice crystal images. In our algorithm we initially extract key features from ice crystal images using an unsupervised learning network, prioritizing generalization rather than dependence on labelled data, which ensures unbiased feature identification. Subsequently, a small subset of images is manually labelled into nineteen categories based on a multi-label classification scheme that consider both basic habits and microphysical processes. The classification accuracy of our hybrid algorithm on nineteen categories is similar to the performance supervised learning algorithm. This hybrid algorithm not only reduces the labor needed for manual labelling but also incorporates physics-based constraints, which prevents the network from making unfounded assumptions, thus offering a robust and efficient framework for ice crystal classification.",

        "abstract": "Clouds are classified into types, classes, or regimes. The World Meteorological Organization distinguishes stratus and cumulus clouds and three altitude layers. Cloud types exhibit very different radiative properties and interact in numerous ways with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. However, it has proven difficult to define cloud regimes objectively and from remote sensing data, hindering the understanding we have of the processes and adjustments involved.Building on the method we previously developed, we combine synoptic observations and passive satellite remote-sensing retrievals to constitute a database of cloud types and cloud properties to eventually train a cloud classification algorithm. The cloud type labels come from the global marine meteorological observations dataset (UK Met Office, 2006) which is comprised of near-global synoptic observations. This data record reports back information about cloud type and other meteorological quantities at the surface. The cloud classification model is built on different cloud-top and cloud optical properties (Level 2 products MOD06/MYD06 from the MODIS sensor) extracted temporally close to the observation time and on a 128km x 128km grid around the synoptic observation location. To make full use of the large quantity of remote sensing data available and to investigate the variety in cloud settings, a convolutional variational auto-encoder (VAE) is applied as a dimensionality reduction tool in a first step. Furthermore, such model architecture allows to account for spatial relationships while describing non-linear patterns in the input data. The cloud classification task is subsequently performed drawing on the constructed latent representation of the VAE. Associating information from underneath and above the cloud enables to build a robust model to classify cloud types. For the training we specify a study domain in the Atlantic ocean around the equator and evaluate the method globally. Further experiments and evaluation are done on simulation data produced by the ICON model.",

        "abstract": "AbstractMelanoma is one of the most fatal forms of skin cancer and is often very difficult to differentiate from other benign skin lesions. However, if detected at its early stages, it can almost always be cured. Researchers and data scientists have studied this disease in-depth with the help of large datasets containing high-quality dermascopic images, such as those assembled by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). However, these images often lack diversity and over-represent patients with very common skin features such as light skin and having no visible body hair. In this study, we introduce a novel architecture called LatentNet which automatically detects over-represented features and reduces their weights during training. We tested our model on four distinct categories - three skin color levels corresponding to Type I, II, and III on the Fitzpatrick Scale, and images containing visible hair. We then compared the accuracy against the conventional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model trained using the standard approach (i.e. without detecting over-represented features) and containing the same hyper-parameters as the LatentNet. LatentNet showed significant performance improvement over the standard DCNN model with accuracy of 89.52%, 79.05%, 64.31%, and 64.35% compared to the DCNN accuracy of 90.41%, 70.82%, 45.28%, 56.52% in the corresponding categories, respectively. Differences in the average performance between the models were statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting that the proposed model successfully reduced bias amongst the tested categories. LatentNet is the first architecture that addresses racial bias (and other sources of bias) in deep-learning based Melanoma diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nDocument Layout Analysis (DLA) is the process of automatically identifying and categorizing the structural components (e.g. Text, Figure, Table, etc.) within a document to extract meaningful content and establish the page's layout structure. It is a crucial stage in document parsing, contributing to their comprehension. However, traditional DLA approaches often demand a significant volume of labeled training data, and the labor-intensive task of generating high-quality annotated training data poses a substantial challenge. In order to address this challenge, we proposed a semi-supervised setting that aims to perform learning on limited annotated categories by eliminating exhaustive and expensive mask annotations. The proposed setting is expected to be generalizable to novel categories as it learns the underlying positional information through a support set and class information through Co-Occurrence that can be generalized from annotated categories to novel categories. Here, we first extract features from the input image and support set with a shared multi-scale feature acquisition backbone. Then, the extracted feature representation is fed to the transformer encoder as a query. Later on, we utilize a semantic embedding network before the decoder to capture the underlying semantic relationships and similarities between different instances, enabling the model to make accurate predictions or classifications with only a limited amount of labeled data. Extensive experimentation on competitive benchmarks like PRIMA, DocLayNet, and Historical Japanese (HJ) demonstrate that this generalized setup obtains significant performance compared to the conventional supervised approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nIn an effort to identify cyber-attacks on infill structures, detection systems based on supervised learning have been attempted in Additive Manufacturing (AM) security investigations. However, supervised learning requires a myriad of training data sets to achieve acceptable detection accuracy. Besides, since it is impossible to train for unprecedented defective types, the detection systems cannot guarantee robustness against unforeseen attacks.\nTo overcome such disadvantages of supervised learning, This paper presents infill defective detection system (IDDS) augmented by semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning allows classifying a sheer volume of unlabeled data sets by training a comparably small number of labeled data sets. Additionally, IDDS exploits self-training to increase the robustness against various defective types that are not pre-trained.\nIDDS consists of the feature extraction, pre-training, self-training. To validate the usefulness of IDDS, five defective types were designed and tested with IDDS, which was trained by only normal labeled data sets. The results are compared with the basis accuracy from the perceptron network model with supervised learning.",
