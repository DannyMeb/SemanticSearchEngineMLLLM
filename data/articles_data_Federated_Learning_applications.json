        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next big technological revolution in recent years with the potential to transform every sphere of human life. As devices, applications, and communication networks become increasingly connected and integrated, security and privacy concerns in IoT are growing at an alarming rate as well. While existing research has largely focused on centralized systems to detect security attacks, these systems do not scale well with the rapid growth of IoT devices and pose a single-point of failure risk. Furthermore, since data is extensively dispersed across huge networks of connected devices, decentralized computing is critical. Federated learning (FL) systems in the recent times has gained popularity as the distributed machine learning model that enables IoT edge devices to collaboratively train models in a decentralized manner while ensuring that data on a user’s device stays private without the contents or details of that data ever leaving that device. In this paper, we propose a federated learning based intrusion detection system using LSTM Autoencoder. The proposed technique allows IoT devices to train a global model without revealing their private data, enabling the training model to grow in size while protecting each participants local data. We conduct extensive experiments using the BoT-IoT data set and demonstrate that our solution can not only effectively improve IoT security against unknown attacks but also ensure users data privacy.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed alternative to traditional machine learning frameworks that computes a global model on a centralized aggregation server according to the parameters of local models, which can address the privacy leakage problem caused by collecting sensitive data from local devices. However, the classic FL methods with synchronous aggregation strategies, in many cases, shall suffer from limitations in resource utilization due to the need to wait for slower devices (stragglers) to aggregate during each training epoch. In addition, the accuracy of the global model can be affected by the uneven distribution of data among unreliable devices in real-world scenarios. Therefore, many Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) methods have been developed on many occasions to improve communication efficiency, model performance, privacy, and security. This article elaborates on the existing research on AFL and its applications in many areas. The paper first introduces the concept and development of FL, and then discusses in detail the related work and main research directions of AFL, including dealing with stragglers, staleness, communication efficiency between devices, and privacy and scalability issues. Then, this paper also explores the application of AFL in different fields, especially in the fields of mobile device edge computing, Internet of Things devices, and medical data analysis. Finally, the article gives some outlook on future research directions and believes that it is necessary to design efficient asynchronous optimization algorithms, reduce communication overhead and computing resource usage, and explore new data privacy protection methods.",

        "abstract": "Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FSSL) combines techniques from both fields of federated and semi- supervised learning to improve the accuracy and performance of models in a distributed environment by using a small fraction of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Without the need tocentralize all data in one place for training, it collect updates of model training after devices train models at local, and thus can protect the privacy of user data. However, during the federal training process, some of the devices fail to collect enough data for local training, while new devices will be included to the group training. This leads to an unbalanced global data distribution and thus af ect the performance of the global model training. Most of the current research is focusing on class imbalance with a fixednumber of classes, while little attention is paid to data imbalance with a variable number of classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Federated Semi-supervised Learning for Class Variable Imbalance (FCVI) to solve class variable imbalance. The class-variable learning algorithm is used to mitigate the data imbalance due to changes of the number of classes. Our scheme is proved to be significantly better than baseline methods, while maintaining client privacy.",

        "abstract": "\n            The increasing concern for privacy and the use of machine learning on personal data has led researchers to introduce new approaches to machine learning.\n            Federated learning\n            is one such a novel privacy-preserving machine learning approach that “brings code to data,” unlike traditional machine learning approaches that “bring data to code.” In addition to improving privacy, federated learning is beneficial for latency-sensitive mobility applications by providing local models. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first ever to survey mobility-related federated learning solutions, such as traffic-flow prediction, next-location prediction, and point-of-interest recommendation. Our categorization is based on three main questions:\n            Why use federated learning?\n            to identify the motivation to use federated learning;\n            What problems are being addressed?\n            to examine problems that surface with federated learning and how they are solved; and\n            How is federated learning implemented?\n            to account for the solutions implemented by the authors surveyed The selected papers are peer reviewed and published in journals and conferences; they all adopt federated learning as their core approach. We introduce our conceptual model to characterize federated learning solutions and to compare them. In our conceptual model, we define three abstract roles: data generator, learner, and aggregator. We also explain how the work in the selected papers fits into our conceptual model.\n          ",

        "abstract": "Since its introduction in 2016, researchers have applied the idea of Federated Learning (FL) to several domains ranging from edge computing to banking. The technique’s inherent security benefits, privacy-preserving capabilities, ease of scalability, and ability to transcend data biases have motivated researchers to use this tool on healthcare datasets. While several reviews exist detailing FL and its applications, this review focuses solely on the different applications of FL to medical imaging datasets, grouping applications by diseases, modality, and/or part of the body. This Systematic Literature review was conducted by querying and consolidating results from ArXiv, IEEE Xplorer, and PubMed. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of FL architecture, models, descriptions of the performance achieved by FL models, and how results compare with traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Additionally, we discuss the security benefits, highlighting two primary forms of privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Finally, we provide some background information and context regarding where the contributions lie. The background information is organized into the following categories: architecture/setup type, data-related topics, security, and learning types. While progress has been made within the field of FL and medical imaging, much room for improvement and understanding remains, with an emphasis on security and data issues remaining the primary concerns for researchers. Therefore, improvements are constantly pushing the field forward. Finally, we highlighted the challenges in deploying FL in medical imaging applications and provided recommendations for future directions.",

Federated Learning has emerged as a promising solution, enabling multiple nodes to collectively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. This research proposes SentinelNet, a novel Federated Learning framework specifically designed for collaborative network security. The framework emphasizes secure threat intelligence sharing, privacy-preserving techniques, and adaptive learning mechanisms. Through comprehensive evaluations and real-world case studies, SentinelNet demonstrates its efficacy in enhancing network security while maintaining data confidentiality. The research highlights the significance of collaborative approaches and advocates the adoption of Federated Learning to fortify decentralized network ecosystems.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn the context of federated learning, this paper focuses on managing inherent dynamics and uncertainties, and optimizing energy management for devices in real‐world industrial environments. The problem is formulated by proposing an online deep reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes model iteration updates between clients and servers, and an energy harvesting strategy that enhances device performance and extends lifespan. Through these innovative methods, solutions are provided for the dynamics and uncertainties in federated learning and a new approach is devised for energy usage optimization and task scheduling. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in transitioning federated learning from theory to practical application, and offering diversified application scenarios. In summary, this research contributes to the development of federated learning by providing novel insights and methodologies, and highlights the challenges and opportunities for future studies in the field.",

        "abstract": "The internet of things (IoT) represents a disruptive concept that has been changing society in several ways. There have been several successful applications of IoT in the industry. For example, in transportation systems, the novel internet of vehicles (IoV) concept has enabled new research directions and automation solutions. Moreover, reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), and federated reinforcement learning (FRL) have demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex problems in different applications. In recent years, new solutions have been developed based on this combined framework (i.e., federated reinforcement learning). Conversely, there is a lack of analysis concerning IoT applications and a standard view of challenges and future directions of the current FRL landscape. Thereupon, the main goal of this research is to present a literature review of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) applications in IoT from multiple perspectives. We focus on analyzing applications in multiple areas (e.g., security, sustainability and efficiency, vehicular solutions, and industrial services) to highlight existing solutions, their characteristics, and research gaps. Additionally, we identify key short- and long-term challenges leading to new opportunities in the field. This research intends to picture the current FRL ecosystem in IoT to foster the development of new solutions based on existing challenges.",

        "abstract": "In the contemporary landscape, machine learning has a pervasive impact across virtually all industries. However, the success of these systems hinges on the accessibility of training data. In today's world, every device generates data, which can serve as the building blocks for future technologies. Conventional machine learning methods rely on centralized data for training, but the availability of sufficient and valid data is often hindered by privacy concerns. Data privacy is the main concern while developing a healthcare system. One of the technique which allow decentralized learning is Federated Learning. Researchers have been actively applying this approach in various domains and have received a positive response. This paper underscores the significance of employing Federated Learning in the healthcare sector, emphasizing the wealth of data present in hospitals and electronic health records that could be used to train medical systems.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has recently attracted considerable attention. However, training medical AI models is challenging due to privacy-protection regulations. Among the proposed solutions, federated learning (FL) stands out. FL involves transmitting only model parameters without sharing the original data, making it particularly suitable for the medical field, where data privacy is paramount. This study reviews the application of FL in the medical domain.Methods: We conducted a literature search using the keywords \"federated learning\" in combination with \"medical,\" \"healthcare,\" or \"clinical\" on Google Scholar and PubMed. After reviewing titles and abstracts, 58 papers were selected for analysis. These FL studies were categorized based on the types of data used, the target disease, the use of open datasets, the local model of FL, and the neural network model. We also examined issues related to heterogeneity and security.Results: In the investigated FL studies, the most commonly used data type was image data, and the most studied target diseases were cancer and COVID-19. The majority of studies utilized open datasets. Furthermore, 72% of the FL articles addressed heterogeneity issues, while 50% discussed security concerns.Conclusions: FL in the medical domain appears to be in its early stages, with most research using open data and focusing on specific data types and diseases for performance verification purposes. Nonetheless, medical FL research is anticipated to be increasingly applied and to become a vital component of multi-institutional research.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have rapidly gained popularity due to their widely employed applications in various industries and fields, including search and rescue, agriculture, industry, military operations, safety, and more. Additionally, drones assist with tasks such as search and rescue efforts, pandemic virus containment, crisis management, and other critical operations. Due to their unique capabilities in image, video, and information collection, a multi-UAV system plays a crucial role in these activities. However, such images and video data involve individual privacy. Therefore, such multi-UAV applications have an indigenous tradeoff of privacy preservation. We have proposed a Federated Learning (FL) based approach for ensuring privacy in multi-UAV applications. The proposed methodology utilizes a synchronous FL approach and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to ensure security. The model parameters are protected by using a secure aggregation. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques in terms of accuracy and precision.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers the possibility of collaboration between multiple devices while maintaining data confidentiality, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Though FL can keep local data private, it may encounter problems when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), insufficient local training samples or cyber-attacks. This paper introduces algorithms that can provide a reliable aggregation of the global model by investigating the accuracy of models received from clients. This allows reducing the influence of less confident nodes, who were potentially attacked or unable to perform successful training. The analysis includes the proposed FedAcc and FedAccSize algorithms, together with their new extension based on the Lasso regression, FedLasso. FedAcc and FedAccSize set the confidence in each client based only on local models’ accuracy, while FedLasso exploits additional details related to predictions, like predicted class probabilities, to support a refined aggregation. The ability of the proposed algorithms to protect against intruders or underperforming clients is demonstrated experimentally using testing scenarios involving independent and identically distributed (IID) data as well as non-IID data. The comparison with the established FedAvg and FedAvgM algorithms shows that exploiting the quality of the client models is essential for reliable aggregation, which enables rapid and robust improvement in the global model.",

        "abstract": "This research explores neural network models' performance and adaptability in the context of the colorectal histology dataset as it pertains to the categorization of textures. Inception, VGG19, and MobileNet, together with their federated variations, are among the models being examined. The study includes a detailed evaluation, parameter analysis, and training information. VGG19 stands out as a particularly noteworthy high performance, with remarkable accuracy, precision, and recall. Due to its lightweight design, MobileNet performs less well, but its potential is enhanced by the addition of federated learning. The accuracy and precision of federated versions of Inception, VGG19, MobileNet, and a Lightweight MobileNet model are competitive, with FL-Lightweight MobileNet achieving outstanding results. The work has important ramifications for the field of medical image analysis since it shows how federated learning may balance the need for data confidentiality and privacy with model performance. This study marks a turning point in the development of medical imaging by opening the door to in-depth investigation into the complex interactions across federated paradigms. Furthermore, these results provide a compelling story in the wider discussion of how cutting-edge technologies and the pressing needs of contemporary healthcare might work together.",

        "abstract": "Conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning approaches require sharing customers’ sensitive information with an external credit bureau to generate a prediction model, thereby increasing the risk of privacy leakage. This poses a significant challenge for financial companies. To address this challenge, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach to protect data privacy. However, the high communication costs associated with federated systems, particularly for large neural networks, can be a bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, it is necessary to limit the number and size of communications for practical training of large neural structures. Gradient sparsification is a technique that has gained increasing attention as a method to reduce communication costs, as it updates only significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure aggregation framework cannot directly employ gradient sparsification. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes two sparsification methods for reducing the communication costs of federated learning. The first method is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model parameter updates, which addresses the challenge of maintaining model accuracy after a high sparsity ratio. This method can significantly reduce the cost of a single communication. The second method is to apply sparsification to the secure aggregation framework. Specifically, the encryption mask matrix is sparsified to reduce communication costs while protecting privacy. Experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce the upload communication costs to approximately 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated learning algorithm under different non-IID experiment settings when the sparsity rate is 0.01.",

The suggested solution detects and mitigates data poisoning attacks using deep learning and CNN architecture, specifically VGG16. In a federated learning architecture with ten healthcare institutions, the approach ensures collaborative model training while protecting sensitive medical data. Data is meticulously prepared and preprocessed using the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset. The federated learning approach uses VGG16's powerful feature extraction to classify skin cancer. A robust strategy for spotting data poisoning threats in federated learning is presented in the study. Outlier detection techniques and strict criteria flag andevaluate problematic model modifications. Performance evaluation proves the model's accuracy, privacy, and datapoisoning resilience.

        "abstract": "\nBackground\nThe proliferation of mobile health (mHealth) applications is partly driven by the advancements in sensing and communication technologies, as well as the integration of artificial intelligence techniques. Data collected from mHealth applications, for example, on sensor devices carried by patients, can be mined and analyzed using artificial intelligence–based solutions to facilitate remote and (near) real-time decision-making in health care settings. However, such data often sit in data silos, and patients are often concerned about the privacy implications of sharing their raw data. Federated learning (FL) is a potential solution, as it allows multiple data owners to collaboratively train a machine learning model without requiring access to each other’s raw data.\n\n\nObjective\nThe goal of this scoping review is to gain an understanding of FL and its potential in dealing with sensitive and heterogeneous data in mHealth applications. Through this review, various stakeholders, such as health care providers, practitioners, and policy makers, can gain insight into the limitations and challenges associated with using FL in mHealth and make informed decisions when considering implementing FL-based solutions.\n\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews). We searched 7 commonly used databases. The included studies were analyzed and summarized to identify the possible real-world applications and associated challenges of using FL in mHealth settings.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 1095 articles were retrieved during the database search, and 26 articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The analysis of these articles revealed 2 main application areas for FL in mHealth, that is, remote monitoring and diagnostic and treatment support. More specifically, FL was found to be commonly used for monitoring self-care ability, health status, and disease progression, as well as in diagnosis and treatment support of diseases. The review also identified several challenges (eg, expensive communication, statistical heterogeneity, and system heterogeneity) and potential solutions (eg, compression schemes, model personalization, and active sampling).\n\n\nConclusions\nThis scoping review has highlighted the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving approach in mHealth applications and identified the technical limitations associated with its use. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this review can inform the research agenda for future studies in this field, to overcome these limitations and further advance the use of FL in mHealth.\n",

        "abstract": "With the increasing importance of data sharing for collaboration and innovation, it is becoming more important to ensure that data is managed and shared in a secure and trustworthy manner. Data governance is a common approach to managing data, but it faces many challenges such as data silos, data consistency, privacy, security, and access control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates data trust in federated learning with Inter Planetary File System, block chain, and smart contracts to facilitate secure and mutually beneficial data sharing while providing incentives, access control mechanisms, and penalizing any dishonest behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in improving the accuracy of federated learning models while ensuring the security and fairness of the data-sharing process. The research paper also presents a decentralized federated learning platform that successfully trained a CNN model on the MNIST dataset using block chain technology. The platform enables multiple workers to train the model simultaneously while maintaining data privacy and security. The decentralized architecture and use of block chain technology allow for efficient communication and coordination between workers. This platform has the potential to facilitate decentralized machine learning and support privacy preserving collaboration in various domains.",

        "abstract": "In traditional machine learning, it is trivial to conduct model evaluation since all data samples are managed centrally by a server. However, model evaluation becomes a challenging problem in federated learning (FL), which is called federated evaluation in this work. This is because clients do not expose their original data to preserve data privacy. Federated evaluation plays a vital role in client selection, incentive mechanism design, malicious attack detection, etc. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive survey of existing federated evaluation methods. Moreover, we explore various applications of federated evaluation for enhancing FL performance and finally present future research directions by envisioning some challenges.",
