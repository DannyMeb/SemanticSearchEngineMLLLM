        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next big technological revolution in recent years with the potential to transform every sphere of human life. As devices, applications, and communication networks become increasingly connected and integrated, security and privacy concerns in IoT are growing at an alarming rate as well. While existing research has largely focused on centralized systems to detect security attacks, these systems do not scale well with the rapid growth of IoT devices and pose a single-point of failure risk. Furthermore, since data is extensively dispersed across huge networks of connected devices, decentralized computing is critical. Federated learning (FL) systems in the recent times has gained popularity as the distributed machine learning model that enables IoT edge devices to collaboratively train models in a decentralized manner while ensuring that data on a user’s device stays private without the contents or details of that data ever leaving that device. In this paper, we propose a federated learning based intrusion detection system using LSTM Autoencoder. The proposed technique allows IoT devices to train a global model without revealing their private data, enabling the training model to grow in size while protecting each participants local data. We conduct extensive experiments using the BoT-IoT data set and demonstrate that our solution can not only effectively improve IoT security against unknown attacks but also ensure users data privacy.",

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed alternative to traditional machine learning frameworks that computes a global model on a centralized aggregation server according to the parameters of local models, which can address the privacy leakage problem caused by collecting sensitive data from local devices. However, the classic FL methods with synchronous aggregation strategies, in many cases, shall suffer from limitations in resource utilization due to the need to wait for slower devices (stragglers) to aggregate during each training epoch. In addition, the accuracy of the global model can be affected by the uneven distribution of data among unreliable devices in real-world scenarios. Therefore, many Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) methods have been developed on many occasions to improve communication efficiency, model performance, privacy, and security. This article elaborates on the existing research on AFL and its applications in many areas. The paper first introduces the concept and development of FL, and then discusses in detail the related work and main research directions of AFL, including dealing with stragglers, staleness, communication efficiency between devices, and privacy and scalability issues. Then, this paper also explores the application of AFL in different fields, especially in the fields of mobile device edge computing, Internet of Things devices, and medical data analysis. Finally, the article gives some outlook on future research directions and believes that it is necessary to design efficient asynchronous optimization algorithms, reduce communication overhead and computing resource usage, and explore new data privacy protection methods.",

        "abstract": "Federated Semi-supervised Learning (FSSL) combines techniques from both fields of federated and semi- supervised learning to improve the accuracy and performance of models in a distributed environment by using a small fraction of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Without the need tocentralize all data in one place for training, it collect updates of model training after devices train models at local, and thus can protect the privacy of user data. However, during the federal training process, some of the devices fail to collect enough data for local training, while new devices will be included to the group training. This leads to an unbalanced global data distribution and thus af ect the performance of the global model training. Most of the current research is focusing on class imbalance with a fixednumber of classes, while little attention is paid to data imbalance with a variable number of classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Federated Semi-supervised Learning for Class Variable Imbalance (FCVI) to solve class variable imbalance. The class-variable learning algorithm is used to mitigate the data imbalance due to changes of the number of classes. Our scheme is proved to be significantly better than baseline methods, while maintaining client privacy.",

        "abstract": "\n            The increasing concern for privacy and the use of machine learning on personal data has led researchers to introduce new approaches to machine learning.\n            Federated learning\n            is one such a novel privacy-preserving machine learning approach that “brings code to data,” unlike traditional machine learning approaches that “bring data to code.” In addition to improving privacy, federated learning is beneficial for latency-sensitive mobility applications by providing local models. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first ever to survey mobility-related federated learning solutions, such as traffic-flow prediction, next-location prediction, and point-of-interest recommendation. Our categorization is based on three main questions:\n            Why use federated learning?\n            to identify the motivation to use federated learning;\n            What problems are being addressed?\n            to examine problems that surface with federated learning and how they are solved; and\n            How is federated learning implemented?\n            to account for the solutions implemented by the authors surveyed The selected papers are peer reviewed and published in journals and conferences; they all adopt federated learning as their core approach. We introduce our conceptual model to characterize federated learning solutions and to compare them. In our conceptual model, we define three abstract roles: data generator, learner, and aggregator. We also explain how the work in the selected papers fits into our conceptual model.\n          ",

        "abstract": "Since its introduction in 2016, researchers have applied the idea of Federated Learning (FL) to several domains ranging from edge computing to banking. The technique’s inherent security benefits, privacy-preserving capabilities, ease of scalability, and ability to transcend data biases have motivated researchers to use this tool on healthcare datasets. While several reviews exist detailing FL and its applications, this review focuses solely on the different applications of FL to medical imaging datasets, grouping applications by diseases, modality, and/or part of the body. This Systematic Literature review was conducted by querying and consolidating results from ArXiv, IEEE Xplorer, and PubMed. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of FL architecture, models, descriptions of the performance achieved by FL models, and how results compare with traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Additionally, we discuss the security benefits, highlighting two primary forms of privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Finally, we provide some background information and context regarding where the contributions lie. The background information is organized into the following categories: architecture/setup type, data-related topics, security, and learning types. While progress has been made within the field of FL and medical imaging, much room for improvement and understanding remains, with an emphasis on security and data issues remaining the primary concerns for researchers. Therefore, improvements are constantly pushing the field forward. Finally, we highlighted the challenges in deploying FL in medical imaging applications and provided recommendations for future directions.",

        "abstract": "In decentralized network environments, collaborative efforts are crucial to bolstering network security against everevolving threats from malicious actors. Federated Learning has emerged as a promising solution, enabling multiple nodes to collectively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. This research proposes SentinelNet, a novel Federated Learning framework specifically designed for collaborative network security. The framework emphasizes secure threat intelligence sharing, privacy-preserving techniques, and adaptive learning mechanisms. Through comprehensive evaluations and real-world case studies, SentinelNet demonstrates its efficacy in enhancing network security while maintaining data confidentiality. The research highlights the significance of collaborative approaches and advocates the adoption of Federated Learning to fortify decentralized network ecosystems.",
