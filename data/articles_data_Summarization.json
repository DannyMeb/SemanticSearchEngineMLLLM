        "abstract": "Developing technologies and techniques have increased the amount of information and enabled easier access to information resources. However, due to the ever-growing amount of information sources, it has become difficult to access the information needed in a limited time. Consequently, the need for summary information has become important. This research is focused on the extraction of inferential written summaries of communications that occur in oral environments such as meetings, lectures and conferences. However, since this type of problem requires conversion from audio to text, it also includes issues such as the human factor, sound recording environments, and language-specific problems. This study aimed to take the audio recordings of the meetings, especially the IT sector, to process and summarize. Spontaneous conversations were converted into audio recordings and the obtained texts were summarized using extractive summarization techniques. The motivation of the study is to catch the important points that may escape the attention of the individuals at the meeting and to summarize the main agenda items for the personnel who could not attend the meeting. The experimentally generated dataset (converted from audio recordings to text) was summarized by three different human summarizers and compared with the summaries obtained from the developed inferential summative model. The results obtained are remarkable and it is seen that approximately 71% success was achieved.",

NER will separate different entities according to the project. NER is the process of two steps. The steps are detection of names and classifications of them. The first step is further divided into the segmentation. The second step will consist to choose an ontology which will organize the things categorically. Document summarization is also called automatic summarization. It is a process in which the text document with the help of software will create a summary by selecting the important points of the original text. In this chapter, the authors explain how document summarization is performed using named entity recognition. They discuss about the different types of summarization techniques. They also discuss about how NER works and its applications. The libraries available for NER-based information extraction are explained. They finally explain how NER is applied into document summarization. ",

        "abstract": "With the immense increase of the number of users of the internet and simultaneously the massive expansion of the e-commerce platform, millions of products are sold online. To improve user experience and satisfaction, online shopping platform enables every user to give their reviews for each and every product that they buy online. Reviews are long and contain only a few sentences which are related to a particular feature of that product. It becomes very difficult for the user to understand other customer views about different features of the product. So, we need accurate opinion-based review summarization which will help both customers and product manufacture to understand and focus on a particular aspect of the product. In this chapter, the authors discuss the abstractive document summarization method to summarize e-commerce product reviews. This chapter has an in-depth explanation about different types of document summarization and how that can be applied to e-commerce product reviews. ",

        "abstract": "With the massive expansion of videos on the internet, searching through millions of them has become quite challenging. Smartphones, recording devices, and file sharing are all examples of ways to capture massive amounts of real time video. In smart cities, there are many surveillance cameras, which has created a massive volume of video data whose indexing, retrieval, and administration is a difficult problem. Exploring such results takes time and degrades the user experience. In this case, video summarization is extremely useful. Video summarization allows for the efficient storing, retrieval, and browsing of huge amounts of information from video without sacrificing key features. This article presents a classification and analysis of video summarization approaches, with a focus on real-time video summarization (RVS) domain techniques that can be used to summarize videos. The current study will be useful in integrating essential research findings and data for quick reference, laying the preliminaries, and investigating prospective research directions. A variety of practical uses, including aberrant detection in a video surveillance system, have made successful use of video summarization in smart cities.",

First, they analyze the needs of scientific information services and intelligence analysis on massive scientific and technical literature. Second, terminology recognition and relation extraction are important tasks of knowledge extraction. Third, they study knowledge extraction based on terminology recognition and relation extraction. Fourth, based on terminology and relational network, they study the text summarization techniques and applications. Last, they give comments on current research and applications on text summarization and give their viewpoints for the possible research directions in the future. ",

        "abstract": "On Twitter, the short nature of the post forces users to remain concise while conveying the main ideas to other users. Hence, the challenge is on how to use the unstructured texts to extract information that can be valuable for organizations. We investigate the best methodology to perform microblog summarization of topics discussed on Twitter. First, we classify the microblogs related to the topic into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and then we extract sub-topics (i.e., topic aspects), and pick the top N ranked aspects by sentiment temperature for final summarization. We utilize known algorithms for annotation, sentiment analysis, and clustering to determine which combination yields the best results. This paper attempts to address how sentiment analysis in conjunction with aspect extraction of topics can yield more effective summarization. Evaluation results show that sentiment analysis and aspect extraction improve the overall summarization of topics compared to baseline technique.",
