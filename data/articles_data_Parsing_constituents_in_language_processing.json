        "abstract": "We propose SP-NLG: A semantic-parsing-guided natural language generation framework for logical content generation with high fidelity. Prior studies adopt large pretrained language models and coarse-to-fine decoding techniques to generate text with logic; while achieving considerable results on automatic evaluation metrics, they still face challenges in terms of logical fidelity based on human evaluation. Inspired by semantic parsing, which translates natural language utterances into executable logical forms, we propose to guide the generation process with a semantic parser. Different from semantic parsing and QA tasks, of which the logical correctness can be evaluated based on the execution result, the logic information of the generated content is implicit. To leverage a semantic parser for generation, we propose a slot-tied back-search algorithm. We follow the coarse-to-fine generation scheme, but instead of filling the slots with model predictions, which is less uncontrolled, the slot values are offline searched by the algorithm. The slot-tied back-search algorithm ties the parameters of a logic form with the slots of a template in one-to-one correspondence. We back-search the arguments that correctly execute the logic form and fill the arguments (as slot values) into the textual template to generate the final target, which ensures the logical correctness. Experiment results of a model built on SP-NLG demonstrates that our framework achieves high fidelity on logical text generation.",

        "abstract": "It is broadly accepted that the prosody of a sentence can influence sentence processing by providing the listener information about the syntax of the sentence. It is less clear what the mechanism is that underlies the transmission of this information. In this paper, we test whether the influence of the prosodic structure on parsing is a result of perceptual breaks such as pauses or whether it is the result of more abstract prosodic elements, such as intonational phrases. In three experiments, we test whether different types of perceptual breaks, e.g., intonational boundaries (Experiment 1), an artificial buzzing sound (Experiment 2), and an isolated pause (Experiment 3), influence syntactic attachment in ambiguous sentences. We find that although full intonational boundaries influence syntactic disambiguation, the artificial buzz and isolated pause do not. These data rule out theories that argue that perceptual breaks indirectly influence grammatical attachment through memory mechanisms, and instead, show that listeners use prosodic breaks themselves as cues to parsing.",

        "abstract": "Arabic, known for its rich morphological and syntactic complexity, poses significant challenges for natural language processing technologies. This study presents a comparative evaluation of two artificial intelligence tools, ChatGPT and Cloude, in their abilities to parse Arabic sentences accurately. Five sentences embodying diverse linguistic features were selected, and the parsing outputs were evaluated by three Arabic language experts. The results revealed a clear performance gap, with Cloude outperforming ChatGPT in overall accuracy (72.9% vs. 33.3%). Cloude excelled in handling morphological complexities and basic syntactic relationships but encountered difficulties with highly idiomatic expressions and ambiguous constructions. Conversely, ChatGPT struggled with complex morphology and long-distance dependencies. The findings highlight the importance of developing specialized Arabic language processing tools while acknowledging the potential of general-purpose language models with further fine-tuning. Recommendations include incorporating domain-specific knowledge, leveraging transfer learning, and exploring ensemble approaches to enhance the accuracy and robustness of AI-based Arabic parsing systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nLarge multilingual language models typically share their parameters across all languages, which enables cross-lingual task transfer, but learning can also be hindered when training updates from different languages are in conflict. In this article, we propose novel methods for using language-specific subnetworks, which control cross-lingual parameter sharing, to reduce conflicts and increase positive transfer during fine-tuning. We introduce dynamic subnetworks, which are jointly updated with the model, and we combine our methods with meta-learning, an established, but complementary, technique for improving cross-lingual transfer. Finally, we provide extensive analyses of how each of our methods affects the models.",

The tei xml tags at the word and morpheme levels are shown to be suitable to account for the abundant agglutinative morphology of the language. The advantages of visualising sound–spelling equivalences across the various spelling systems in the corpus are also emphasised.

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper explores how to syntactically parse Ancient Greek texts automatically and maps ways of fruitfully employing the results of such an automated analysis. Special attention is given to documentary papyrus texts, a large diachronic corpus of non-literary Greek, which presents a unique set of challenges to tackle. By making use of the Stanford Graph-Based Neural Dependency Parser, we show that through careful curation of the parsing data and several manipulation strategies, it is possible to achieve an Labeled Attachment Score of about 0.85 for this corpus. We also explain how the data can be converted back to its original (Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks) format. We describe the results of several tests we have carried out to improve parsing results, with special attention paid to the impact of the annotation format on parser achievements. In addition, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis of the remaining errors, including possible ways to solve them. Moreover, the paper gives an overview of the valorisation possibilities of an automatically annotated corpus of Ancient Greek texts in the fields of linguistics, language education and humanities studies in general. The concluding section critically analyses the remaining difficulties and outlines avenues to further improve the parsing quality and the ensuing practical applications.",

        "abstract": "AbstractSemantic frames are formal structures describing situations, actions or events, e.g., Commerce buy, Kidnapping, or Exchange. Each frame provides a set of frame elements or semantic roles corresponding to participants of the situation and lexical units (LUs)—words and phrases that can evoke this particular frame in texts. For example, for the frame Kidnapping, two key roles are Perpetrator and the Victim, and this frame can be evoked with lexical units abduct, kidnap, or snatcher. While formally sound, the scarce availability of semantic frame resources and their limited lexical coverage hinders the wider adoption of frame semantics across languages and domains. To tackle this problem, firstly, we propose a method that takes as input a few frame-annotated sentences and generates alternative lexical realizations of lexical units and semantic roles matching the original frame definition. Secondly, we show that the obtained synthetically generated semantic frame annotated examples help to improve the quality of frame-semantic parsing. To evaluate our proposed approach, we decompose our work into two parts. In the first part of text augmentation for LUs and roles, we experiment with various types of models such as distributional thesauri, non-contextualized word embeddings (word2vec, fastText, GloVe), and Transformer-based contextualized models, such as BERT or XLNet. We perform the intrinsic evaluation of these induced lexical substitutes using FrameNet gold annotations. Models based on Transformers show overall superior performance, however, they do not always outperform simpler models (based on static embeddings) unless information about the target word is suitably injected. However, we observe that non-contextualized models also show comparable performance on the task of LU expansion. We also show that combining substitutes of individual models can significantly improve the quality of final substitutes. Because intrinsic evaluation scores are highly dependent on the gold dataset and the frame preservation, and cannot be ensured by an automatic evaluation mechanism because of the incompleteness of gold datasets, we also carried out experiments with manual evaluation on sample datasets to further analyze the usefulness of our approach. The results show that the manual evaluation framework significantly outperforms automatic evaluation for lexical substitution. For extrinsic evaluation, the second part of this work assesses the utility of these lexical substitutes for the improvement of frame-semantic parsing. We took a small set of frame-annotated sentences and augmented them by replacing corresponding target words with their closest substitutes, obtained from best-performing models. Our extensive experiments on the original and augmented set of annotations with two semantic parsers show that our method is effective for improving the downstream parsing task by training set augmentation, as well as for quickly building FrameNet-like resources for new languages or subject domains.",

        "abstract": "Human parsing has great application prospects in the field of computer vision, but there are still many problems. In the existing algorithms, the problems of small-scale target location and the problem of background occlusion have not been fully resolved, which will lead to wrong segmentation or incomplete segmentation. Compared with the existing practice of feature concatenation, using the correlation between two factors can make full use of edge information for refined parsing. This paper proposes the mechanism of correlation edge and parsing network (MCEP), which uses the spatial aware and two max-pooling (SMP) module to capture the correlation. The structure mainly includes two steps, namely (1) collection operation, where, through the mutual promotion of edge features and parsing features, more attention is paid to the region of interest around the edge of the human body, and the spatial clues of the human body are collected adaptively, and (2) filtering operation, where parallel max-pooling is adopted to solve the background occlusion problem. Meanwhile, semantic context feature extraction capability is endowed to enhance feature extraction capability and prevent small target detail loss. Through a large number of experiments on multiple single-person and multi-person datasets, this method has greater advantages.",

        "abstract": "There is scope to enhance agricultural measurement and control systems user interactivity, which typically necessitates training for users to perform specific operations successfully. With the continuous development of natural language semantic processing technology, it has become essential to augment the user-friendliness of multifaceted control and query operations in the agricultural measurement and control sector, ultimately leading to reduced operation costs for users. The study aims to focus on command parsing. The proposed AMR-OPO semantic parsing framework is based on the natural language understanding method of Abstract Meaning Representation of Rooted Markup Graphs (AMR). It transforms the user’s natural language inputs into structured ternary (OPO) statements (operation-place-object) and converts the corresponding parameters of the user’s input commands. The framework subsequently sends the transformed commands to the relevant devices via the IoT gateway. To tackle the intricate task of parsing instructions, we developed a BERT-BiLSTM-ATT-CRF-OPO entity recognition model. This model can detect and extract entities from agricultural instructions, and precisely populate them into OPO statements. Our model shows exceptional accuracy in instruction parsing, with precision, recall, and F-value all measuring at 92.13%, 93.12%, and 92.76%, correspondingly. The findings from our experiment reveal outstanding and precise performance of our approach. It is anticipated that our algorithm will enhance the user experience offered by agricultural measurement and control systems, while also making them more user-friendly.",

        "abstract": "Computer intelligent recognition technology refers to the use of computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning and other technologies to enable computers to recognize, analyze, understand and answer human language and behavior. The common applications of computer intelligent recognition technology include image recognition, NLP, face recognition, target tracking and other fields. NLP is a field of computer science, which involves the interaction between computers and natural languages. NLP technology can be used to process, analyze and generate natural language data, such as text, voice and image. Common NLP technology applications include language translation, emotion analysis, text classification, speech recognition and question answering system. Language model is a machine learning model, which uses a large number of text data for training to learn language patterns and relationships in text data. Although the language model has made great progress in the past few years, it still faces some challenges, including: poor semantic understanding, confusion in multilingual processing, slow language processing and other shortcomings. Therefore, in order to optimize these shortcomings, this paper would study the pre-training language model based on NLP technology, which aimed to use NLP technology to optimize and improve the performance of the language model, thus optimizing the computer intelligent recognition technology. The model had higher language understanding ability and more accurate prediction ability. In addition, the model could learn language rules and structures by using a large number of corpus, so as to better understand natural language. Through experiments, it could be known that the data size and total computing time of the traditional Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) language model were 10G and 97 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) were 12GB and 86 hours respectively. The data size and total computing time of the pre-training language model based on NLP were 18GB and 71 hours respectively. Obviously, the pre-training language model based on NLP had a larger data size and shorter computing time. The experimental results showed that the NLP technology could better optimize the language model and effectively improve its various capabilities. This paper opened up a new development direction for computer intelligent recognition technology and provided excellent technical support for the development of language models.",

For Chinese-speaking learners of Korean (Chinese group), agreement between an honorific numeral quantifier and a noun in Korean constitutes transferable information in the canonical structure and nontransferable L2-specific information in the scrambled structure. For Japanese-speaking learners of Korean (Japanese group), this information gives rise to crosslinguistic conflicts in both structures. The results from a self-paced reading task showed that the Japanese group did not exhibit sensitivity to grammatical errors in both structures, whereas the Chinese group detected the agreement violation in the canonical but not in the scrambled structure. When a context sentence was provided to license scrambling in the test sentence, however, another group of Chinese-speaking learners of Korean showed sensitivity to the violation. These findings suggest varying degrees of crosslinguistic influence in L2 sentence processing.",

        "abstract": "AbstractThis paper describes the first data-driven parser for Vedic Sanskrit, an ancient Indo-Aryan language in which a corpus of important religious and philosophical texts has been composed. We report and critically discuss experiments with the input feature representations, paying special attention to the performance of contextualized word embeddings and to the influence of morpho-syntactic representations on the parsing quality. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of the parsing errors that covers structural traits of the predicted trees as well as linguistic and extra-textual influence factors. In its optimal configuration, the proposed model achieves 87.61 unlabeled and 81.84 labeled attachment score on a held-out set of test sentences, demonstrating good performance for an under-resourced language.",

        "abstract": "Language translation is highly needed in the increasingly networked world. The writing of English essays is an essential competency for higher education students. For non-English students in China, this is especially important. They often represent large numbers of Chinese English as second language students. Therefore this paper introduced Deep Structured Learning with Natural language processing (DSL-NLP) has been proposed to convert the Chinese language to the English language for student learning. An automatic input tool for writing assistance will be beneficial in building the proposed DSL-NLP method. The relationship between textual attributes and input from human teachers and provide characteristics feedback system. This study explored natural language processing (NLP) to determine the interpretative actions required for a successful understanding of the literary text. NLP attempts to assist in achieving consistency in applied linguistics, improving classroom communication, optimizing learner attitudes and motivation, raising personality, facilitating personal development, and even changing students' perspectives toward life. Thus the experimental results show the DSL-NLP improves student learning in the English language, enhances student performance in education, and effectively increases the student career",

Quality teaching determines student success. This study presents an AI-based deep learning method for second language and English instruction. This dataset was collected from students' second language and English teaching preferences. Dimensionality reduction and missing value removal were done on the dataset. Fuzzy set-based clustering with stochastic gradient residual neural network (ResNet) architecture classified this processed data. Students' second language and English teaching opinions were collected using fuzzy rules. Fuzzy clustering and stochastic gradient ResNet architecture classified this data. Student opinion mining was used for experimental study of various datasets and the parametric analysis yielded 96% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 82% F-1 score, 72% Mean squared error (MSE), and 88% Area Under the Curve (AUC).",

Specifically, this study examines how fast and accurately monolingual and bilingual subjects receiving either PI or a control, output-oriented treatment, process numeral classifiers ba and tai in Mandarin Chinese. Participants’ onset of correct response during training was measured by trials-to-criterion. Improvements over time were assessed using a sentence-level interpretation task at pre-test and post-test. Results indicate similar learning rates and accuracy on the post-test for all participants trained with PI. In the control condition, however, the bilinguals displayed better accuracy than their monolingual peers on the post-test, even though the onset of their correct responses during training did not differ significantly. Because the monolingual and bilingual-PI groups each outperformed the two control groups on both assessment measures, these results suggest that PI allowed participants to compensate for the effects of their LBD.",

        "abstract": "Sentiment analysis has witnessed significant advancements particularly in a translanguaging paradigm, emphasizing the entanglement of different languages, modalities, and cultures. This article provides an overview of the translanguaging advances in sentiment analysis, covering techniques, applications, and challenges. The article begins by briefly introducing the major trends of sentiment analysis, highlighting its current importance in understanding and analyzing human emotions and opinions expressed in data. It then delves into the edge-cutting techniques employed in sentiment analysis. Afterwards, the emerging application domains were explored through CiteSpace 5.7.R5. Despite the achievements made in sentiment analysis, numerous challenges persist. The last part of this article presents the challenges and researchers’ attempted solutions, which accentuates the need for robust techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis.",

        "abstract": " Recent studies have accumulated to suggest that children, akin to adults, exhibit a processing advantage for formulaic language (e.g. save energy) over novel language (e.g. sell energy), as well as sensitivity to phrase frequencies. The majority of these studies are based on formulaic sequences in their canonical form. In natural language use, however, many formulaic sequences, collocations in particular, can be modified with words intervening in between the individual constituents (e.g. save energy → save all forms of energy). For some collocations, their nonadjacent forms are equally, and even more frequently used than their adjacent form. Despite this, it remains almost unknown whether the processing advantage and sensitivity to phrase frequencies persist in nonadjacent collocations in children. Based on reading times in a self-paced reading experiment, the current study found that two age groups – third and sixth graders – exhibited a processing advantage for Chinese collocations and sensitivity to phrase frequencies, with two and even four Chinese characters inserted in the middle. The persistence of processing advantage and sensitivity was affected by insertion length as well as age. These results are in line with a usage-based theoretical approach to language learning, processing and use. ",
