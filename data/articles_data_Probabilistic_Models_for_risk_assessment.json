The NH 31A road falls with east Sikkim Himalaya which has highly deformed by numerous landslide events. Over the few years the NH 31A road sections and settlement with its surrounding areas are invaded by landslide events. To resolve the problem connected to landslide, landslide susceptibility zones (LSZ) and landslide risk assessment (LRA) is an urgent and safe mitigation measure to helping the strategic planning for local people. The present study is an endeavor to take advantage of bivariate statistical method called frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV) and certainty factor (CF) analysis for LSZ and LRA map and attempt to get out the triggering factors for the LSI and LRA in Rorachu watershed, East Sikkim. The landslide inventory map was made by the more premature reports, aerial photograph, Google Earth image and multiple field visits. A total 153 landslides location were mapped using GIS software and divided into 70 % (107) for training data for the modeling using FR, IV and CF models and remaining 30 % (46) were used for validating the models. The thirteen landslide causative factors Geology, Soil, Elevations, Slope, Curvature, drainage Density (DD), Road Density (RD), Rainfall, Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Use Land Cover (LULC), Topographic Position Index (TPI), Stream Power Index (SPI) and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) were extracted from spatial database for the LSZ mapping using FR, IV and CF models. The landslide susceptibility zonation (LSM) map also tested by the histogram and density plot, this is elicited most of the triggering factors for the landslides in Rorachu watershed. The results have been showing that the slope (35o to 50o), elevations (2,500 – 4,100 m) and rainfall (2000- 2,500 mm and 3,000 – 3,300 mm) is the intensest concentration and density for the landslides. The predictive frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV) and certainty factor (CF) model has been validated by receive operating characteristics (ROC) curve, Success rate curve (SRC) and landslide density (LD) method analysis. The result shows that AUC for success rate curves (SRC) are 0.925 (92.50 %), 0.846 (84.60 %) and 0.868 (86.80 %), respectively for frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV) and certainty factor (CF) models. And the result shows that AUC for prediction rates are 0.828 (82.80 %), 0.750 (75 %) and 0.836 (83.60 %), respectively for the FR, IV and CF models. The element-at-risk (Settlement and Road) is revealed the landslide risk assessment (LRA) have been showing that the most significant risk of settlements areas by the model of FR (9%), IV (38.59%) and CF (20.90%) and the most significant risk of NH 31A road is FR (20.72%), IV (40.91%) and CF (18.78%). These landslide susceptibility maps and landslide risk assessment (LRA) map can be used for the development of land use planning strategies, saves human loss and important for the planners and mitigation purpose. So remarkable attention should be taken into consideration for the highway construction, deforestation and urbanization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe Sikkim Himalaya has been identified as a zone with a high risk of slope instability. The NH 31A route runs through the east Sikkim Himalaya, which has been severely affected by landslides. Over the last few years, landslide occurrences have engulfed the NH 31A road portions and town, as well as the adjacent countryside. Landslide susceptibility zones (LSZ) and landslide risk assessment (LRA) are an urgent and safe mitigation tool for local residents to help with strategic planning in the event of a landslide. The current study aims to use a bivariate statistical method termed frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), and certainty factor (CF) analysis for LSZ and LRA maps in Rorachu watershed, East Sikkim, in order to determine the triggering reasons for the LSI and LRA. This is the first time this work has been done in the NH31A and settlement areas in east Sikkim. Early reports, aerial photographs, Google Earth images, and repeated field visits were used to create the landslide inventory map. A total of 153 landslide locations were mapped using GIS software, with 70% (107) being utilised as training data for modelling using the FR, IV, and CF models, and the remaining 30% (46) being used to validate the models. The thirteen landslide causative factors Geology, Soil, Elevations, Slope, Curvature, Drainage Density (DD), Road Density (RD), Rainfall, Normalize Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Use Land Cover (LULC), Topographic Position Index (TPI), Stream Power Index (SPI), and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) were extracted from a spatial database for LSZ mapping using the FR, IV, and CF The histogram and density plot have been used to test the landslide susceptibility zonation (LSM) map, that elicited the preponderance of the triggering conditions for landslides in the Rorachu watershed. The slope (35o to 50o), heights (2,500–4,100 m), and rainfall (2000–2,500 mm and 3,000–3,300 mm) were found to have the highest proportion and density for landslides. Receive operating characteristics (ROC) curve, Success rate curve (SRC), and landslide density (LD) method analysis are all used to validate the predicted frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), and certainty factor (CF) model. For frequency ratio (FR), information value (IV), and certainty factor (CF) models, the AUC for success rate curves (SRC) are 0.925 (92.50%), 0.846 (84.60%), and 0.868 (86.80%), respectively. The AUC for prediction rates for the FR, IV, and CF models are 0.828 (82.80%), 0.750 (%), and 0.836 (83.60%), respectively. The landslide risk assessment (LRA) is revealed that the most significant risk of settlements places are FR (20.72%), IV (40.91%), and CF (20.90%), and the most significant danger of NH 31A road is FR (20.72%), IV (40.91%), and CF (20.90%) (18.78%). These landslide susceptibility maps and landslide risk assessment (LRA) maps can be used to generate land use planning strategies, saving people's lives and also being beneficial for planners and mitigation. Highway construction, deforestation, and urbanization should be given special consideration.",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman reliability analysis is a method, which evaluates the human error probabilities of human failure events, which may arise when human actions are required in operation of the considered facility or system. The objective of the work is to show the contribution of human failure events in probabilistic safety assessment with focus on comparison of this contribution over the different plant operating states. The method integrates the diagnosis and action part, which are evaluated for all steps, which are needed for modeling of the human action under investigation considering the parameters, which impact the human failure probability and which are obtained from database. The results show that the risk contribution of human failure events is notably higher in low power and shutdown states than in full power operation. The results show that the human factor in shutdown plant states is the most important risk contributor regarding the contribution to the core damage frequency and regarding the risk reduction worth and risk achievement worth. Only at some plant operating states, some other groups of equipment show larger risk achievement worth than group of human failure events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Mountain hazard risk analysis for transport infrastructure is regularly based on deterministic approaches. Due to a variety of variables and data needed for risk computation, a considerable degree of epistemic uncertainty results. Consequently, input data needed for risk assessment is normally processed as mean values with or without scatter, or as an individual deterministic value from expert judgement if no statistical data is available. To overcome this gap, we used a probabilistic approach to express the potential bandwidth of input data with two different distribution functions, taking a mountain road in the Eastern European Alps as case study. The risk assessment included the damage potential of road infrastructure and traffic exposed to a multi-hazard environment (torrent processes, snow avalanches, rock fall). Reliable quantiles of the calculated probability density distributions attributed to the aggregated road risk due to the impact of multiple-mountain hazards were compared to the deterministic results from the standard guidelines on road safety. The results clearly show that with common deterministic approaches risk is significantly underestimated in comparison to a probabilistic risk modelling setup, mainly due to epistemic uncertainties of the input data. The study provides added value to further develop standardized road safety guidelines and may therefore be of particular importance for road authorities and political decision-makers.\n                        ",

        "abstract": " The use of supplemental viscous damping significantly improves the seismic performance of buildings; however, a design procedure that considers seismic risk is necessary. The aim of this article is to simplify the seismic risk assessment of mid-rise steel frames with linear viscous fluid dampers by employing probabilistic models and a reliability analysis. The development of a probabilistic seismic response model (PSRM) to predict the structural response without performing extensive computation is a principal component of this methodology. The design and modeling of generic frames, record selection, cloud analysis, assessment of candidate intensity measures, and use of vector-valued intensity measures are the primary aspects of this study, the goal of which is to put forward a PSRM for the target frames. Comparison of the PSRM outcome with the results of case studies demonstrates the acceptable accuracy of the models for the design earthquake; these models lead to a reduction in the computation and complexity involved in selecting design variables to achieve a target risk.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe catastrophic Fukushima nuclear accident reminded the nuclear community about potential extreme accident scenarios, including those involving multiple reactor units on the same site. In response to the Fukushima accident, the nuclear power industry developed and implemented a series of strategies, including Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies (FLEX), to enhance the capacities of nuclear power plants (NPPs) to cope with extreme accidents. This study examines the impact of FLEX strategies on the overall risk from all reactor units located at the same NPP site, including risks from accidents involving either a single unit or multiple units. The fundamental, methodological element of this study is Multi-Unit Probabilistic Risk Assessment (MUPRA) requiring a shift in Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) from a one-reactor-at-a-time mindset to a consideration of all reactors sharing a site. An integrated modeling approach for multi-unit event sequence development is leveraged to develop the MUPRA model and address intra-unit and inter-unit dependencies. Systems Analysis Programs for Hands-on Integrated Reliability Evaluations (SAPHIRE), a PRA software developed and maintained by Idaho National Laboratory for the United States (U.S.) Nuclear Regulatory Commission, serves as the platform for MUPRA modeling. This study selects loss of offsite power (LOOP) as a representative initiating event potentially occurring on a generic two-unit NPP site and impacting both reactor units. First, an MUPRA model, including multi-unit event trees, is developed to obtain single-unit and multi-unit accident scenarios. Next, different FLEX strategies are assumed; for example, whether FLEX equipment for multiple units can be used in a cross-connected manner. Lastly, the effectiveness of each postulated FLEX strategy is evaluated by incorporating the corresponding FLEX equipment and deployment logic into the MUPRA model.",
